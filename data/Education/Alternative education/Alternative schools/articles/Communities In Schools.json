than 1.5 million children in 2,300 schools. The essence of its approach, rooted in the Christian principles that inspired founder Bill Milliken\u2014go where the kids are, build trusting relationships with them, and treat the whole person\u2014has remained remarkably consistent over 40 years even as the organization has continued to evolve and adapt. It is a fascinating story that speaks to CIS\u2019s essential identity as a pioneer, innovator, and leader in the movement to help at-risk kids stay in school and achieve in life.\n</p><p>That story begins with a crucial lesson from Milliken\u2019s own experience with the street and postal academies: that having impact on a problem of this scale and complexity, especially in inherently conservative public school systems, meant building a sustainable enterprise and running it according to sound management principles.\n</p><p>Over the next 25 years, CIS learned other important lessons: That working in partnership with others was both necessary and preferable; that private sector funding was vital not just to the financial health of the organization but also to its credibility with the schools and communities that CIS sought to engage; and that a nonpartisan approach was critical to their success in an increasingly polarized climate for educational reform. The last 15 years, meanwhile, have witnessed a profound transformation at CIS: from a visionary, mission-driven enterprise led by a charismatic founder-entrepreneur to a mature, professionally managed, data-driven enterprise that uses research and evaluation to influence and innovate.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Dropout_Epidemic\">Dropout Epidemic</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Communities_In_Schools&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Dropout Epidemic\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Dropout_Statistics\">Dropout Statistics</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Communities_In_Schools&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Dropout Statistics\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<dl><dd><ul><li>One million American students drop out of school each year</li>\n<li>Nearly half of all dropouts ages 16-24 are unemployed</li>\n<li>An estimated 67% of prison inmates are high school dropouts</li>\n<li>Graduation rate nationally is around 70%, declining to 50% in some urban areas<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup></li>\n<li>Every 29 seconds another student gives up on school</li>\n<li>dropouts earn $9,200 less per year than high school graduates and more than $1 million less over a lifetime than college graduates</li>\n<li>the government would gain $45 billion in extra tax revenues and reduced costs in public health, crime, and welfare payments if the number of high school dropouts among 20-year-olds in the US today were cut in half<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup></li></ul></dd></dl>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Network\">The Network</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Communities_In_Schools&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: The Network\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20080616101926/http://www.cisnet.org/\">Communities In Schools</a> network comprises a national office located in Arlington, Va., 13 state offices and nearly 160 local affiliates.

Community-based integrated student services are interventions that improve student achievement by connecting community resources with both the academic and social-service needs of students. Such interventions focus programmatic energy, resources and time on shared school and student goals. Through the efforts of a single point of contact, individual student needs are assessed and research-based connections made between students and targeted community resources.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> Asset building resources such as health screenings, food and clothing, and assemblies on various topics are made available to all students. Targeted and sustained intervention services are provided to the subset of students most in need, forming the basis of outcome-driven individual student plans. These students benefit from tutors, mentors, after-school programs, academic support and other evidence-based interventions designed to achieve specific outcomes.\n</p><p>Communities In Schools becomes involved at the invitation of the school or school district. The CIS model is adaptable to all communities\u2014 whether urban, rural or suburban\u2014 and is tailored to meet the needs of the individual school and its students. The National Evaluation of Communities In Schools is being conducted to measure the impact and the effectiveness of the Communities In Schools model. The core elements of the CIS model identified within the study and being measured are the following:\n</p>\n<ul><li>The presence of a CIS school-based, on-site coordinator;</li>\n<li>A comprehensive school- and student-level needs assessment;</li>\n<li>A community asset assessment and identification of potential partners;</li>\n<li>Annual plans for school-level prevention and individual intervention strategies;</li>\n<li>The delivery of appropriate combinations of widely accessible prevention services and resources for the entire school population, coupled with coordinated, targeted and sustained intervention services and resources for individual students with significant risk factors; and</li>\n<li>Data collection and evaluation over time, with monitoring and modifications of services offered to individual students and/or the entire school population, as appropriate.<sup id=\"cite_ref-publication_eval_6-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-publication_eval-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup></li></ul>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Provided_Services\">Provided Services</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Communities_In_Schools&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: Provided Services\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Communities In Schools identifies and delivers two levels of service to students.

Some examples of Level One resources or services include providing clothing or school supplies, assemblies, events, career fairs, field trips, health screenings and grief counseling.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Level_Two_-_Targeted_and_Sustained_Services\">Level Two - Targeted and Sustained Services</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Communities_In_Schools&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11\" title=\"Edit section: Level Two - Targeted and Sustained Services\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Unlike Level one, from which virtually any student in a school may benefit, Level Two resources and services are provided through well-defined CIS initiatives targeted at students and/or families with specific needs. These initiatives typically include some type of enrollment or assignment procedure. They are sustained interventions with durations of several weeks, months or an entire school year. Level Two services are usually designed to achieve one or more tracked outcomes such as improved academic performance, attendance or behavior. These outcomes are chosen based on a variety of assessments and teacher recommendations. Examples of such interventions include tutoring, mentoring, literary skills, case management, individual counseling, before- and after-school programs, community service and enrollment in an \"academy\" environment.<sup id=\"cite_ref-results07-16_7-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-results07-16-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"National_Evaluation\">National Evaluation</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Communities_In_Schools&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12\" title=\"Edit section: National Evaluation\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Overview\">Overview</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Communities_In_Schools&amp;action=edit&amp;section=13\" title=\"Edit section: Overview\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In 2005 Communities In Schools was awarded a multiyear fourteen million dollar contract to conduct an evaluation of its national network and programming.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ICF_8-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ICF-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> <a href=\"/wiki/ICF_International\" title=\"ICF International\">ICF International</a><sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>, a global consulting and research firm, was contracted to conduct the five-year longitudinal study titled the National Evaluation of Communities In Schools.    The study was designed to determine the effectiveness of the Communities In Schools model. It is based on an in-depth analysis of 1,776 schools served by CIS, a comparative analysis of outcomes from more than 1,200 CIS served and non-CIS served comparison schools, and comparative analysis of CIS served students and non-CIS served students alongside in-depth case studies of students.

Through random assignment, researches are able to make the two groups as similar in composition as possible. By minimizing differences between the two groups, any difference in outcomes can be attributed to participation in the CIS program.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Results\">Results</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Communities_In_Schools&amp;action=edit&amp;section=17\" title=\"Edit section: Results\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Phase_One:_Implementation_Results\">Phase One: Implementation Results</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Communities_In_Schools&amp;action=edit&amp;section=18\" title=\"Edit section: Phase One: Implementation Results\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The first phase involved a survey of more than 1,500 schools served by Communities In Schools to determine the level of CIS implementation taking place at each school. Based on the survey results, the schools were given a score from 1-100, based on their degree of fidelity to core components of the CIS model. When scores were correlated with school-level outcomes, the cohort of sites scoring 70 or higher showed the most positive outcomes. This established the relationship between outcomes and the level of implementation of the CIS model. The group, referred to as \"high implementing schools,\" represents 47 percent (710) of total sample sites. The remaining 808 sites, referred to as \"partial implementing schools,\" implemented the CIS model to a lesser degree.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Phase_Two:_School-Level_Studies_Results\">Phase Two: School-Level Studies Results</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Communities_In_Schools&amp;action=edit&amp;section=19\" title=\"Edit section: Phase Two: School-Level Studies Results\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In the second phase, ICF sought to determine the extent to which positive student outcomes could be attributed to implementation of the Communities In Schools model. ICF conducted a quasi-experimental evaluation, matching 602 schools served by CIS against 602 comparison schools. Each school served by CIS was matched with a school not served by CIS based on eight characteristics of the schools: student attendance rates; percent of students qualifying for free or reduced-price lunch; percent of students with special needs; school size; percentage of students designated as proficient in math; percentage of students designated as proficient in English/language arts; the racial and ethnic composition of the schools; and the \"promoting power\" of the schools ( a proxy for \"dropout rate\"). In 2008, ICF along with Communities In Schools released the initial results from Phase Two. The three key findings were:\n</p>\n<ol><li>Among dropout prevention programs using scientifically based evidence, the CIS model is one of a very few in the United States proven to keep students in school and is the only dropout prevention program in the nation with scientifically based evidence to prove that it increases graduation rates.</li></ol>\n<ol><li>When implemented with high fidelity, the CIS model results in a higher percentage of students reaching proficiency in fourth- and eighth-grade reading and math.</li>\n<li>Effective implementation of the CIS model correlates more strongly with positive school-level outcomes (i.e., dropout and graduation rates, achievement, etc.) than does the uncoordinated provision of service alone, resulting in notable improvements of school level outcomes in the context of the CIS model.<sup id=\"cite_ref-publication_eval_6-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-publication_eval-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup></li></ol>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Phase_Three:_Student-Level_Studies_Results\">Phase Three: Student-Level Studies Results</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Communities_In_Schools&amp;action=edit&amp;section=20\" title=\"Edit section: Phase Three: Student-Level Studies Results\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>As of 2007, randomized controlled trials are being conducted in CIS of Central Texas in Austin, Texas and in CIS of Jacksonville, Florida.
