While debate persists in Alaska, the state has adopted its own new standards called the Alaska Content and Performance Standards that Education Commissioner Mike Hanley has described as "substantially similar" to the Common Core standards, and many local districts have chosen to adopt the standards even though the state has not.

The grant remains controversial with California teacher's unions because of concerns of the use and size of the grant.  California is a governing member of SBAC.  Colorado formally adopted the Standards in 2010. Citizen concerns about Common Core, however, have resulted in a bill drafted by a parent group to delay implementation and appoint an independent panel to look at the standards, with State Senator Vicki Marble agreeing to carry it in the legislature.  Connecticut formally adopted the Standards, but Governor Dannel Malloy has called for a delay in teacher evaluations based on Common Core testing, citing the stress of changing systems and saying "it's important that we relieve the significant demands on teachers and administrators and systems."

Issues have also prompted the state's leading teacher union, New York State Teachers United, to withdraw their support of the standards "as implemented," also calling for the resignation of State Education Commissioner John King and a three-year moratorium on testing.
