The homework gap refers to the difficulty students experience completing homework when they lack internet access at home, compared to those who have access.  According to a Pew Research Center analysis of the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey data from 2013, there were approximately 5 million households with school-age children in the United States that lacked access to high-speed Internet service.  Low-income households and minority households made up a “disproportionate” share of those 5 million households; 31.4% of households with school-age children whose incomes fell below $50,000 fell into the group without internet access at home.  According to Pew, this group makes up about 40% of all families with school-age children in the United States.  Policymakers in the United States have highlighted the homework gap as an issue of national importance. President Barack Obama cited the homework gap in launching the ConnectHome initiative in July 2015.  Senator Angus King (I-ME) and Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) introduced legislation on the topic.  FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, who is credited with coining the term the “homework gap,”  has encouraged changes to U.S. broadband internet and wi-fi policies to address this problem.
