This unique academic learning approach capitalizes on students\u2019 strengths and creates a deep level of understanding that allows children to use what they\u2019ve learned in new and different situations.\n</p><p>Teaching and learning go beyond the traditional approaches; too often schools only consider the linguistic and mathematical subjects when talking about how intelligence is measured. The theory of multiple intelligences (MI) advocates that there are eight intelligences that need to be nurtured and developed in children: linguistic, logical-mathematical, spatial, musical, bodily-kinesthetic, naturalist, interpersonal, and intrapersonal.\n</p><p>These all reflect different ways of interacting with the world of thinking, solving problems, and learning. Proponents of multiple intelligences believe everyone has all of the intelligences; it is just that each person has his/her own unique multiple intelligences profile. Multiple intelligences is a tool which allows New City teachers to expose students to new concepts and skills in multiple ways, and also allows students to demonstrate their understanding in a variety of ways.\n</p><p>While the school ensures its students are capable learners who often exceed the grade level expectations on standardized measures, New City strives to challenge its students to go above and beyond those measures.  Multiple intelligences serves as a vehicle by which this is accomplished.\n</p><p>Some examples of how multiple intelligence theory is being used in the classroom setting at New City School are:  \n</p>\n<ul><li>groups working together to solve a complex problem</li>\n<li>students acting out a historical event</li>\n<li>students sharing a book or story by using one or more of their intelligences</li>\n<li>students giving and/or receiving thoughtful and constructive feedback</li>\n<li>students using different percussion instruments to represent each component of the digestive system</li>\n<li>students building models of a new insect species</li>\n<li>students creating bar graphs to illustrate the many similarities and differences in skin color</li>\n<li>students making Venn diagrams comparing themselves to a story character</li>\n<li>students planting Native American crops in the garden</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Green_efforts_at_New_City_School\">Green efforts at New City School</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=New_City_School&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Green efforts at New City School\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Since the 1990s, New City has made a conscious effort to \"go green.\" These efforts began with a student recycling program, and have progressed to the installation of a green roof on the cafeteria roof in 2009, and most recently, the installation of solar panels in 2013.\n</p><p>Throughout this period, students and teachers have worked to be more environmentally aware. Students recycle food products, school supplies, paper, cardboard, plastic, and cans, and the school has instituted a policy of using sustainable materials whenever possible.\n</p><p>New City\u2019s Green Committee and popular River Kids program lead the school's efforts towards sustainability.\nGreen efforts at New City include but are not limited to the following endeavors:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Rain barrels in the garden area and on the green roof</li>\n<li>Lights changed from T12 to T8</li>\n<li>Programmable thermostats throughout the building</li>\n<li>Auto-flush urinals and toilets throughout the building</li>\n<li>Auto on/off faucets</li>\n<li>Hand dryers</li>\n<li>Paper &amp; plastic recycle bins for community and parent use</li>\n<li>Low-E argon gas insulated glass windows</li>\n<li>Green cleaning products used</li>\n<li>Washable coffee mugs</li>\n<li>Motion sensors installed in select locations to turn off lights when a room is not in use</li>\n<li>Vending machine control to turn off machine when not in use</li>\n<li>E-mail signatures to encourage readers not to print e-mail</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Faculty_and_staff\">Faculty and staff</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=New_City_School&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: Faculty and staff\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Head_of_School\">Head of School</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=New_City_School&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10\" title=\"Edit section: Head of School\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Thomas R.
