The School is an intensive residential program conducted on two college campuses in the state. Emphasis is placed on problem solving of complex issues that exist on the local, state, national, and international levels. To foster creativity, the program provides no grades or academic credit.\n</p><p>Since 2006, the program has been primarily funded privately, yet is still free of charge for its students. The available programs have decreased from a high of six. In 2013, only two schools were held: the School in the Sciences, and the School of Engineering &amp; Technology.  For 2014, the School of Engineering &amp; Technology will run for four weeks; the Sciences program for three weeks.\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#History\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">History</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#2006_budget_cuts_and_changes_in_funding\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">2006 budget cuts and changes in funding</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Reductions_in_programs\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Reductions in programs</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Admission\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Admission</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Curriculum\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Curriculum</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#Notable_alumni\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Notable alumni</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#Governor&#39;s_School_of_Public_Issues\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Governor's School of Public Issues</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#Governor&#39;s_School_in_the_Sciences\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Governor's School in the Sciences</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-9\"><a href=\"#Governor&#39;s_School_of_the_Arts\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Governor's School of the Arts</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-10\"><a href=\"#Representation_in_other_media\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Representation in other media</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-11\"><a href=\"#See_also\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">See also</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-12\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">7</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-13\"><a href=\"#External_links\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">8</span> <span class=\"toctext\">External links</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"History\">History</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Governor%27s_School_of_New_Jersey&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: History\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The Governor's School was chartered by <a href=\"/wiki/Governor_of_New_Jersey\" title=\"Governor of New Jersey\">Governor of New Jersey</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Thomas_Kean\" title=\"Thomas Kean\">Thomas Kean</a> in 1983. The first school, School of Public Issues-<a href=\"/wiki/Monmouth_University\" title=\"Monmouth University\">Monmouth University</a>, began with 113 students. In 1984, two additional programs were added, School in the Sciences-<a href=\"/wiki/Drew_University\" title=\"Drew University\">Drew University</a>, and School of the Arts-<a href=\"/wiki/The_College_of_New_Jersey\" title=\"The College of New Jersey\">The College of New Jersey</a>. Each program accepted 100 students. In 1989, School on the Environment-<a href=\"/wiki/Stockton_University\" title=\"Stockton University\">Richard Stockton College of New Jersey</a> was added with an additional 100 students.\n</p><p>The Governor's School on International Studies at <a href=\"/wiki/Ramapo_College\" title=\"Ramapo College\">Ramapo College</a> began in July 2000, and the School of Engineering and Technology, housed on the Busch Campus of <a href=\"/wiki/Rutgers_University\" title=\"Rutgers University\">Rutgers University</a>, was established in July 2001.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"2006_budget_cuts_and_changes_in_funding\">2006 budget cuts and changes in funding</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Governor%27s_School_of_New_Jersey&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: 2006 budget cuts and changes in funding\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>From inception in 1983 through 2006, the School had been free-of-charge.  By 2006, the School had grown to serve more than 600 students per year.  To help control the 2006 budget, Governor <a href=\"/wiki/Jon_Corzine\" title=\"Jon Corzine\">Jon Corzine</a> proposed cuts to several education programs. He eliminated the entire $1.9mm allocated to the Governor's School.\n</p><p>Alumni, parents, faculty and others who realized the value of the program, however, organized fundraising in order for the 2006 Schools to be held. They were funded entirely with private contributions. On September 22, 2006, the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Star-Ledger\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Star-Ledger\">Star-Ledger</a></i> reported that Gov. Corzine signed Executive Order 35 (2006) to continue the Governor's School of New Jersey as a privately funded, tuition-based program.\n</p><p>In 2007, the state funded $100,000, or approximately 6% of the total budget of the program. Due to limited financial resources, the program was shorter and admitted fewer scholars than in 2008.\n</p><p>On July 20, 2006, the Governor's School for International Studies was cancelled due to an outbreak of <a href=\"/wiki/Whooping_cough\" title=\"Whooping cough\">whooping cough</a> among the students.
