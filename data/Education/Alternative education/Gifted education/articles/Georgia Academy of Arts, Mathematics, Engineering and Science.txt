The Georgia Academy of Arts, Mathematics, Engineering and Sciences, (formerly known as the Georgia Academy of Mathematics, Engineering and Science or GAMES), is an early college entrance program created in 1997 and facilitated by the University System of Georgia.  Typically, juniors or seniors in high school who meet or exceed the base requirements of GPA and SAT scores may apply and be admitted to the two-year program which is located at the Cochran, Georgia campus of Middle Georgia State University.  Students at The Georgia Academy receive college-level education with specialization in the fields of the arts, mathematics, engineering and science.  Students live in residence halls located on the Middle Georgia State University campus in Cochran, interact with faculty, and are given similar status to traditional students within the university.  Once students complete the program, they are awarded associate's degrees as well as high school diplomas from their former high schools, and enter a four-year college or university with a junior standing.
