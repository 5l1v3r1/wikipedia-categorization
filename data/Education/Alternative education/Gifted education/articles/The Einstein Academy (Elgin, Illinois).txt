The Einstein Academy is a small, private school for talented and gifted students in Pre-kindergarten through High school. The academy is registered as a 501(c)(3) Nonprofit organization in Elgin, Illinois, and is accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools.  While learning together for most subjects, students progress at their own level and pace in mathematics and Latin. Class sizes are limited to 12 students so teachers can give individualized attention. Hands-on activities and field trips are emphasized to supplement the curriculum.  The school has affiliations with the Illinois Association for Gifted Children, College Board, and the National Honor Society. The Einstein Academy is situated in two buildings on a campus that includes a soccer field and playground. One building houses the Elementary School, library/computer lab, and academy offices. The other features High school and Middle school classrooms, a science lab, gymnasium, and cafeteria.  The five-acre property backs up to Tyler Creek Forest Preserve, providing an outdoor classroom for environmental education. http://www.kaneforest.com/ Admission is offered to high achieving students and other gifted students whose potential may not be reflected in their grade point averages. Students generally must rank at least at the 80th percentile on standardized test scores to be admitted. The sports program allows middle school boys and girls to compete against neighboring schools in basketball, volleyball, soccer, and swimming. Athletes at The Einstein Academy are known as the Panthers. Coordinates: 42°04′00″N 88°17′54″W﻿ / ﻿42.066752°N 88.298218°W﻿ / 42.066752; -88.298218
