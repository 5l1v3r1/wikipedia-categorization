The goal of the program is to provide the framework within which students can explore the abstract, spatial, social, cultural and environmental concepts that affect the built environment while arriving at architectural solutions in a design studio setting. Design thinking is approached through a series of projects which include writing, drawing, and model-building exercises as part of an iterative design development process. The projects are supplemented with lectures, walking tours and field trips, allowing students to observe the built environment and study what has been done before in relation to the work they are doing.\n</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Creative_writing\" title=\"Creative writing\">Creative Writing</a></li></ul>\n<p>Students in the creative writing program receive intense individualized and small group instruction in all aspects of writing, from the formulation of ideas to revising, publishing, and performing.
