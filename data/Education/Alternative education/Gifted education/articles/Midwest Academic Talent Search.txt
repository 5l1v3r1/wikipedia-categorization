The Midwest Academic Talent Search, run by Northwestern University's Center for Talent Development in Chicago, Illinois gives above-level testing to gifted children grades 3-9 in the Midwest region to measure their ability and giftedness. 3rd to 6th graders can receive the EXPLORE test, while 6th to 9th graders can receive the ACT and/or the SAT. Students with qualifying scores are invited to CTD programs and receive planning materials from Northwestern in 10th grade. See also: Talent Identification Program.
