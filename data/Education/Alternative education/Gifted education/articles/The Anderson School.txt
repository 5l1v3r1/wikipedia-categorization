The Anderson School PS 334 is a New York City school for gifted children in grades kindergarten through 8 from the city's five boroughs.  It was founded thirty-one years ago (September 1987) as The Anderson Program under the stewardship of PS 9.  The New York City Department of Education (DOE) spun off Anderson in July 2005 as a stand-alone school — PS 334. Anderson's enrollment for the 2017-18 school year was 536 students.   Since inception, Anderson has had two sections (classrooms) per grade. The Anderson School (PS 334) inherited its name from its former parent school, the Sarah Anderson School,  a K-5 neighborhood catchment school that offers two programs: Renaissance and Gifted and Talented.  Until PS 334 moved to 100 West 77th Street in July 2009, both schools shared a building at 100 West 84th Street. Sarah Anderson (1922–1981)  was a beloved school paraprofessional.  The school community petitioned the Board of Education to rename PS 9 in her honor.  It became official during her memorial dedication in May 1981.   Never married, she was the mother of three:  Clarence "Pete" Anderson (1938 and living in East New York, Brooklyn), Ronald ("Ronnie") Dean Anderson (b. 1939 Griffin GA – 2001 Griffin), and Thomas Anderson.  Sarah Anderson is buried at Mount Pleasant Baptist Church Cemetery, Griffin, GA.  Her nickname, for those close to her, was "Peggy."  Her daughter-in-law (Clarence's wife), Earnestine Anderson, also worked with Sarah as a paraprofessional at PS 9.  Earnestine resides in Griffin. In 1993, under Principal Joan Gutkin, PhD (1936–1997), PS 9 (then the host school for The Anderson Program) received magnet school funding for music and art and henceforth adopted the name, "Renaissance School of Music and Art."  Ever since, PS 9 has used both names.
