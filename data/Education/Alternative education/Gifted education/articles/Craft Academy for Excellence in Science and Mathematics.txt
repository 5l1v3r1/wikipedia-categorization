The Craft Academy for Excellence in Science and Mathematics (simply Craft Academy) is a two-year residential early college high school serving approximately 120 high school juniors and seniors at Morehead State University. Students take MSU classes during their time at the Academy and graduate with a Craft Academy high school diploma as well as up to 60 hours of MSU college credit.  The Academy is supported by a public-private partnership between coal magnate Joe Craft and the State of Kentucky. Craft’s initial $4 million pledge in support of the Academy was the single largest cash gift in the history of MSU.  The first graduating Class of 2017 included 55 students. The Academy admits 60 students each year.
