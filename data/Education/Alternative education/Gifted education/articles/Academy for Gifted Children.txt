The Academy for Gifted Children is a non-denominational elementary and high school in Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada (12 Bond Cres).  Entrance is by a competitive examination.  The school has been designed to support intellectually gifted children, and it allows children from grades 1 to 12 to enter. The Academy for Gifted Children has made a modification to the usual system that Canadian public schools usually use.  Rather than simply allowing the students to proceed through grades 1 to 12, the Academy has merged grades 7 and 8 into one year, as well as added an extra year after grade 12.  This is to allow students to graduate with significantly more credits than those graduating from public school; however, the students graduating from P.A.C.E. still graduate at the same age. Attending students have the option of selecting from a variety extra-curricular activities the school has to offer outside of regular school hours. The Academy for Gifted Children, also known as P.A.C.E. (Programming for Academic and Creative Excellence), was founded in 1993 by former Earl Haig Secondary School teachers Dennis Reynolds & Barbara Rosenberg, and has increased in admission since its inception. The current school grounds was the former location of the Our Lady of the Annunciation Elementary School which moved to its new location east of Yonge Street in the early 1990s.
