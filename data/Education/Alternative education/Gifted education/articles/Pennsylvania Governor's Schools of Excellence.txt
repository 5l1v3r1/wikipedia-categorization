The Pennsylvania Governor's Schools of Excellence (PGSE) are five-week, publicly funded summer program for gifted high school students. Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell cut funding for the PGSE program in the state's 2009-2010 budget.    Five of the programs have been privately revived and are functioning members of the National Conference of Governor's Schools as of 2014.
