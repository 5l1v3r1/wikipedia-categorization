The program traditionally accepted students during their <a href=\"/wiki/High_school_junior\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"High school junior\">high school junior</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/High_school_senior\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"High school senior\">high school senior</a> years, though younger students considered to be exceptionally gifted have been accepted.\n</p><p>While enrolled, students were free to pursue whatever discipline they wanted, provided they met the credit requirements for graduation at their high-school.  Because of changes to the College Credit Now program, one 3-4 credit hour college class \"counts\" as a full unit of high school credit.  Therefore, students earned a full year of high school credit in one semester at the college level.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Student_life\">Student life</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Advanced_Academy_of_Georgia&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Student life\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Students were housed in Gunn Hall, a residence hall on the south-eastern corner of campus.  Previously housing both young Academy students and typical college-aged <a href=\"/wiki/Dean%27s_list\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Dean&#39;s list\">honors students</a>, Gunn Hall was for a time dedicated solely for housing Academy students and support staff, but since Fall 2014 has reverted to one wing of the building.\n</p><p>Since the students were housed together, they often formed strong relationships during their time in the program. The administration of the program encouraged this sense of community, providing activities such as Thursday Night Dinner, at which guests came and spoke to the students of the Academy on a variety of subjects, and regular events in Gunn Hall and around the campus specifically for the Academy students.\n</p><p>Several events for Academy students became yearly traditions.  Among these were \"Formal\" (a <a href=\"/wiki/Prom\" title=\"Prom\">prom</a>), a collaborative poetry and music performance called \"Coffee House\", and \"The Decathlon\".  The last of these was a very significant event for many current and former Academy students, in which two teams drawn up from both current students and alumni competed against each other in many different events, which included sports, <a href=\"/wiki/Board_games\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Board games\">board games</a>, a <a href=\"/wiki/Scavenger_hunt\" title=\"Scavenger hunt\">scavenger hunt</a>, and an <a href=\"/wiki/Engineering\" title=\"Engineering\">engineering</a> contest, known as the \"Challenge.\" The Decathlon would tend to inspire a great deal of camaraderie among the residents of a floor, while creating drama and competition between the floors as a whole. The Decathlon always took place on the weekend immediately preceding <a href=\"/wiki/Martin_Luther_King,_Jr._Day\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Martin Luther King, Jr. Day\">Martin Luther King, Jr. Day</a> in January and served as a time of reunion for former students and housing staff, who often came and stayed in Gunn Hall for the weekend and participated alongside current students in the competitions.\n</p><p>Academy students were allowed to participate in any extracurricular clubs or activities on campus except for social fraternities and <a href=\"/wiki/NCAA\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"NCAA\">NCAA</a> athletic teams. Advanced Academy students have, at various times, headed the school's robotics laboratory, intercollegiate mock trial team, Catholic Life Society, Asian Student Association, and the student <a href=\"/wiki/LGBT\" title=\"LGBT\">LGBT</a> support group, Lambda.  Past students have gone on to take professional or leadership roles in the West Georgia community, including the roles of student newspaper editor, Housing and Residence Life staff, and Honors College staff.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Changes_for_the_2016-2017_Academic_Year\">Changes for the 2016-2017 Academic Year</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Advanced_Academy_of_Georgia&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Changes for the 2016-2017 Academic Year\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>As the program was phased out in 2017, the Advanced Academy faced many changes in preparation for its discontinuation. Instead of accepting new residential students, the program only accepted new students who planned to commute to the school. The students who were returning from the 2015-2016 year (which included 2 international students) still planned to finish their high school education in the residential program, and were accommodated at the Oaks residence hall instead of their usual location at Gunn hall. The juniors during the 2016-2017 academic year, as they commuted to the campus anyway, were transferred to the school's normal dual-enrollment program for the following year. The 2016-2017 academic year also saw the removal of many events and practices designed to build community among academy students, including mandatory Thursday Night Dinners and Decathlon. The blue and green books, which were designed to ensure that the staff knew the location of each student and if they were in the residence hall for the night, became impractical and were replaced with an online form. The director at the time, Adriana Stanley, left in March, 2017 and was replaced by Kate Theobald as the interim director until the program was scheduled to end in May, 2017.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Notable_alumni\">Notable alumni</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Advanced_Academy_of_Georgia&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Notable alumni\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Over 750 students have attended The Advanced Academy of Georgia since its inception in the Fall Semester of 1995.
