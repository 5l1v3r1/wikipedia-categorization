Boston University Academy (BUA) is a private high school operated by Boston University.  Founded in 1993 and located on the Boston University campus, the Academy is geared toward college preparatory work.  As part of its integration with the university, students are able to take college courses for credit their junior and senior years, and are guaranteed acceptance to Boston University upon maintaining a 3.0 grade point average in Boston University courses. BUA's student body is drawn from 62 communities. 47% come from public schools, 42% from independent schools, 4% from parochial schools and 7% are from home schools or international schools. 50% are students of color and 46% of students come from multilingual households (representing 25 languages). BUA provides need-based tuition assistance to approximately 33% of the students as of the 2017–2018 academic year.  BU Academy student SAT scores  are consistently high: Its reported average SAT score in 2013 of 2148 was among the highest of any public or private high school in Massachusetts.  Nearly 100% (38 of 39 members) of its graduating class of 2012 were National Merit Commended Scholars.  (National Merit Commended Scholars generally score in the top 2% of all PSAT/NMSQT test-takers.) The focus of the school, however, is not on standardized test taking or college admission. Rather, the school seeks to introduce its students to the rich western tradition while giving a solid background in academics. The Academy is accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges and is a member of both the Secondary School Admission Test Board and the Association of Independent Schools of New England.  Boston University Academy was proposed and founded in 1993 by Peter Schweich,   then the vice president of Boston University, and authorized by John Silber,  then the president of Boston University. Peter Schweich was its first headmaster, and served in that role until 1999, when he was succeeded by Dr. Jennifer Bond Hickman. Dr. James Tracy replaced Hickman and served until the spring of 2006, when he was replaced by James Berkman. On August 21, 2014, Berkman announced that he would retire after the 2014–2015 academic year. On November 14, 2014, Provost Jean Morrison announced the appointment of Dr. Ari Betof to replace Berkman effective July 1, 2015. On July 10, 2018, Boston University announced the departure of Dr. Betof following an allegation of sexual misconduct.  Following his departure, Dr. Rosemary White succeeded him as interim head of school, effective immediately.  When BU Academy was founded, it covered grades 9-12; an 8th grade of approximately 20 students was added in 1999. The 8th grade was dropped in 2005. Tuition and fees for 2017-2018 is $43,130. Thirty-two percent of students receive need based financial aid. The average financial aid award is $26,778. Financial aid awards range from $3,130-$42,480. The average income of families that receive financial aid is $152,521.  Coordinates: 42°21′03″N 71°06′35″W﻿ / ﻿42.350956°N 71.10982°W﻿ / 42.350956; -71.10982
