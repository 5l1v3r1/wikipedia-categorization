The Johns Hopkins Center for Talented Youth (CTY) is a gifted education program for school-age children founded in 1979 by psychologist Julian Stanley at Johns Hopkins University. It was established as a research study into how academically advanced children learn, and became the first program to identify academically talented students through above-grade-level testing and provide them with challenging learning opportunities. CTY offers summer, online, and family programs to students from around the world and has nearly 30,000 program enrollments annually. CTY is accredited for students in grades K to 12 by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools. CTY publishes Imagine magazine that provides educational opportunities and resources and student-written content to middle and high school students. It is published by CTY five times per year. CTY executive director Elaine Tuttle Hansen is an advocate for educating bright students. She has been interviewed by National Public Radio and published on the Opinion-Editorial pages of The Chronicle of Higher Education, The New York Times, and The Baltimore Sun. CTY was featured in a July 2004 article in The New Yorker magazine entitled "Nerd Camp". CTY was shown in an hour-long CNN special on gifted children in 2006.  Notable CTY alumni include:
