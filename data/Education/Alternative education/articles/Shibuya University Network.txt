The Shibuya University Network (シブヤ大学, Shibuya daigaku), founded in 2006, is not a university or college in the traditional sense but a new system of education in the local community of Shibuya, Tokyo. The school is led by Yasuaki Sakyo, a 28-year-old ex-accountant.  There are no entrance examinations; classes take place in the city's surroundings; and teachers come from all walks of life.
