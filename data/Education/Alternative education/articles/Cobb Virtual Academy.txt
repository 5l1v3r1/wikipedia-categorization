Cobb Virtual Academy (CVA) is an online education program created and provided by the Cobb County School District in Georgia, United States. It is a separate entity from the Georgia Virtual School, an initiative by the Georgia Department of Education to provide online learning to students in public and private schools. Many students choose to take various courses provided by CVA to complete or add to their high school education. Students are expected to do relatively the same amount of work as in any offline course. Preliminary meetings, finals, and End of Course Tests are all done in person. Most assignments simply require composing a text document or completing a downloaded worksheet and emailing it to a teacher. While somewhat expensive, one or two of these classes may be taken during each of the normal school years with limited seats for each. There are currently 45 different classes available.
