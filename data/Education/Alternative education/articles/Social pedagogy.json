In many countries across Europe (and increasingly beyond), it has a long-standing tradition as a field of practice and academic discipline concerned with addressing <a href=\"/wiki/Social_inequality\" title=\"Social inequality\">social inequality</a> and facilitating social change by nurturing learning, well-being and connection both at an individual and community level. The term 'pedagogy' originates from the Greek <i>pais</i> (child) and <i>agein</i> (to bring up, or lead), with the prefix 'social' emphasising that upbringing is not only the responsibility of parents but a shared responsibility of society. Social pedagogy has therefore evolved in somewhat different ways in different countries and reflects cultural and societal norms, attitudes and notions of education and upbringing, of the relationship between the individual and society, and of social welfare provision for its marginalised members. Social pedagogues (professionals who have completed a qualification in social pedagogy) work within a range of different settings, from early years through adulthood to working with disadvantaged adult groups as well as older people. To achieve a holistic perspective within each of these settings, social pedagogy draws together theories and concepts from related disciplines such as <a href=\"/wiki/Sociology\" title=\"Sociology\">sociology</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Psychology\" title=\"Psychology\">psychology</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Education\" title=\"Education\">education</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Philosophy\" title=\"Philosophy\">philosophy</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Medical_sciences\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Medical sciences\">medical sciences</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Social_work\" title=\"Social work\">social work</a>.\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Methods\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Methods</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Principles\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Principles</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Historic_development\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Historic development</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Jean-Jacques_Rousseau\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Johann_Heinrich_Pestalozzi\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#New_Education_Movement\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">New Education Movement</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#Alleviating_poverty\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Alleviating poverty</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#Social_pedagogy\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Social pedagogy</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-9\"><a href=\"#Qualifying_as_a_social_pedagogue\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Qualifying as a social pedagogue</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-10\"><a href=\"#Germany\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Germany</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-11\"><a href=\"#Denmark\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Denmark</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-12\"><a href=\"#Czech_Republic_and_Slovakia\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Czech Republic and Slovakia</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-13\"><a href=\"#North_America\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">North America</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-14\"><a href=\"#United_Kingdom\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">United Kingdom</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-15\"><a href=\"#See_also\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">See also</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-16\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-17\"><a href=\"#Further_reading\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">7</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Further reading</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-18\"><a href=\"#Further_information\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">8</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Further information</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Methods\">Methods</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Social_pedagogy&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Methods\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen<sup id=\"cite_ref-juhu_1-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-juhu-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> points out that social pedagogy is not a method or a set of methods, but that any method is chosen based on social pedagogical considerations.

Concerned with the decay of society, he developed his theories based on his belief that human beings were inherently good as they were closest to nature when born, but society and its institutions corrupted them and denaturalized them.  Consequently, bringing up children in harmony with nature and its laws so as to preserve the good was central for Rousseau\u2019s pedagogic theory.  Rousseau innovatively \u201cargued that the momentum for learning was provided by the growth of the person (nature) \u2013 and that what the educator needed to do was to facilitate opportunities for learning,\u201d as Doyle and Smith<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> note.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Johann_Heinrich_Pestalozzi\">Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Social_pedagogy&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Rousseau\u2019s educational philosophy inspired ensuing pedagogues, notably <a href=\"/wiki/Johann_Heinrich_Pestalozzi\" title=\"Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi\">Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi</a> (1746\u20131827), who refined Rousseau\u2019s thoughts by developing a method of holistic education, which addressed head, heart, and hands.  These three elements are inseparable from each other in Pestalozzi\u2019s method and need to be kept in harmony.  \"Nature forms the child as an indivisible whole, as a vital organic unity with many sided moral, mental, and physical capacities.  Each of these capacities is developed through and by means of the others,\" Pestalozzi stated.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"New_Education_Movement\">New Education Movement</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Social_pedagogy&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: New Education Movement\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Pestalozzi\u2019s ideas sparked interest across continental Europe, and particularly the <a href=\"/wiki/New_Education_Movement\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"New Education Movement\">New Education Movement</a> transferred his pedagogic concept into various settings, such as kindergarten (<a href=\"/wiki/Fr%C3%B6bel,_Friedrich\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Fr\u00f6bel, Friedrich\">Fr\u00f6bel</a>), school (<a href=\"/wiki/Montessori,_Maria\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Montessori, Maria\">Montessori</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Steiner,_Rudolf\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Steiner, Rudolf\">Steiner</a>, Hahn), residential care (<a href=\"/wiki/Korczak,_Janusz\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Korczak, Janusz\">Korczak</a>), and informal work with children and young people (Montessori).  Thus the New Education Movement contributed to a continental pedagogic discourse, which saw children being conceptualised as equal human beings (\"Children do not become humans, they already are\", Korczak), and as competent, active agents (\"A child has a hundred languages\", Malaguzzi).  Furthermore, there was increasing recognition for child participation and children\u2019s rights, for instance in the pedagogic concepts of Montessori and Korczak.<br />\nThe New Education Movement led to a spread of pedagogic concepts and ideas across many European countries and made two fundamental points which demonstrate its ambition to use pedagogy for social change: \u201cFirst, in all education the personality of the child is an essential concern; second, education must make for human betterment, that is for a New Era\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Alleviating_poverty\">Alleviating poverty</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Social_pedagogy&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Alleviating poverty\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Based on the educational ideas of Rousseau, Pestalozzi and Fr\u00f6bel, the German headteacher <a href=\"/wiki/Friedrich_Diesterweg\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Friedrich Diesterweg\">Friedrich Diesterweg</a> (1790\u20141866) emphasised the social relevance of pedagogy in fighting social inequalities.

Pedagogic thinkers like Pestalozzi and later on Montessori followed in his tradition of developing a child-centred pedagogy, which was increasingly criticised by an emerging school of thought that promoted a pedagogy focused on the collective, on the community and how to use pedagogic ideas for social betterment \u2013 or a social pedagogy, as the German educationalist <a href=\"/wiki/Karl_Mager\" title=\"Karl Mager\">Karl Mager</a> had written in 1844 for the first time.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Social_pedagogy\">Social pedagogy</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Social_pedagogy&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Social pedagogy\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>One of the first key thinkers, <a href=\"/wiki/Paul_Natorp\" title=\"Paul Natorp\">Paul Natorp</a>, \u201cclaimed that all pedagogy should be social, that is, that in the philosophy of education the interaction of educational processes and society must be taken into consideration\u201d,.<sup id=\"cite_ref-juhu_1-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-juhu-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> His social pedagogic theories were influenced by <a href=\"/wiki/Plato\" title=\"Plato\">Plato</a>\u2019s doctrine of ideas, together with <a href=\"/wiki/Immanuel_Kant\" title=\"Immanuel Kant\">Immanuel Kant</a>\u2019s <a href=\"/wiki/Categorical_imperative\" title=\"Categorical imperative\">categorical imperative</a> of treating people as subjects in their own rights instead of treating them as means to an end, and Pestalozzi\u2019s method. <br />\nIn the 1920s, with influential educationalists such as Herman Nohl, German social pedagogy was interpreted from a hermeneutical perspective, which acknowledged that an individual\u2019s life and their problems can only be understood through their eyes and in their social context, by understanding how the individual interacts with their social environment. <br />\nFollowing World War II and the experiences within National Socialism that exposed the dangers of collective education in the hands of a totalitarian state, social pedagogy \u201cbecame more critical, revealing a critical attitude towards society and taking the structural factors of society that produce social suffering into consideration\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-juhu_1-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-juhu-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> Consequently, contemporary social pedagogy in Germany is as a discipline linked more closely to social work and sociology than to psychology.<br />\nDue to different historical developments and cultural notions, social pedagogy has very different traditions in other countries, although these are connected through the overarching core principles of social pedagogy. And even within one country, there is not the pedagogic approach \u2013 within the general discipline pedagogy we can distinguish various approaches. Some of these are named after key thinkers like Fr\u00f6bel or Montessori who have created a very specific pedagogic concept for the context of their work, while others are termed according to the medium they are utilising, such as adventure, play, circus, music, or <a href=\"/wiki/Theatre_pedagogy\" title=\"Theatre pedagogy\">theatre pedagogy</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Qualifying_as_a_social_pedagogue\">Qualifying as a social pedagogue</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Social_pedagogy&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: Qualifying as a social pedagogue\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Similar to other academic disciplines, social pedagogy is a degree-level qualification (higher education) of usually 3.5 years.
