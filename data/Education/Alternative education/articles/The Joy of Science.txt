 The Joy of Science is a popular video and audio course series, consisting of 60 lectures, each 30 minutes long, presented by Dr. Robert Hazen of the George Mason University and the Carnegie Institution of Washington. The course, first introduced in 2001, is part of The Great Courses (TGC) series, and is produced and distributed by The Teaching Company (TTC), located in Chantilly, Virginia in the United States.        As the Clarence B. Robinson Professor at George Mason University, Robert Hazen developed innovative courses to promote scientific literacy in both scientists and non-scientists.  In a collaboration with physicist James Trefil, he wrote three undergraduate textbooks: The Sciences: An Integrated Approach (1993),  The Physical Sciences: An Integrated Approach (1995),  and Physics Matters: An Introduction to Conceptual Physics (2004).  Hazen used these as the basis for a 60-lecture video and audio course called The Joy of Science.
