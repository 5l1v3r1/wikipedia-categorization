  Alia College is an independent co-educational secondary school in Hawthorn East, Victoria, Australia. Advertising itself as a "non rule-based school",  Alia College does not have a school uniform, allows its students to leave the school premises and does not impose any formal punishments such as detentions. Despite this unorthodox approach, however, Alia teaches a standard curriculum, with Latin being a compulsory subject (7-9).   In 2007, after the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal's finding that the school had an "anarchistic nature", Education Minister John Lenders initiated an inquiry into the school.  On its website, Alia denies this, stating that "‘Open and fair minded’ would be a better description. But our approach might seem 'anarchistic' when people hear of our "no rules" approach."  In 2013, Alia College was in the top five schools by Year 9 NAPLAN results in the Reading, Spelling, and Grammar and Punctuation categories.
