Bassick High School is a US public high school located in Bridgeport, Connecticut. In 1924, the Bassick family home was demolished to begin construction for a school. The E & F Construction Company was awarded the contract after submitting a bid for $692,946. Architect Ernest G. Southey created a Georgian style plan set back 100 feet from Fairfield Avenue leaving "ample room to the south of the school for a large athletic field." Bassick Junior High School opened in 1929 with 1,034 students in grades seven through nine and was soon thereafter converted to a senior high school. A new addition was built in 1968 at a cost of $3.5 million.  As of 2006, the school administration planned to continue developing "Achievement and Career Academies" within the school. "These Academies will create small communities of learners that will personalize the educational experience for each student and provide needed support for increased levels of academic achievement," according to the Federal Department of Education Web site. "Through an Advisory Program, Bassick will ensure that each student is known well by at least one adult member of the school community." The program was also to integrate reading and mathematics instruction.  In the federal 2006 fiscal year, The U.S. Department of Education awarded the school $476,753 for a five-year "Smaller Learning Communities" grant.  The school is former member of the FCIAC conference, having departed for the Constitution State Conference in 2015.  Bassick High School offers various athletic teams for both boys and girls.  The Bassick Lions compete in football, soccer, cross country, track, basketball, volleyball, baseball, and softball, and there is also an active cheer squad, the Lionettes.  Bassick's basketball team boasts several great successes, including the 1940 and 1989 Connecticut state championships,  and three more finals appearances, in 1939, 2000 and 2004.   More recently, the team qualified for the semifinals of the 2015 Connecticut state championship, before losing to Bunnell High School of Stratford.
