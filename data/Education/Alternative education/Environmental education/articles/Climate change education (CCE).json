It is grounded in the holistic approach of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) which incorporates key sustainable development issues such as climate change, <a href=\"/wiki/Disaster_risk_reduction\" title=\"Disaster risk reduction\">disaster risk reduction</a> and others into education, in a way that addresses the interdependence of environmental sustainability, economic viability and social justice. It promotes participatory teaching and learning methods that motivate and empower learners to change their behaviour and take action for sustainable development. The programme seeks to help people understand the impact of global warming today and increase \u2018climate literacy\u2019, especially among young people, and aims to make education a more central part of the international response to climate change. UNESCO works with national governments to integrate CCE into national <a href=\"/wiki/Curriculum\" title=\"Curriculum\">curricula</a> and to develop innovative teaching and learning approaches for doing so.<sup id=\"cite_ref-:0_1-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:0-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Selected_country_profiles_regarding_CCE_and_ESD\">Selected country profiles regarding CCE and ESD</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Climate_change_education_(CCE)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Selected country profiles regarding CCE and ESD\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Australia\">Australia</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Climate_change_education_(CCE)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Australia\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Australia has been at the forefront of <a href=\"/wiki/Education_for_sustainable_development\" title=\"Education for sustainable development\">education for sustainability</a>, adopting in 2000 a national plan entitled Environmental Education for a Sustainable Future. A number of initiatives and bodies were created to implement the national plan, including the Australian Sustainable Schools Initiative and <a href=\"/wiki/Australian_Research_Institute_for_Environment_and_Sustainability\" title=\"Australian Research Institute for Environment and Sustainability\">Australian Research Institute for Environment and Sustainability</a>. These provided a strong foundation for Australia\u2019s strategy, launched in 2006, to respond to the <a href=\"/wiki/Education_for_sustainable_development#United_Nations_Decade_of_Education_for_Sustainable_Development_.28DESD.29\" title=\"Education for sustainable development\">UN Decade of Education for Sustainable Development</a>. The strategy set out the goal to mainstream sustainability through a holistic approach that engages the community through education and <a href=\"/wiki/Lifelong_learning\" title=\"Lifelong learning\">lifelong learning</a>. Whereas climate change was referred to as one of a number of environmental concerns in the first national plan, a new plan launched in 2009, entitled Living Sustainably: the Australian Government\u2019s National Action Plan for Education for Sustainability, had a greater focus on climate change and its impacts on other natural resources within a wider global context. The new plan incorporated climate change within education for sustainability, rather than establishing a new and potentially competing field of Climate Change Education. Australia introduced its first-ever national curriculum in 2014, including sustainability as one of three cross-curriculum subjects.<sup id=\"cite_ref-:0_1-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:0-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Since 2009, Climate Change Education has been most evident in the <a href=\"/wiki/TVET_(Technical_and_Vocational_Education_and_Training)\" title=\"TVET (Technical and Vocational Education and Training)\">VET sector</a>. <a href=\"/wiki/Council_of_Australian_Governments\" title=\"Council of Australian Governments\">COAG</a> endorsed the Green Skills Agreement in 2009, and the Ministerial Council for Vocational and Technical Education published the National VET Sector Sustainability Policy and Action Plan (2009-2012). These initiatives aimed to provide workers with the skills needed to transition to a low-carbon economy and VET teachers with suitable training packages to promote education for sustainability.<sup id=\"cite_ref-:0_1-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:0-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"China\">China</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Climate_change_education_(CCE)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: China\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>China introduced <a href=\"/wiki/Environmental_education\" title=\"Environmental education\">environmental education</a> in the late 1970s as a result of increased attention to sustainable development and the need to protect the environment. Following the <a href=\"/wiki/Earth_Summit\" title=\"Earth Summit\">United Nations Conference on Environment and Development</a> (Rio de Janeiro, 1992), environmental education moved towards environment, population and development, and finally education for sustainable development.<sup id=\"cite_ref-:0_1-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:0-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The Chinese government has produced a number of policy documents identifying environmental education and ESD as key to quality education. In 2003, the Ministry of Education issued the first guiding policy - the Guidelines for Implementing Environmental Education in Elementary and Secondary School - on environmental education in China. ESD was formally incorporated into the national education policy in 2010 in The National Education Outline 2010-2020, and further integrated in some local education policies. National climate change policies and plans in China refer to education but do not specifically address CCE. This has resulted in limited institutional support to date. There is no national ESD or CCE action plan or official policy to inform its implementation.<sup id=\"cite_ref-:0_1-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:0-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In China, ESD mainly refers to providing individuals with the scientific knowledge, learning capacity, values and lifestyle choices to meet the country\u2019s sustainable development objectives. CCE is most commonly implemented as a component of ESD. A number of educational approaches have been adopted to facilitate the implementation of ESD. These include integrating ESD values into school philosophy, <a href=\"/wiki/Curriculum_development\" title=\"Curriculum development\">curriculum development</a>, capacity-building of teachers and educators, ESD pedagogical approaches and ESD and CCE thematic activities.<sup id=\"cite_ref-:0_1-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:0-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>ESD is a component of compulsory education, but is limited in higher education, VET and adult education. The Ministry of Education has recently issued a guidance document that identified the VET sector in particular as needing to be reformed to meet the sustainable development objectives of the Chinese economy.<sup id=\"cite_ref-:0_1-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:0-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Denmark\">Denmark</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Climate_change_education_(CCE)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Denmark\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Denmark and its neighbouring countries began working together in the 1990s to formulate a policy for ESD. While Denmark signed the <a href=\"/wiki/United_Nations_Economic_Commission_for_Europe\" title=\"United Nations Economic Commission for Europe\">United Nations Economic Commission for Europe</a> (UNECE) declaration on ESD in 2005, it did not adopt a strategy until 2009, just before the half-way point of the DESD. The Ministry of Education, which was made responsible for the DESD, organised a consultation process on how to promote ESD before adopting its strategy in 2009.<sup id=\"cite_ref-:0_1-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:0-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The UN Climate Summit (COP15) held in Denmark in December 2009 provided the impetus to develop of a number of national ESD policy initiatives. A national strategy on ESD was developed with a substantial climate change component. The aim of the strategy is to make citizens more responsible for their actions by improving their scientific knowledge. The ESD strategy notes that climate change should not be the sole focus of ESD, though the concrete initiatives that are part of the strategy mostly support the CCE projects and activities that were part of COP15 preparations.<sup id=\"cite_ref-:0_1-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:0-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>A new national school curriculum adopted in 2009 included elements of ESD and CCE. The concept of sustainability was embedded in the goals describing the interrelationships between nature and society. CCE is mostly approached as teaching climate science, but it was also included in subjects such as geography and social studies, where the interrelationships between human behaviour, consumption and climate are examined.<sup id=\"cite_ref-:0_1-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:0-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>There has been no explicit policy change in the TVET sector to upgrade skills to respond to climate change and environmental issues. However, it is important to note that the Danish TVET sector had previously reflected skills related to ecological modernisation in areas such as energy generation, <a href=\"/wiki/Waste_management\" title=\"Waste management\">waste management</a> and agriculture. While the new government identified the economic and environmental climate change crises as important, education is only referred to in relation to the economic crisis. There is no mention of climate change or sustainability with regard to education, and the platform documentation on \u2018green transition\u2019 does not mention education. Overall, no policy strategy has been set to promote ESD, CCE, or the \u2018greening\u2019 of TVET as part of the government\u2019s sustainable development and climate change policies. Government initiatives support NGO-led projects to raise community awareness of climate change. A national network on ESD was established with funding through to 2013.<sup id=\"cite_ref-:0_1-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:0-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Dominican_Republic\">Dominican Republic</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Climate_change_education_(CCE)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Dominican Republic\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The Dominican Republic has taken a lead role in promoting ESD. Environmental education was made mandatory for all schools in 1998 and this has since evolved into ESD. In 2000, the General Law of Environment and Natural Resources changed the way environmental education was taught, moving from a subject matter to a cross-cutting and interdisciplinary theme. Risk management is also an important aspect of MINERD\u2019s strategic plan, and has been integrated into the school curriculum as a cross-cutting subject. In 2004, the Environmental Education Strategy for Sustainable Development was adopted, which fosters formal and non-formal ESD. It is based on constructivism and uses a variety of pedagogical techniques that promote participatory learning.<sup id=\"cite_ref-:0_1-14\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:0-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The Ten-year 2008-2018 Education Plan (PDE) addresses the issue of quality education, including sustainable development and a culture of peace. It also established a process for periodic review of the curriculum. Climate change is also being introduced into the curriculum. The National Teacher Training Institute (INAFOCAM) and the Salom\u00e9 Ure\u00f1a Higher Institute for Teacher Training (ISFODOSU) provide support for environmental education through teacher training and curriculum support.
