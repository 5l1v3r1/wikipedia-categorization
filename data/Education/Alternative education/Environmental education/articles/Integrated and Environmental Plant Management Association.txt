The Integrated and Environmental Plant Management Association (IEPMA) is mainly an educational association, with an annual conference held in January in Kelowna, British Columbia as one of its main focuses. The Conference draws participants from throughout British Columbia and Alberta–with speakers from government (municipal, provincial, and federal), universities, colleges, and industry. Participants in these conferences can gain CEC’s (Continuing Education Credits) toward renewal of the BC Pesticide Applicator Certificate. The IEPMA was originally constituted to represent professional pesticide applicators in British Columbia. Through the years, however, its membership has become more diverse, and now also includes landscape consultants and representatives from commercial nurseries, school districts, golf courses, and various departments of municipal governments. The forerunner of the IEPMA was the Environmental Standards Association, formed in 1983 in Kelowna. The association was reconstituted in Penticton, British Columbia in 1992 as the IEPMA, with Dudley Gordon as its first President.
