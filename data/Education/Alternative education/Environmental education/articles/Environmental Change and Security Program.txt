The Environmental Change and Security Program (ECSP) is one of several programs and projects that make up the Global Resilience and Sustainability Program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. ECSP was founded in 1994 to study the connections among environmental, health, and population dynamics and their links to conflict, human insecurity, and foreign policy.  ECSP holds events and publishes research and multimedia content with the aim of connecting scholars, policymakers, the media, and practitioners. The program currently has three primary topical focus areas:  ECSP produces a series of program reports as well as the FOCUS series of short briefs on integrated population, health, and environment programs.  Previous occasional publications include Navigating Peace: Forging New Water Partnerships and Water Stories: Expanding Opportunities in Small-Scale Water and Sanitation Projects. The program also maintains a daily blog, New Security Beat, and a YouTube channel with speaker interviews. ECSP is supported by grants from the U.S. Agency for International Development, under the Health, Environment, Livelihoods, Population, and Security (HELPS) Project and the Resources for Peace Project (RFPP).
