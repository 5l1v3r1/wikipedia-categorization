Young Irish Film Makers (YIFM) is a film training and production company set up in 1991 to help young people aged 13 to 20 make digital feature films. In 1998 they produced their first feature Under the Hawthorn Tree for Channel 4 and RTÃ‰. In 2002 YIFM set up the National Youth Film School to allow young people from all over Ireland and abroad to spend five weeks shooting a major feature film for television. Two films produced under the National Youth Film School, The Children (IMDB) and Stealaway (IMDB), have won awards at the Moondance International Film Festival.
