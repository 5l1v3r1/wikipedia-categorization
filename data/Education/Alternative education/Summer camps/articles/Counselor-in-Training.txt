Counselor-in-Training (CIT) at a summer camp can be both a personâ€™s designation and a program, intended to prepare people to become counselors. CIT programs vary in detail, but all have elements in common. In order to be an effective counselor, guidelines help maximize the training experience:  1. Prepare for the job; research and practice activities you are unfamiliar with including certification in First Aid/CPR. 2. Understand your responsibilities and embrace them. 3. Pay attention during training and ask questions. 4. Make friends with other staff, so everybody gets along. 5. Become familiar with camp support groups and what they do: kitchen, medical, maintenance, etc.  6. Memorize the daily schedule.  7. Learn and use the first names of those in your group. 8. Spend time with each team member and determine their personality type.   9. Teambuild before members compete against each other. 10. Get feedback from your team members daily and adjust subsequent activities.  11. Use your time wisely, especially free time.
