These holidays are called Superweeks.\n</p><p>ATE seeks to contribute to British children\u2019s education by providing opportunities to learn about themselves, other people and to discover new things about the world around them. By running Superweeks, ATE provides children with a safe, supportive environment away from the pressure of \u2018real life\u2019 in which they cultivate child focused holidays where days are play-packed and leave a child with memories that ATE believes are essential to a happy childhood. They achieve this by having a deep rooted, traceable history in education, and running unique intensive residential training courses for the volunteers who care for the children.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\"

Superweeks are residential holidays (at New Year, Easter and Summer) that take place in country houses and mansions at various locations around the United Kingdom. The holidays are designed for children aged 8 to 16 years and provide a period of fresh air, fun and communal living with other children from a wide variety of backgrounds and outlooks.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-telegraph_article_3-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-telegraph_article-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> All ATE Superweeks are accredited by YG&amp;T as <a href=\"/wiki/Young_Gifted_and_Talented_Programme\" title=\"Young Gifted and Talented Programme\">Young Gifted and Talented</a> provision.\n</p><p>ATE believes in a world where all children can feel safe, loved and supported and a world where all children have the opportunity to have real adventures. A safe place from which they can launch themselves into the unknown, whilst all the time discovering and learning ever more new things about themselves. ATE wants a world where life is not a series of things that have to be done, but of possibilities to savour, to have fun with and to remember forever. Children need to be exposed to situations from which they can go away with increased confidence and personal aspirations and, above all, where they can feel, and be, themselves.\n</p><p>More children need to play; play outside and with other people. There is an often heard complaint within our society that children are growing up too fast, so formal education needs to be complemented with imaginative, active interaction. Children need an environment in which they can explore their imaginations, the unrealistic and the still-fictional; a care free environment with limitless possibilities that encourages them to reach for the stars.\n</p><p>More children need happier childhood experiences and memories created with other children and other adults. ATE wants Britain\u2019s children to have increased, real experiences of positive social interaction with varied personalities. This will lead to better socially-educated young people, and an increased tolerance of others and a positive perspective of the world.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Children\">The Children</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Active_Training_and_Education_Trust&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: The Children\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Children come on Superweeks from all over the UK and some from beyond. They come from a wide range of socio-economic backgrounds, and although most are paid for in total by their family, a significant minority (about 15%) are sponsored either by ATE\u2019s own sponsorship fund or by other bodies such as the Social Services. They come to Superweeks to learn about the value of play and how to make new friends with children from a very wide range of backgrounds and with adults who are neither parents nor teachers.\n</p><p>Superweeks are designed to be accessible and enjoyable to children from all walks of life, regardless of their personal tastes. They do not focus excessively on physical or outdoor pursuits, but instead use a wide range of activities including games, singing, drama and handicraft as the framework for a happy and constructive experience of community living.<sup id=\"cite_ref-telegraph_article_3-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-telegraph_article-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> The organisation makes every effort to be inclusive and will accept children with special needs or behavioural difficulties whenever it seems reasonably clear that their attendance will be successful.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Key_people\">Key people</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Active_Training_and_Education_Trust&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Key people\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>ATE was founded by Chris Green, who was awarded the <a href=\"/wiki/Member_of_the_Order_of_the_British_Empire\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Member of the Order of the British Empire\">MBE</a> in the <a href=\"/wiki/2011_New_Year_Honours\" title=\"2011 New Year Honours\">New Year Honours List 2011</a> for services to education through ATE and summer camps.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> He had previously been involved in establishing and managing Colony Holidays (est. 1963), a provider of <a href=\"/wiki/Summer_camp#United_Kingdom\" title=\"Summer camp\">summer camps in the United Kingdom</a> from the 1960s to 1980s.

It was started with a launching grant from the then Ministry of Education, with a distinguished governing Council chaired by Sir John Wolfenden, and with Sir William Alexander as Secretary. In 1965 Chris Green and a colleague left teaching to work full-time for CCHS.\n</p><p>By the early seventies over 5000 children per annum were enjoying colony holidays during school vacations and half-terms.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Key_figures\">Key figures</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Active_Training_and_Education_Trust&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Key figures\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Sir John Wolfenden was succeeded as Chairman by Lord Hill of Luton, then by Lord Vaizey of Greenwich.

It collaborated with organisations such as the Puffin Club, the National Trust, the WRVS, Manchester University Settlement and Birmingham Settlement, to run special colony holidays for them. It helped set up Discovery Holidays in Northern Ireland which ran holidays for 1,000 or more children from all backgrounds in the province each year. It worked with the Union Fran\u00e7aise des Centres de Vacances to run Anglo-French holidays.

Colony Holidays attracted and kept the commitment and enthusiasm of many outstanding young educators, who believed deeply in what the organisation did and stood for. Many of these people have gone on to be successful Headteachers or to other positions of responsibility; they regularly attest how large a part their early training and experience of responsibility in the happy and relaxed context of a colony holiday has played in their development of management and personal skills.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Ethos\">Ethos</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Active_Training_and_Education_Trust&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10\" title=\"Edit section: Ethos\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<table class=\"plainlinks metadata ambox ambox-content ambox-Advert\" role=\"presentation\"><tbody><tr><td class=\"mbox-image\"><div style=\"width:52px\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Ambox_important.svg/40px-Ambox_important.svg.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Ambox_important.svg/60px-Ambox_important.svg.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Ambox_important.svg/80px-Ambox_important.svg.png 2x\" data-file-width=\"40\" data-file-height=\"40\" /></div></td><td class=\"mbox-text\"><div class=\"mbox-text-span\">This section <b>contains content that is written like <a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not#Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox_or_means_of_promotion\" title=\"Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not\">an advertisement</a></b>.<span class=\"hide-when-compact\"> Please help <a class=\"external text\" href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Active_Training_and_Education_Trust&amp;action=edit\">improve it</a> by removing <a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Spam\" title=\"Wikipedia:Spam\">promotional content</a> and inappropriate <a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:External_links\" title=\"Wikipedia:External links\">external links</a>, and by adding encyclopedic content written from a <a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view\" title=\"Wikipedia:Neutral point of view\">neutral point of view</a>.</span>  <small><i>(October 2017)</i></small><small class=\"hide-when-compact\"><i> (<a href=\"/wiki/Help:Maintenance_template_removal\" title=\"Help:Maintenance template removal\">Learn how and when to remove this template message</a>)</i></small></div></td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>Colony Holidays, like ATE its successor body, believed that a short period spent in a residential holiday, away from TV and computers, making friends with others from all backgrounds and many different schools, taking part in a varied programme of fun activities, and by the end feeling part of a happy family-like community, can offer to children the opportunity to gain in confidence and independence, to increase social skills, to discover new interests and talents, to make new friends, and above all to live some real childhood running about and playing in green fields and woods away from all the commercial aspects and pressures of their life back home.\n</p><p>Many people who attended Colony Holidays as children and / or as Monitors have said what a powerful influence the experience had on them. One woman, now a hospital nurse, who came to Colony Holidays regularly over seven or eight years, wrote recently to say \u201cthank you for the best 118 days of my childhood.\u201d\n</p><p>Colony Holidays was supported and admired by a large number of leading educationists, by many schools who invited CCHS to recruit children, and by many hundreds of parents who saw how much their children were gaining both in happiness and in personal growth.

This involves a further five-day residential training course and when an individual has successfully acted in this role on at least three occasions, they can be invited to train as a Director, another five-day residential course. The Director is responsible for all aspects of running a Superweek with up to 60 children and 25 staff. Most (but not all) ATE Directors are school teachers. ATE staff, like the children, come from all over the UK and some from other countries too.\n</p><p>The work of Monitors and Assistant Directors on Superweeks is voluntary; they only receive expenses and bed and board for the work they do.
