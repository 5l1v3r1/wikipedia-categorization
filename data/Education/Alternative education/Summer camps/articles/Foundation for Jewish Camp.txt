The Foundation for Jewish Camp (FJC), formerly known as the Foundation for Jewish Camping, is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit serving North America.  It serves as an advocate and resource for nonprofit Jewish camp professionals, lay leaders, families and others interested in the field.  FJC works with more than 150 camps, 70,000 campers, and 10,000 counselors to elevate the field of Jewish camp, conferring proper recognition and granting appropriate support to expand its impact across our community, so that camp can be a critical element of every Jewish young person's education. FJC provides a comprehensive website to serve families searching for Jewish camps as well as detail out the programs it runs. In 2008, the Overnight Camp Incentive Program provided grant money to 18 campers to attend Pinemere Camp. The program is a joint project of the Neubauer Family Foundation, the Foundation for Jewish Camp, and the Jewish Federation of Greater Philadelphia.     The grants ranged from $750 to $1,250.   The majority of the Pinemere campers who received grants chose to return the following summer.
