In 2015, the UK Government   rolled out the degree apprenticeship programme which was developed as part of the higher apprenticeship standard. The programme is the equivalent of a masters or bachelor's degree which offers a level 6 â€“ 7 qualification.  Training for this qualification includes working in a full-time job as well as studying at a partner University or training provider. Degree apprenticeships have been designed for learners 18 years of age or older. Candidates interested in this programme must already have a level-3 qualification such as an advanced apprenticeship, A levels or an International Baccalaureat. However, some programmes may require further training.
