After passage of the <a href=\"/wiki/National_Industrial_Recovery_Act\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"National Industrial Recovery Act\">National Industrial Recovery Act</a> (NIRA), industry, <a href=\"/wiki/Trade_unions\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Trade unions\">trade unions</a> and the <a href=\"/wiki/National_Recovery_Administration\" title=\"National Recovery Administration\">National Recovery Administration</a> cooperated to fashion various \"industry codes\" to govern competition, wages, working conditions and quality of products and services. One aspect of the general construction industry code was a set of rules regulating apprenticeship programs in the construction industry.\n</p><p>The NIRA was declared unconstitutional by the <a href=\"/wiki/United_States_Supreme_Court\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"United States Supreme Court\">United States Supreme Court</a> in May 1935.\n</p><p>To continue the work for the construction industry code authority in regard to apprenticeship programs, <a href=\"/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Labor\" title=\"United States Secretary of Labor\">United States Secretary of Labor</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Frances_Perkins\" title=\"Frances Perkins\">Frances Perkins</a> established the <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Federal_Committee_on_Apprenticeship&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Federal Committee on Apprenticeship (page does not exist)\">Federal Committee on Apprenticeship</a>. Composed of representatives from federal government agencies, Perkins tasked the committee to recommend federal policies regarding apprenticeships.\n</p><p>In 1937, the Congress passed the National Apprenticeship Act (29 U.S.C. 50), also known as \"the Fitzgerald Act.\" The Act established a national advisory committee whose task was to research and draft regulations to establish minimum standards for apprenticeship programs. The Act was later amended to permit the <a href=\"/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Labor\" title=\"United States Department of Labor\">United States Department of Labor</a> to issue regulations protecting the health, safety and general welfare of apprentices, and to encourage the use of contracts in the hiring and employment of them.\n</p><p>The Fitzgerald Act is administered by the Employment and Training Administration in the Department of Labor. The standards governing apprenticeship programs are located in the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations at Title 29, CFR Part 29.  Regulations banning racial, ethnic, religious, age and gender discrimination in apprenticeship programs are located at Title 29, CFR Part 30.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=National_Apprenticeship_Act&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.realapprenticeship.com/mcat/mainweb/apprenticeshiphist2.htm\">\"Apprenticeship history.\" Michigan Carpenter &amp; Millwright Apprenticeship Program. no date.</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"External_links\">External links</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=National_Apprenticeship_Act&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: External links\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.doleta.gov/oa/\">Office of Registered Apprenticeship, U.S. DOL</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.doleta.gov/OA/Original_fitzact_code.cfm\">Text of the original National Apprenticeship Act.</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.doleta.gov/\">Employment &amp; Training Administration, U.S. DOL</a></li></ul>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw2253\nCached time: 20180918222236\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.004 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.010 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 16/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 0/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:8993010-0!canonical and timestamp 20180918222236 and revision id 802420694\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","*":"1937_in_law"},{"sortkey":"","*":"75th_United_States_Congress"},{"sortkey":"","*":"United_States_federal_labor_legislation"},{"sortkey":"","hidden":"","*":"United_States_federal_legislation_articles_without_infoboxes"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Internships"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Apprenticeship"},{"sortkey":"","*":"1937_in_the_United_States"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Apprenticeship"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Frances Perkins"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"National Industrial Recovery Act"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"National Recovery Administration"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Trade unions"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"United States"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"United States Department of Labor"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"United States Secretary of Labor"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"United States Supreme Court"},{"ns":0,"*":"Federal Committee on Apprenticeship"}],"templates":[],"images":[],"externallinks":["http://www.realapprenticeship.com/mcat/mainweb/apprenticeshiphist2.htm","http://www.doleta.gov/oa/","http://www.doleta.gov/OA/Original_fitzact_code.cfm","http://www.doleta.gov/"],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"References","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"National_Apprenticeship_Act","byteoffset":2023,"anchor":"References"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"External links","number":"2","index":"2","fromtitle":"National_Apprenticeship_Act","byteoffset":2204,"anchor":"External_links"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"National Apprenticeship Act","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q6970389"}]}}
