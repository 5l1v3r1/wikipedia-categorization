A Higher Apprenticeship is the vocational equivalent to a Foundation University degree. This programme will deliver a level 4-5 qualification and can only be undertaken if a level 3 equivalent has already been achieved. However, more recently a number of Training Providers that offer higher apprenticeships do not always require these qualifications. Relevant experience could lead to an interview with the training provider before being accepted onto the programme. Higher apprenticeships have been designed for learners 18 years of age or older. Candidates interested in this programme must already have a level 3 qualification such as an advanced apprenticeship, A levels or an International Baccalaureate. However, some training providers will offer the programme if you have relevant experience. Higher Apprenticeships are now available in over 40 job areas.
