N.I.U. was a member of the Long Distance Learning Council *Cite (Long Distance Learning Council Catalog).  Their admissions process consisted of the initial registration process, student selection, and the review of student work and experience.  Students had to show proof of passing content specific exams before being considered for school admission.  They were also required to pass comprehensive exams at the completion of their respective program.  Furthermore, students were expected to complete a Practicum Learning Portfolio Log.  The time-requirement for portfolio hours varied by subject matter.  Lastly, students had to successfully complete and present research, before N.I.U. would issue their degree *Cite(Northwestern International University Registration Catalog).\n</p><p>Northwestern International University offered a <a href=\"/wiki/Distance_education\" title=\"Distance education\">long-distance</a>, blended program that allowed students flexibility in working towards an advanced degree.  It enabled them to broaden their professional expertise, and stretch their academic knowledge all on the students own time, and in their own environment *Cite (Northwestern International University Registration Catalog).\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Mission_statement\">Mission statement</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Northwestern_International_University&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Mission statement\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Northwestern International University was committed to developing the potential of each of its students.  It provided the opportunity for academic excellence and professional growth.  The university created a climate in which all members of the community could freely think, write, research, analyze, share, and criticize *Cite (Northwestern International University Registration Catalog).  It was committed to extending university resources to the entire student body.  According to their Registration Catalog, the Mission of N.I.U. was to:\n</p>\n<ol><li>Develop the skills essential to effective learning.</li>\n<li>Apply critical thought to decisions in all areas of life.</li>\n<li>Exercise responsibility in the local, national, and world community.</li>\n<li>Access, select, and prepare students for a career.</li>\n<li>Acquire attitudes and understanding necessary for effective human relationships.</li>\n<li>Complete degree programs off-campus at a time and site convenient to adult learners.</li></ol>\n<p>Based on this model, the program and experience offered high quality content and flexibility.  This enabled students to tailor their academic studies and <a href=\"/wiki/Coursework\" title=\"Coursework\">coursework</a> to fit in with the rest of their schedule *Cite (Northwestern International University Registration Catalog). Northwestern International University truly was an innovative educational and training organization.  At the time, its quality set it apart from others in adult long-distance/self-directed/online learning.  It was truly unique and a pioneer in its field.\n</p><p>N.I.U. was initially accredited by the Euro-American Accreditation Agency.  This organization (and its trustees) ensured the highest possible standards of academic excellence in curriculum design and operational policies in all university programs *Cite (Euro-American Accreditation Agency).\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Decline_and_Closure\">Decline and Closure</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Northwestern_International_University&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Decline and Closure\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Unfortunately, the academic programs of Northwestern began to decline in 2007. They were no longer considered rigorous, and <a href=\"/wiki/Course_credit\" title=\"Course credit\">academic credit</a> was being given erroneously, at best (solely based on Life Experience) *Cite (Google).  Furthermore, in 2007, the university\u2019s accreditation had been cancelled.  In 2008, the Accreditation Agency itself had been disbanded.  After the university reconfigured itself, students also \u201clost\u201d credit for some prior coursework.  N.I.U. was officially closed in 2009 *Cite (Consumer Protection).  Many states and nations do not accept their coursework, credit, and degrees if obtained after 2007 *Cite (Department of Education).  Those that were earned and granted (prior to 2007) are often accepted.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Northwestern_International_University&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li>Northwestern International University Registration Catalog &amp;
