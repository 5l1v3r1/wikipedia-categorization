FreedomProject Academy, often abbreviated FPA, is a private, online, Judeo-Christian school for students in kindergarten through high school that teaches from a Classical Christian education perspective. FPA is a school, not a self-paced program or tutorial service. Founded in 2011 in Appleton, Wisconsin, FreedomProject Academy provides a fully accredited curriculum that is not subsidized by any government funding. Courses are delivered live online through interactive classrooms to students around the world.  FreedomProject Academy, managed by FreedomProject Education, is owned by the American Opinion Foundation, a 501(c)(3) organization. All of FreedomProject Academy's courses are accredited by the National Association of Private Schools. The school does not offer rolling enrollment throughout the year or asynchronous classes. There are over 600 students enrolled at Freedom Project Academy as of the 2015-2016 school year.   FreedomProject Academy does not supply textbooks for students, but partners with Rainbow Resource to provide all required textbooks for purchase. FreedomProject Academy's parent company, FreedomProject Education, also runs a conservative media website called FreedomProject Media.
