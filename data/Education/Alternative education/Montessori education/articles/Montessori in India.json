It was an organisation consisting mainly of Joosten and Swamy. This travelling institution moved from city to city until Swamy's retirement in 1990. Ex-students from previous trainings working in the locality were called upon to be assistants. After Swamy's retirement, IMTC ran under the Directorship of Meenakshi Shivaramakrishnan. IMTC was now based in Bangalore. By the next decade, new branches were created at Chennai under the name CMTC.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Indian_Institute_for_Montessori_Studies_.28IIMS.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Indian_Institute_for_Montessori_Studies_(IIMS)\">Indian Institute for Montessori Studies (IIMS)</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Montessori_in_India&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Indian Institute for Montessori Studies (IIMS)\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Indian Montessori Center invited Rajendra Gupta to conduct a primary Montessori training at Bangalore in 1996. This was the first such course to be conducted in India after Montessori left the country. However, IMC discontinued the course after this year. To preserve the method thereafter, Rajendra Gupta set up Indian Institute for Montessori Studies with himself as the Director, Radha Nagaraj as the co-Director, with the help of a few of his students. IIMS continues to be a rarity where the work is carried out by a committee rather than an individual, adding more faculty over the years.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Indian_Montessori_Foundation_.28IMF.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Indian_Montessori_Foundation_(IMF)\">Indian Montessori Foundation (IMF)</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Montessori_in_India&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Indian Montessori Foundation (IMF)\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>At present, there are four AMI Montessori centres in India: Bangalore, Chennai, Hydrebad and Mumbai.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Other_Primary_Montessori_training_courses\">Other Primary Montessori training courses</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Montessori_in_India&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Other Primary Montessori training courses\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>After the popularising of the Primary Montessori Training by IIMS, several schools offering this method at the primary level came up in Bangalore, Tumkur, Chennai and Trichy.

In 1949, he was appointed Director of the Indian Montessori Training Courses, India, Joosten co-founded the Good Shepherd Maria Montessori Training Center at Colombo (Sri Lanka) in 1957.

Joosten conducted workshops and lectures in India, the U.S.A., Canada and several European countries and was speaker at several International Montessori Conference in Europe and the U.S.A.

After working for several years at his old school and at the AMI school of Gwalior, he moved to Delhi. When Joosten conducted his 6th \u2013 8th course in Delhi, Gupta acted as his assistant. His wife, Urmila Gupta also took her training at this period and joined him in his work for nearly a decade. When the Birth Centenary celebrations of Montessori was organised in New Delhi, he was in charge. A postage stamp was released on the occasion. V. V. Giri, President of India, presided over the function. Two years later, he left for US. Gupta stayed in touch with Joosten until his death in 1980, even visiting him during the latter\u2019s visit to Minnesota.\nGupta took his elementary training with Margaret Stevenson in the USA in 1978. Later he completed his Master of Education degree from Century University, New Mexico, USA. He worked in AMI Montessori Houses of Children for about 20 years in India and the USA and in AMI elementary Montessori Schools for 25 years in the USA.\nGupta was a Montessori trainer for both pre-primary and primary levels with the Southwest Montessori Training Center, Denton, Texas, USA for about ten years. He also gave orientation courses in Montessori Education at the College of St Scholastica, Duluth, Minnesota, and at the Chicago Community College, Illinois, USA. He was an Adjunct Professor with the University of Texas A &amp; I, Kingsville, Texas, USA where he gave a pre-primary Montessori course to the Master of Education students. Mr. Gupta gave workshops in India as well as in the USA on various subjects during 45 years of his teaching career. He has written manuals for Montessori teachers in the areas of botany, zoology, and language, and published classroom materials on science, language, botany, zoology, and history. He has also published books written by Albert Joosten and other Montessorians. Currently he is the Director of the Indian Institute for Montessori Studies which is conducting Pre-primary cum Elementary course in Bangalore, India.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Radha_Nagaraj\">Radha Nagaraj</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Montessori_in_India&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11\" title=\"Edit section: Radha Nagaraj\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Radha Nagaraj was a product of the infant Montessori school at Hymamshu. She took her pre-primary Montessori training from Joosten and Swamy in 1967\u201368 at the behest of the then Director, Sundaramma. She also set up a new Montessori at Mahila Mandali and worked there under the guidance of Swamy for ten years.\nJoosten came to Bangalore in 1978. Radha Nagaraj acted as his assistant for two years. She continued to work in Mahila Mandali since then as a Director. She took up assistance at IMTC from 1997 under Swamy, and continued to work there till 2002. She also handled the training in Kannada till 2004. The post of the co-Director of the pre-primary-cum-primary course at IIMS became hers in 2000, which continues to be hers till now.\nRadhaji has presented papers at the seminars organized by the Indian Montessori Center at Bangalore and at the celebration of 50 years of Montessori held at Chennai in 1989. She has been consulting with organisations like the Shreyas Foundation school at Ahmedabad and the Balasevika shibira of Vishva Hindu Parishad since 1990.

To solve that issue, IMC, a registered society was created in 1990 with S.R Swamy as the first chairman. Later, Meenakshi Sivaramakrishna continued as the Directess while B V A Rao took over as the chairman of IMC. Another center was also begun in South Bangalore. With all these new changes, AMI disaffiliated IMTC in 1999. IMTC came under the umbrella of IMC instead.
