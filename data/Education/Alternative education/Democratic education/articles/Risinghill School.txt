Risinghill School was an early comprehensive school opened in 1960 in Islington, under the headmastership of Michael Duane; a charismatic advocate of progressive and non-authoritarian education. The school's methods prompted criticism in the media and disputes with the London County Council. The school closed in 1965.   The school buildings in Risinghill Street, London N1, were subsequently utilised by Starcross School which was later renamed Elizabeth Garrett Anderson School. Pupils received religious education through Saint Silas Church, which was part of Risinghill. Lessons included technical and craft skills, taught through dual or multi-purpose creative methods.  3. http://www.leilaberg.com/her-books/books-for-grown-ups/risinghill-death-of-a-comprehensive/
