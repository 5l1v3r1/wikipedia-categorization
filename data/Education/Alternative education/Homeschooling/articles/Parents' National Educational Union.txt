The Parents' National Educational Union (abbreviated PNEU), founded in Bradford, Yorkshire in 1887 as the Parent's Educational Union, was an organisation providing resources and support for homeschoolers in the United Kingdom in accordance with the educational ideas of Charlotte Mason.  Mason was co-founder of PNEU together with Emeline Petrie Steinthal.  The word "National" was adopted as part of the name in 1890.  The PNEU national and international exposure is credited to Henrietta Franklin. She had met Mason in 1890 and by 1892 she had opened the first school in London based on these principals. In 1894 Franklin became the secretary of the PNEU and went on speaking tours to major cities in America, Europe and South Africa. She devoted her own money to the cause and wrote on its behalf. Franklin's biography cites the PNEU's continued existence to her.
