  The Melbourne Free University (or MFU) is an alternative university created in Melbourne in 2009.  The Melbourne Free University is committed to radical equality.  Its principles listed on its website include: Principles are explained in more detail in an article published in The National Times. Its principles are partly inspired by the works of Jacques Rancière. Its motto is THINK. DISCUSS. ACT. This project was co-founded by three colleagues from La Trobe University: Dr. Gerhard Hoffstaedter, social anthropologist; Dr. Aurelien Mondon, researcher in politics; and Jasmine-Kim Westendorf, Ph.D candidate in politics. Courses proliferated across a range of disciplines, including law, indigenous studies, refugee studies and a course on 'what if' - re-imagining how the world could be. Special seminars have included topics such as sexuality, gender studies, myths, aesthetics and others. In summer 2011/2012 the MFU is cooperating with Occupy Melbourne for a course   at City Square on issues relating to the global Occupy movement.
