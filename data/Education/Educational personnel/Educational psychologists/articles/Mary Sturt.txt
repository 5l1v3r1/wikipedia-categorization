Mary Sturt (8 September 1896 - 1994?) was a British educational psychologist and historian of education.  She was Vice-Principal of St Mary's College, Bangor, an Anglican teacher-training college for women.  Sturt collaborated with Ellen Oakden in several pieces of writing. Their Modern Psychology and Education (1926) was welcomed by its Observer reviewer as "one of the most informative, interesting, and humorous things that I have ever seen as an attampt to write for training-college students".  They also adapted works for children for 'The King's Treasuries of Literature', a series edited by Arthur Quiller-Couch: The Canterbury Pilgrims bowdlerised some of the bawdier elements of the Canterbury Tales.  Sturt's biography of Francis Bacon defended Bacon against Macaulay, whom she characterised as "a man writing in semi-ignorance to please the most hypocritical audience that ever existed".  On retirement she taught for a year in Sarawak in Borneo.
