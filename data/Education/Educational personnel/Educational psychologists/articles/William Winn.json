In addition to teaching, extensive graduate advising activities, and a prolific writing schedule, at the time of his death he was working on research with the Puget Sound Marine Environment Modeling Group, augmented reality and physical models of complex organic molecules, INFACT/PixelMath, and collaborating with PRISM and the Center for Environmental Visualization.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Computer-based_learning\">Computer-based learning</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=William_Winn&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Computer-based learning\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Winn was very interested in <a href=\"/wiki/Computer-based_learning\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Computer-based learning\">computer-based learning</a> for being a method that allows students to obtain information in formats that cannot be presented by teachers and because it gives the students control of the information. He acknowledged that computer-based learning follows a <a href=\"/wiki/Constructivism_(learning_theory)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Constructivism (learning theory)\">constructivist</a> learning approach because students construct understandings for themselves by interacting with the material they encounter.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Winn_2-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Winn-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Virtual_environments\">Virtual environments</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=William_Winn&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Virtual environments\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Winn also focused his research in constructing <a href=\"/wiki/Virtual_reality\" title=\"Virtual reality\">virtual learning environments</a> which are computer created environments intended to simulate realistic experiences in order to help students understand concepts presented in those environments. For example, Winn explained \u201cthat the act of designing and creating environments that embody concepts and principles governing phenomena as diverse as wetlands ecology and medieval castles helps students master these topics with depth and clarity\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Winn_2-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Winn-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> He also found that virtual learning has greater success for students who do poorly in school. However, teaching through virtual environments also has its weaknesses. Winn declared that this method of learning often result in misconceptions due to oversimplifying the interactions that occur in the natural environments which are simulated.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Winn_2-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Winn-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>  Additionally, problems in the transfer of knowledge are seen in younger students who lack the ability to think abstractly. These children have a difficulty transferring what they learn in the virtual world to other areas in the real world.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Winn_2-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Winn-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Learning_oceanography_from_a_computer_compared_to_direct_experience_at_sea\">Learning oceanography from a computer compared to direct experience at sea</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=William_Winn&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Learning oceanography from a computer compared to direct experience at sea\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>This is an example of one of the studies conducted by Winn in which he evaluated the difference of learning in a computer-based environment as opposed to learning through direct experience. In this study, two groups of college students learned <a href=\"/wiki/Oceanography\" title=\"Oceanography\">oceanography</a>. One group learned using a computer simulation of the ocean which included a three-dimensional (3D) model, and the other group learned by spending a day in a research vessel and used oceanographic tools.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Winn,_W._3-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Winn,_W.-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> In his discussion of this study Winn makes reference to Kolb\u2019s <a href=\"/wiki/Experiential_learning\" title=\"Experiential learning\">experiential learning theory</a> because it highlights the significance of direct experience with the environment, as well as the need for abstract concepts in order to learn and apply knowledge. According to Winn, the proper use of metaphors in simulations may allow students to learn abstract concepts better than they would in real experiences.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Winn,_W._3-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Winn,_W.-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> This study took place in <a href=\"/wiki/Seattle\" title=\"Seattle\">Seattle</a> and was focused on the oceanography of the <a href=\"/wiki/Puget_Sound\" title=\"Puget Sound\">Puget Sound</a> estuary system within <a href=\"/wiki/Washington_(U.S._state)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Washington (U.S. state)\">Washington</a>. There were 25 students in each group and both groups received a total of three lessons. Two of the lessons were taught by the same professors and covered the same material. For the third lesson the groups were separated to their different settings.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Winn,_W._3-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Winn,_W.-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> One of the limitations of this study was that the students taking the \u201cVirtual Puget Sound\u201d (VPS) experience could only control some <a href=\"/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables\" title=\"Dependent and independent variables\">independent variables</a> but not others, like for example they could not change the <a href=\"/wiki/Salinity\" title=\"Salinity\">salinity</a> of the water. The results of the study showed \u201cno difference in overall learning between students who used the VPS simulation and those who studied the same material in the field\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Winn,_W._3-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Winn,_W.-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>  However, the study found that students with less experience in water learned more from direct experience, while the simulated ocean experience helped students transfer the knowledge they obtained while working in the computer, to the material presented in class.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Winn,_W._3-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Winn,_W.-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Response_to_criticism\">Response to criticism</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=William_Winn&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Response to criticism\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>After reading Winn\u2019s article titled \"Current trends in educational technology research: The study of learning environments\" published in 2002, the educational psychologist <a href=\"/wiki/Richard_E._Mayer\" title=\"Richard E. Mayer\">Richard Mayer</a> (2003) criticized Winn\u2019s article for dismissing controlled experiments and in this way dismissing an approach that would produce substantial evidence and enable researchers to make claims on the learning development of students. In response to Mayer\u2019s criticism, Winn confirmed that experimental research is important, and he proposed that researchers use a system that connects evidence from both experimental and non-experimental research when conducting their studies since each method produces different information. Controlled experimental research is useful for obtaining details about student learning, and non-experimental research allows the researcher to see how learning occurs in real settings.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Winn,(2002)_4-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Winn,(2002)-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Non-experimental_research_method\">Non-experimental research method</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=William_Winn&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Non-experimental research method\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>As part of his response to Mayer\u2019s criticism, Winn articulates that a good non-experimental method for researchers to use is the \u201cdesign experiment\u201d which was described by <a href=\"/wiki/Ann_Brown\" title=\"Ann Brown\">Ann Brown</a> in 1992. Winn prefers this type of experiment particularly because it conveys many features of open ended research methods.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Winn,(2002)_4-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Winn,(2002)-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> In a design experiment, the researcher tests his or her intervention in an educational setting such as a classroom, makes modifications depending on the data collected, and conducts the intervention until it produces good results. The data collected is in form of observations, results from tests, or any form of work that will show that the student has learned what is expected. Compared to a controlled experiment in which many variables are controlled, in the design experiment, modifications are made over time. Winn explained that a key difference between the two types of experiments is that \u201cthe controlled experiment adapts the setting to suit the intervention through experimental control, whereas the design experiment adapts the intervention to suit the setting through iteration\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Winn,(2002)_4-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Winn,(2002)-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> Although Winn is in favor of design experiments he does note one of its weaknesses. This type of non-experimental research involves more time and skill than implementing experimental research. However, it can yield crucial evidence about the success of interventions and how students learn.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Winn,(2002)_4-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Winn,(2002)-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Implications_for_educational_technology\">Implications for educational technology</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=William_Winn&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Implications for educational technology\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Winn made significant contributions<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources.
