Charles Hubbard Judd (February 20, 1873 â€“ July 18, 1946 ) was an American educational psychologist who played an influential role in the formation of the discipline. Part of the larger scientific movement of this period, Judd pushed for the use of scientific methods to the understanding of education and, thus, wanted to limit the use of theory in the field. Born in Bareilly, India of American missionary parents, Judd obtained a PhD at the University of Leipzig under the tutelage of Wilhelm Wundt.  Judd was director of the Department of Education at the University of Chicago from 1909 to 1938.  His works include Genetic Psychology for Teachers, Psychology of Social Institutions and Psychology of High-School Subjects (Boston, 1915).
