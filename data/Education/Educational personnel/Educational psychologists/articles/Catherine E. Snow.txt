With Brian MacWhinney, Snow founded the Child Language Data Exchange System (CHILDES) database, a corpus of children's speech used by numerous language acquisition researchers.  More recently, Snow's research has focused on early childhood literacy, investigating linguistic and social factors that contribute to or detract from literacy.  With Anat Ninio, Snow published extensively on pragmatic development.  She is also on the advisory board of FFIPP-USA (Faculty for Israeli-Palestinian Peace-USA), a network of Palestinian, Israeli, and International faculty, and students, working in for an end of the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories and just peace.
