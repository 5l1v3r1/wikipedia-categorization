Gene V Glass (born June 19, 1940) is an American statistician and researcher working in educational psychology and the social sciences. According to the science writer Morton Hunt, he coined the term "meta-analysis" and illustrated its first use in his presidential address to the American Educational Research Association in San Francisco in April, 1976. The most extensive illustration of the technique was to the literature on psychotherapy outcome studies, published in 1980 by Johns Hopkins University Press under the title Benefits of Psychotherapy by Mary Lee Smith, Gene V Glass, and Thomas I. Miller.  Gene V Glass is a Regents' Professor Emeritus at Arizona State University in both the educational leadership and policy studies and psychology in education divisions, having retired in 2010 from the Mary Lou Fulton Institute and Graduate School of Education. Currently he is a senior researcher at the National Education Policy Center  , a Research Professor in the School of Education at the University of Colorado Boulder, and a Lecturer in the Connie L. Lurie College of Education at San Jose State University. In 2003, he was elected to membership in the National Academy of Education.   Glass was born in Lincoln, Nebraska and educated in the Lincoln Public School system, graduating from Lincoln, Northeast High School in 1958. He attended Nebraska Wesleyan University from 1958 to 1960 and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln from 1960 to January, 1962, earning a bachelor's degree with a joint major in mathematics and German. He worked as a research assistant for Robert E. Stake at UNL from spring 1961 until graduation. At Stake's suggestion, he chose to immediately enroll in graduate school. He entered the PhD program in statistics, measurement and experimental design at the University of Wisconsin, Madison in February 1962. He graduated with a PhD in Educational Psychology in May, 1965, having studied with Julian C. Stanley, Chester W. Harris, and Henry F. Kaiser. His doctoral dissertation, entitled Alpha Factor Analysis of Infallible Variables, won the Creative Talent award in Psychometrics given by the American Institutes for Research for 1966. In August 1965, he joined Stake and other colleagues as an assistant professor in the Center for Instructional Research and Curriculum Evaluation at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, where he taught for two years before moving to the University of Colorado Boulder. He was promoted to professor at CU-Boulder in 1970. In 1986, Glass joined the faculty of the Arizona State University in Tempe, Arizona, from which he retired in 2010. He holds the title of Regents' Professor Emeritus from Arizona State University. In 2011, he joined the faculty of the School of Education at the University of Colorado Boulder  as a research professor. He has served as a senior researcher in the  National Education Policy Center since 2010. In 1970, he published his first book, Statistical Methods in Education and Psychology, with his adviser Julian C. Stanley as co-author. The book, which was started in 1964 while Glass was still a graduate student, went through three editions, the most recent having been published in 1996 with Kenneth D. Hopkins as co-author. In all, as of 2010 his   professional résumé lists some 23 books and more than 250 articles, reviews and reports. His scholarly contributions are divided into three periods: 1964–1974 statistical methods including contributions to factor analysis and meta-analysis; 1975–1985 psychotherapy outcome research; 1986–2010 education policy analysis.

Shepard). In recent years he has championed the cause of open access to scholarly literature, having created in 1993 the ("free-to-read") online journal Education Policy Analysis Archives and in 1998 the multi-lingual online book review journal Education Review, both of which journals remained in continuous publication in 2010. In 2006, he was honored with the Distinguished Contributions to Educational Research Award of the American Educational Research Association.
