He is one of the main researchers of Computer Supported Intentional Learning Environments (CSILE), the first networked system for collaborative learning.  The second generation of product was renamed Knowledge Forum. Bereiter is one of the founders and leading researchers of the Institute for Knowledge Innovation and Technology, (IKIT).  His educational contributions, along with those of Ludwig Wittgenstein, Martin Heidegger, Jean Piaget, Lev Vygotsky, Michel Foucault, Howard Gardner, and others, are profiled in Fifty Modern Thinkers on Education.  He became well known for a 1966 proposal cowritten with Siegfried Engelmann on the persistent gap between inner city and middle class children in educational achievement that appeared in Teaching Disadvantaged Children in the Preschool.  This position came to be called the cultural deficit hypothesis. This provoked a response by William Labov encapsulated in a much reprinted paper called "The logic of non-standard English."  that argued that cultural and linguistic difference rather than deficit lay behind much of the gap. Bereiter has claimed that he was misread by his critics.
