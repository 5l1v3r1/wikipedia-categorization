Ms. Choksondik has extremely exaggerated saggy <a href=\"/wiki/Breasts\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Breasts\">breasts</a>, is overweight, wears glasses, and has a <a href=\"/wiki/Amblyopia\" title=\"Amblyopia\">lazy eye</a>. She also does not wear a bra, and when she lifts her arms, the bottom few inches of her breasts show below the bottom of her blouse. One of the early jokes about Ms. Choksondik is that the children do not get the obvious pun in her name, and try to create other names for her (such as \"makesmesick\", \"chokesonbricks\" and \"chokesonrocks\"). She corrects them in full seriousness. In the episode \"<a href=\"/wiki/Proper_Condom_Use\" title=\"Proper Condom Use\">Proper Condom Use</a>\", it is strongly implied that her contemptuous attitude towards <a href=\"/wiki/Human_sexual_activity\" title=\"Human sexual activity\">sexual activity</a> stems from the fact that no man before <a href=\"/wiki/Mr._Mackey\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Mr. Mackey\">Mr. Mackey</a> had any sexual interest in her.\n</p><p>The episode \"<a href=\"/wiki/Professor_Chaos_(South_Park_episode)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Professor Chaos (South Park episode)\">Professor Chaos</a>\" ends on a <a href=\"/wiki/Cliffhanger\" title=\"Cliffhanger\">cliffhanger</a> saying someone would die, in a parody of cliffhanger endings, and it was revealed during this gag that Ms. Choksondik has died. In the episode \"<a href=\"/wiki/Simpsons_Already_Did_It\" title=\"Simpsons Already Did It\">Simpsons Already Did It</a>\", the boys reveal they put some of their <a href=\"/wiki/Sea-Monkeys\" title=\"Sea-Monkeys\">Sea People</a> in her coffee. When she dies soon after, they became horrified when they thought that their prank had killed her. Later, the news says that large amounts of <a href=\"/wiki/Semen\" title=\"Semen\">semen</a> (or, as the boys took it, \"sea men\") had been found in her stomach, and they go to great lengths to hide their apparent role in her death, until Chef explains that Ms. Choksondik must have died from something else. After her death, the boys receive two weeks off school to \"deal with\" her death, and then are taught for a short time by Mr. Mackey before <a href=\"/wiki/Mr._Garrison\" title=\"Mr. Garrison\">Mr. Garrison</a> is allowed a return to teach them.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Ms._Claridge\">Ms. Claridge</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=List_of_South_Park_Elementary_staff&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Ms. Claridge\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><b>Ms. Claridge</b> is a South Park Elementary preschool teacher. Her first appearance was in \"<a href=\"/wiki/Pre-School_(South_Park)\" title=\"Pre-School (South Park)\">Pre-School</a>\". Ms. Claridge was disabled and covered in burns after a fire broke out in the pre-school classroom at South Park Elementary. The fire was started when Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny wanted to play \"fireman\" and asked the \"baddest kid in pre-school\", Trent Boyett, to start a fire for them. In spite of the boys' efforts to extinguish the fire (by urinating on it), the fire grew out of control and nearly killed Ms. Claridge. Ms. Claridge survived, but was badly injured and placed in an electric <a href=\"/wiki/Wheelchair\" title=\"Wheelchair\">wheelchair</a> which very much resembles that of <a href=\"/wiki/Christopher_Pike_(Star_Trek)\" title=\"Christopher Pike (Star Trek)\">Captain Christopher Pike</a> in the original <i><a href=\"/wiki/Star_Trek\" title=\"Star Trek\">Star Trek</a></i> episode \"<a href=\"/wiki/The_Menagerie_(Star_Trek)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Menagerie (Star Trek)\">The Menagerie</a>\".\n</p><p>Ms. Claridge communicates by 'beeping' once for yes and twice for no. It is not clear how she can function as a teacher if she can only communicate \"yes\" and \"no\", yet her students appear to understand her.\n</p><p>The boys denied all culpability for the fire and Trent Boyett was sent to Juvenile Hall for five years. While trying to escape the newly released Trent, Cartman fires a taser gun, which accidentally powers Ms. Claridge's wheelchair, sending her crashing into a propane shop, exploding and setting her alight once again. The police arrive and ask if Trent started the fire. She replies \"no\" with two beeps but the police mistake it for \"yes yes\" and arrest Trent.\n</p><p>Ms. Claridge appears briefly in two other episodes, \"<a href=\"/wiki/The_Death_of_Eric_Cartman\" title=\"The Death of Eric Cartman\">The Death of Eric Cartman</a>\", where Cartman, in his efforts to atone for his life's misdeeds, gives her a fruit basket, and also again at the talent show in \"<a href=\"/wiki/Erection_Day\" title=\"Erection Day\">Erection Day</a>\".\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Mr._Connors\">Mr. Connors</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=List_of_South_Park_Elementary_staff&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Mr. Connors\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><b>Mr. Connors</b> (Trey Parker) was the wrestling teacher at the school. He appeared in \"<a href=\"/wiki/W.T.F._(South_Park)\" title=\"W.T.F.

She was the bus driver for South Park elementary, and enforced incredibly strict discipline on the bus, constantly yelling at the students to enforce quiet. She does the same to adult staff travelling on the bus, and doesn't seem to understand that she can't report the staff for disorderly conduct like she would with the students. The students often mutter various insults to her, then quickly cover them up with poor excuses when she demanded they repeat themselves. However, <a href=\"/wiki/Stan_Marsh\" title=\"Stan Marsh\">Stan Marsh</a> once repeated the insult back word for word. As a result, Ms. Crabtree said \"oh\" and drove off without letting the boys getting on the bus.\n</p><p>In one episode, a kid from the drug rehabilitation center (across from Cartman's <a href=\"/wiki/Fat_camp\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Fat camp\">fat camp</a>) is forced to climb into Ms. Crabtree's body <a href=\"/wiki/Vagina\" title=\"Vagina\">vaginally</a> while pretending to be Kenny (who was arrested for prostitution), but was rebirthed <a href=\"/wiki/Stillbirth\" title=\"Stillbirth\">stillborn</a>. Moments later, she squeezed out another kid, who resembled <a href=\"/wiki/Harry_Potter_(character)\" title=\"Harry Potter (character)\">Harry Potter</a>.\n</p><p>In the episode \"<a href=\"/wiki/Chef_Aid\" title=\"Chef Aid\">Chef Aid</a>\", Chef resorts to <a href=\"/wiki/Prostitution\" title=\"Prostitution\">prostitution</a> to get needed money, and Ms. Crabtree, over whose head he puts a bag first, is one of his \"customers\".\n</p><p>The character's biggest role was in the season 2 episode \"<a href=\"/wiki/City_on_the_Edge_of_Forever_(South_Park)\" title=\"City on the Edge of Forever (South Park)\">City on the Edge of Forever</a>\", where she has the main role in the episode's b-plot. After the bus becomes stranded at the edge of a cliff, Ms Crabtree leaves the children behind to try to find assistance, but ends up getting sidetracked by a stand up comedian agent who draws her into a career in stand-up. She eventually starts a romantic relationship with a truck driver she met while hitchhiking, and the two spends the last few minutes of the show watching the sunset together.\n</p><p>Ms. Crabtree&#160;\u2013 as well as the bird nesting on her head&#160;\u2013 was murdered by a serial killer in the 2004 episode \"Cartman's Incredible Gift\". Detectives investigating the crime in the episodes noted she was \"an <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ancillary\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikt:ancillary\">ancillary</a> character the fans wouldn't miss much\".

Voiced by Trey Parker, the character commonly displays slapstick and physical camp humor, much to the chagrin of the boys. He tends to hit himself in the head with a <a href=\"/wiki/Claw_hammer\" title=\"Claw hammer\">claw hammer</a> in attempts to make the boys laugh. In the season three commentary, Matt and Trey reveal that his namesake, \"Derp\", is the sound commonly made in a klutzy situation when things go horribly wrong, literally and comically, like a joke that can be \"seen from a mile away\". The word <i>derp</i> has become a popular phrase and <a href=\"/wiki/Internet_meme\" title=\"Internet meme\">Internet meme</a>.\n</p><p>He has also since appeared in the background in \"<a href=\"/wiki/Eek!_A_Penis!\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Eek!

She was promoted to a permanent teaching position after Mr. Garrison, enjoying his new '<a href=\"/wiki/David_Hasselhoff\" title=\"David Hasselhoff\">David Hasselhoff</a>' look, quit to do what he \"always wanted to do: hang out and screw hot chicks.\" Chef went out on a date with Ms. Ellen and only to find out that she is a <a href=\"/wiki/Lesbian\" title=\"Lesbian\">lesbian</a>. When the boys found out that she was a lesbian, they tried every effort to become one themselves. Ms. Ellen's attractive looks and kind nature caused the boys in the class to develop deep amorous feelings towards her, which also caused Wendy to become very jealous (oblivious to the fact that Ms. Ellen does not reciprocate their interest).

In the beginning, Garrison was in denial of his homosexuality to the point of <a href=\"/wiki/Homophobia\" title=\"Homophobia\">homophobia</a>, and was always seen with either of his hand puppets that he claimed were gay. Later he went missing, hiding on a mountain, living in isolation. He eventually \"came out of the closet\" and returned with the intention to teach again.

He has a disproportionately large head and mumbles \"M'kay\" into most sentences.  He speaks with a <a href=\"/wiki/Southern_American_English\" title=\"Southern American English\">Southern accent</a>, and he is believed to be from <a href=\"/wiki/Louisiana\" title=\"Louisiana\">Louisiana</a>. It is assumed he is at least 40 years old (he once said he had sex at 19 and that it has been about 21 years since). He is based on Trey Parker's junior high school counselor, Stan Lackey. He has occasionally taught classes at the school, and taught sex education with <a href=\"/wiki/Ms._Choksondik\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Ms. Choksondik\">Ms. Choksondik</a>. During this time he had a sexual relationship with Ms. Choksondik until her death.

In the episode \"<a href=\"/wiki/Erection_Day\" title=\"Erection Day\">Erection Day</a>\" he is shown to be left-handed.\n</p><p>Despite his slightly odd appearance and catchphrase (M'kay), Mr. Mackey is generally portrayed as an able and responsible counselor who actually cares about the children, much unlike Mr. Garrison and other adult authority figures. He sometimes appears with Principal Victoria when punishing a student or announcing an important message. His methods as a counselor often reflect real-life controversies in education. For example, when Kyle talks about seeing <a href=\"/wiki/Mr._Hankey\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Mr. Hankey\">Mr. Hankey the Christmas Poo</a>, he places Kyle on a heavy dose prescription of <a href=\"/wiki/Prozac\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Prozac\">Prozac</a>.

For this, Mr. Mackey is fired by the school, evicted by his landlord, and, feeling depressed, he ends up using alcohol, marijuana and LSD. The episode suggests that his large head is caused by the tightness of his tie around his neck, but in \"<a href=\"/wiki/Child_Abduction_Is_Not_Funny\" title=\"Child Abduction Is Not Funny\">Child Abduction Is Not Funny</a>\", his parents are shown to have large heads as well. He becomes a hippie and travels to India with a like-minded woman. Mr. Mackey is captured by <a href=\"/wiki/The_A-Team\" title=\"The A-Team\">The A-Team</a>, and his former employers, along with <a href=\"/wiki/Jimbo_Kern\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Jimbo Kern\">Jimbo</a>, say that they should have helped him with his drug problem rather than firing him. Mr. Mackey protests, saying that he likes his new life and that he actually has not done drugs since his first experimentations back in South Park. Nobody listens and in rehab at the <a href=\"/wiki/Betty_Ford_Center\" title=\"Betty Ford Center\">Betty Ford Clinic</a>, he is \"cured\" of his addiction to drugs. Mr. Mackey's social worker then re-ties his tie, which makes his head swell back to its original size.\n</p><p>In the episode \"<a href=\"/wiki/Something_You_Can_Do_with_Your_Finger\" title=\"Something You Can Do with Your Finger\">Something You Can Do with Your Finger</a>\" he is shown to have a bondage sex scene with <a href=\"/wiki/Liane_Cartman\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Liane Cartman\">Liane Cartman</a>.
