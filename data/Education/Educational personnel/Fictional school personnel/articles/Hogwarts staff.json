Cuthbert Binns has the distinction of being the only teacher at Hogwarts who is a <a href=\"/wiki/Ghosts_(Harry_Potter)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Ghosts (Harry Potter)\">ghost</a>. It is said that one day he took a nap in a chair in the teachers' lounge/staff room and died in his sleep; later, he simply got up to go to teach his next class and \"left his body behind\". His lessons are said to be notoriously boring and it is mentioned that the most exciting thing that ever happens in his class is his \"entering through the blackboard\". As a ghost he seems unaware of his change from living to dead. In the second book it is he who describes the legend of the <a href=\"/wiki/Chamber_of_Secrets\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Chamber of Secrets\">Chamber of Secrets</a> when asked by the students, but in the film version it is McGonagall, as Binns does not appear in any of the films.

Alecto Carrow taught Muggle Studies, now a required course; however, instead of encouraging understanding of <a href=\"/wiki/Muggle\" title=\"Muggle\">Muggles</a>, she taught ideologies that Muggles were no better than animals. Amycus Carrow taught Defence Against the Dark Arts; however it is noted that there was no defence involved because they had changed the name to Dark Arts, so Amycus frequently taught students the <a href=\"/wiki/Unforgivable_Curses\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Unforgivable Curses\">Unforgivable Curses</a> and openly encouraged them to practice these on their classmates who earned themselves detention.\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore\" title=\"Albus Dumbledore\">Albus Dumbledore</a>\n</td>\n<td><a href=\"/wiki/Transfiguration_(Harry_Potter)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Transfiguration (Harry Potter)\">Transfiguration</a> / deputy headmaster / headmaster\n</td>\n<td>The Headmaster of Hogwarts since a few decades before Harry's birth until Harry's sixth year at Hogwarts when Dumbledore is killed by Snape on his request.

A number of students in Harry's year prefer Grubbly-Plank, as unlike Hagrid, she is quite happy to teach them about creatures that don't have poisonous fangs, or deadly talons.

While he is not an evil character, he is ill-tempered, which makes him unpopular with the student body, and occasionally causes tension or exasperation with teachers and other staff. His knowledge of the secrets and short-cuts of the castle is almost unparalleled, except perhaps by the users of the <a href=\"/wiki/Marauder%27s_Map\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Marauder&#39;s Map\">Marauder's Map</a> (the <a href=\"/wiki/Weasley_twins\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Weasley twins\">Weasley twins</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Harry_Potter_(character)\" title=\"Harry Potter (character)\">Harry</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Ron_Weasley\" title=\"Ron Weasley\">Ron</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Hermione_Granger\" title=\"Hermione Granger\">Hermione</a>), and Voldemort himself. He tends to favor almost sadistically harsh punishments, and gleefully allies himself with Umbridge when she prescribes such punishments on students. He has an obsessive dislike of mud, animate toys, and all other things that might interfere with his desire for an immaculately clean and orderly Hogwarts.

He does however, choose to leave a small patch of it behind, because he thinks it is \"a good bit of magic\" and a tribute to the Weasley twins.

However, he is greatly admired by many others, particularly witches (including Hermione and the Weasley mother <a href=\"/wiki/Molly_Weasley\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Molly Weasley\">Molly Weasley</a>) who find him attractive. Harry dislikes Lockhart for a number of reasons: his arrogance, his belief that Harry flew to Hogwarts in a <a href=\"/wiki/Magical_objects_in_Harry_Potter#Arthur_Weasley&#39;s_Ford_Anglia\" title=\"Magical objects in Harry Potter\">car</a> to seek further attention, his penchant for handing out signed photos of himself, and the trouble he has with simple magic such as healing Harry's broken arm (he accidentally removes all of Harry's arm bones instead).

Lockhart is childishly proud of being able to write in <a href=\"/wiki/Cursive\" title=\"Cursive\">\"joined-up letters\"</a>. He still enjoys signing autographs and still receives fan mail, although he has no idea why.

McGonagall is described as a tall, rather severe-looking woman, with black hair typically drawn into a tight bun. She wears emerald green robes, a pointed hat, and always has a very prim expression. She speaks with a slight Scottish accent. She is, according to Rowling, a sprightly 70-year-old.<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> McGonagall wears square spectacles that match the markings around the eyes of her <a href=\"/wiki/Animagus\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Animagus\">Animagus</a> form of a <a href=\"/wiki/British_Shorthair\" title=\"British Shorthair\">British Shorthair</a> silver <a href=\"/wiki/Tabby_cat\" title=\"Tabby cat\">tabby cat</a>; she has the distinction of being the first Animagus introduced in the series and being one of the few registered Animagi of the century, though she was rarely seen using the ability. Harry's immediate impression of her is of someone who is not to be crossed. She has a fondness for <a href=\"/wiki/Tartan\" title=\"Tartan\">tartan</a>, and her handkerchief, at least one hat, dressing gown, and dress robes are patterned with it. In the films, McGonagall often wears a Scottish brooch of a specific Scots style set with Cairngorm citrines and Scottish agate.\n</p><p>In the first book, after seeing Harry fly masterfully his very first time on a broom, she recommends him to fill the position of <a href=\"/wiki/Quidditch#Players\" title=\"Quidditch\">Seeker</a> on the Gryffindor Quidditch team and sends him a broom, even though first-year students are normally prohibited from playing the sport or owning brooms. Despite the fact that she can often be heard to caution Lee Jordan's biased remarks while commenting Hogwart's Quidditch matches, it is often indirectly revealed that McGonagall herself is an avid Quidditch fan, resulting in a few occasions of her dropping her usual demeanour. Furthermore, although a rigorous disciplinarian, she often assists Harry indirectly with activities that are not strictly within the rules of Hogwarts; for example, she allows Harry and his friends to use the Transfiguration classroom to practice for tasks in the <a href=\"/wiki/Triwizard_Tournament\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Triwizard Tournament\">Triwizard Tournament</a>. She promises Harry she would do everything in her power to help him to achieve his goal of becoming an <a href=\"/wiki/Auror\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Auror\">auror</a>, and she keeps her promise.<sup id=\"cite_ref-october-2007-wotm_9-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-october-2007-wotm-9\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> Despite her stern front, McGonagall is shown to have good intentions at heart and has been known to display a range of emotions, which can often be a shock to her colleagues and students.\n</p><p>It is revealed in <i>Order of the Phoenix</i> that McGonagall is a member of the <a href=\"/wiki/Order_of_the_Phoenix_(organisation)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Order of the Phoenix (organisation)\">Order of the Phoenix</a>. She and Umbridge seem to have a mutual dislike for each other, as Umbridge continuously usurps more and more power from the staff and from Dumbledore and McGonagall in particular. McGonagall quietly resists, vowing to assist Harry's lukewarm desire to become an auror primarily to spite Umbridge, and ignoring and even quietly aiding <a href=\"/wiki/Peeves\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Peeves\">Peeves</a> and the students in their destructive pranks. When McGonagall attempts to stop Umbridge and her fellow Ministry cronies from unjustly taking Hagrid away by force, she is hit by four <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=List_of_spells_in_Harry_Potter&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"List of spells in Harry Potter (page does not exist)\">stunning spells</a> without warning, before she can draw her wand, but Hagrid manages to escape due to his giant heritage. In an unconscious state, she is rushed to <a href=\"/wiki/St_Mungo%27s_Hospital_for_Magical_Maladies_and_Injuries\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"St Mungo&#39;s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries\">St Mungo's</a>, where she recovers for a while. McGonagall returns to the school towards the end of the book, though she temporarily uses a walking stick. After the death of Dumbledore in <i>Half-Blood Prince</i>, she becomes the acting Headmistress of Hogwarts.\n</p><p>However, in the series finale, she does not become headmistress at the start of term as expected; Snape is appointed by the new Minister for Magic Thicknesse, who is actually under the <a href=\"/wiki/Imperius_Curse\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Imperius Curse\">Imperius Curse</a> and acting for Voldemort. Death eater Alecto Carrow replaces McGonagall as deputy headmistress. Despite the many changes, she is retained as head of Gryffindor House. Before the Battle of Hogwarts, she goes to the Ravenclaw tower and finds Alecto stunned by Luna and Amycus Carrow searching for Harry. She's surprised when Amycus tells her Voldemort warned them Harry would try to break into the Ravenclaw Tower, proudly telling him Harry has no business on the Ravenclaw Tower, for Harry is in her House, Gryffindor. When Amycus suggests blaming the students to compensate for his sister's state, McGonagall immediately intervenes. In response, Amycus spits in her face. Harry, who is present and hidden under his invisibility cloak, reveals himself and uses the <a href=\"/wiki/Cruciatus_Curse\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cruciatus Curse\">Cruciatus Curse</a> on Amycus.  Harry then informs McGonagall that Voldemort is on his way and after tying up both the Carrows and placing them in a net, she sends three <a href=\"/wiki/Patronus_Charm\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Patronus Charm\">Patronuses</a> \u2013 which manifest as a cat-to warn the other three Heads of House.<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> When on her way to meet the Heads of House, she meets Snape, who questions her about Harry's whereabouts. Not realising that Snape is a re-doubled agent acting for the good side and not knowing that he has important information for Harry, she attacks him, engaging in a fierce duel. With help from Professors Sprout and Flitwick, she succeeds in driving Snape away. McGonagall then takes charge of the school again and proceeds to secure it against Voldemort to ensure Harry can fulfil his mission from Dumbledore. She also organises the evacuation of the school's under-age students to ensure their safety. She then leads the remaining students, the staff of Hogwarts, and members of the Order of the Phoenix in the fight against Voldemort. She is seen during the battle with a large gash on her cheek and commanding a herd of charmed desks to charge at Death Eaters. When Harry has been apparently killed, she screams, causing <a href=\"/wiki/Bellatrix_Lestrange\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Bellatrix Lestrange\">Bellatrix Lestrange</a> to laugh. Finally, McGonagall ends up duelling Voldemort alongside <a href=\"/wiki/Kingsley_Shacklebolt\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Kingsley Shacklebolt\">Kingsley Shacklebolt</a> and Professor Slughorn. As is confirmed in <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Tales_of_Beedle_the_Bard\" title=\"The Tales of Beedle the Bard\">The Tales of Beedle the Bard</a></i>, McGonagall becomes Headmistress of Hogwarts after the Battle of Hogwarts and Snape's death; however, in an interview Rowling said McGonagall would be retired by the time of the <i>Deathly Hallows</i> epilogue (19 years after the main events of <i>Deathly Hallows</i>), as she is \"getting on in years\".\n</p><p>McGonagall is played by <a href=\"/wiki/Maggie_Smith\" title=\"Maggie Smith\">Dame Maggie Smith</a> in the film adaptations. Smith has described her role as \"<a href=\"/wiki/Jean_Brodie\" title=\"Jean Brodie\">Miss Jean Brodie</a> in a wizard's hat\". Given that her role becomes progressively smaller as the series goes on, she notes that <i><a href=\"/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher%27s_Stone_(film)\" title=\"Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#39;s Stone (film)\">Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</a></i> is her favourite.<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> Smith appeared in all the films of the series except for <i><a href=\"/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows_%E2%80%93_Part_1\" title=\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1\">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1</a></i>, which does not take place in Hogwarts.

Fred and George constantly joke that the turban was full of garlic to ward away vampires and in one part they even enchant snowballs to hit it.<sup id=\"cite_ref-15\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-15\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup> According to JK Rowling, Quirrell taught Muggle Studies before Harry studied at Hogwarts, which explains why he was a teacher before but at the same time only a Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher for one year.<sup id=\"cite_ref-16\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-16\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Harry first meets Quirrell at the <a href=\"/wiki/Places_in_Harry_Potter#The_Leaky_Cauldron\" title=\"Places in Harry Potter\">Leaky Cauldron</a>, while being escorted by Hagrid to <a href=\"/wiki/Diagon_Alley\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Diagon Alley\">Diagon Alley</a> to shop for school supplies. Quirrell is next seen at Hogwarts conversing with Snape at the start-of-term banquet, and then regularly while teaching Defence Against the Dark Arts lessons. During the school's Halloween banquet, Quirrell appears in the Great Hall to warn staff and students of a troll in the dungeons and then he faints, so he can freely make his way to the third-floor corridor where <a href=\"/wiki/Magical_objects_in_Harry_Potter#Philosopher&#39;s_Stone\" title=\"Magical objects in Harry Potter\">the Stone</a> is hidden. Snape who, apparently, already suspected Quirrell was up to something, goes to the third floor in order to stop him.  In later novels, the readers learn that Dumbledore had told Snape to keep an eye on the DADA (<a href=\"/wiki/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Defence Against the Dark Arts\">Defence Against the Dark Arts</a>) professor. Quirrell is unable to get to the Stone, but in the process, Snape is bitten by <a href=\"/wiki/Fluffy_(Harry_Potter)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Fluffy (Harry Potter)\">Fluffy</a>.  When Harry and his friends see that Snape has been bitten, they begin to suspect Snape is after the Stone for himself.  While playing <a href=\"/wiki/Quidditch\" title=\"Quidditch\">Quidditch</a>, Harry is almost thrown off his broom by some sort of curse and he, Ron, and Hermione believe it is Snape who is responsible. They begin to suspect that Snape is trying to steal the Stone hidden in a secret chamber in Hogwarts; however, when Harry finally arrives in the chamber, he discovers that it is not Snape, but Quirrell, who is the real villain.\n</p><p>During his European travels, Quirrell discovered the barely-alive Voldemort, who had been in hiding since his failed bid to kill Harry as an infant.  Quirrell became attracted to Voldemort's offers of power, and returned to Britain with the Dark Lord.  Quirrell addresses and refers to Lord Voldemort by that name, rather than \"The Dark Lord\" as other Death Eaters do. Initially, Voldemort allowed Quirrell to act autonomously \u2013 Quirrell was able to shake hands with Harry in the Leaky Cauldron, and was not wearing the turban, meaning that Voldemort was not possessing him (though this changes in the film version, where Quirrell wears the turban at the Leaky Cauldron and refuses to shake Harry's hand). Voldemort first used Quirrell in a plan to steal the Philosopher's Stone from its vault in <a href=\"/wiki/Gringotts_Bank\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Gringotts Bank\">Gringotts Bank</a>, where it had been deposited for safekeeping by Dumbledore. But Dumbledore had already sent <a href=\"/wiki/Hagrid\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hagrid\">Hagrid</a> on a mission to retrieve the Stone, which he did while he and Harry were shopping in Diagon Alley, after they met with Quirrell in the Leaky Cauldron.\n</p><p>Voldemort, as punishment for Quirrell's failure to secure the Stone from Gringotts, decided to keep a closer watch on his new servant.  He took possession of Quirrell's body, which caused his face to appear on the back of Quirrell's bald head.  To conceal this, Quirrell took to wearing the <a href=\"/wiki/Turban\" title=\"Turban\">turban</a>.  To keep Voldemort alive, Quirrell had to kill unicorns in the <a href=\"/wiki/Hogwarts_layout#Forbidden_Forest\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hogwarts layout\">Forbidden Forest</a>, drinking their blood to provide temporary life-sustaining powers for Voldemort. Quirrell then reveals that he was the one who let in the troll and attempted to throw Harry off his broom while Snape muttered a counter curse. During the climax of the story, as Harry and Quirrell try to recover the Stone from the <a href=\"/wiki/Mirror_of_Erised\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Mirror of Erised\">Mirror of Erised</a>, Voldemort reveals himself on the back of Quirrell's head, formerly concealed by the turban, and speaks directly to Harry, threatening to kill him if he does not assist Voldemort in recovering it. After Harry refuses, Quirrell tries to take the Stone by force. Voldemort orders Quirrell to attack Harry, who holds off Quirrell long enough for aid in the form of Dumbledore to arrive, at which point Voldemort flees, in his non-physical form. Voldemort's departure, as well as the agony suffered by him because of his contact with Harry, who continues to be protected by the love of his mother and the spell that was cast by her sacrificing her life to save Harry, causes Quirrell to die, hence Dumbledore's comment that Voldemort is as merciless to <a href=\"/wiki/Death_Eaters\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Death Eaters\">his followers</a> as to his enemies.\n</p><p>Before he dies, Quirrell tells Harry of the rivalry between his father, the late <a href=\"/wiki/Order_of_the_Phoenix_(organisation)#James_Potter\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Order of the Phoenix (organisation)\">James Potter</a>, and Snape: \"Didn't you know? Snape went to school with your father. They loathed each other.\"\n</p><p>The film version's climax ends a little differently: As Quirrell attacks him, Harry's blood protection, which was provided by his mother's sacrifice of her own life to save him, enables Harry to kill Quirrell himself. Harry discovers that when he comes into direct contact with Quirrell, it immediately produces a burning effect. In the final attack, Harry lays his hands on Quirrell, who burns into crumbling ash. The spirit form of Voldemort renders Harry unconscious before making his escape.\n</p><p>Though Quirrel's first name was never mentioned in the novels, the character is given the first name \"Quirinus\" in the official Harry Potter Trading Card Game.\n</p><p>British actor <a href=\"/wiki/Ian_Hart\" title=\"Ian Hart\">Ian Hart</a> portrayed Quirrell in <a href=\"/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher%27s_Stone_(film)\" title=\"Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#39;s Stone (film)\">the film adaptation of the book</a>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Horace_Slughorn\">Horace Slughorn</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Hogwarts_staff&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: Horace Slughorn\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><b>Horace Slughorn</b> is the long-serving Potions teacher and Head of Slytherin House since at least the 1940s, until his retirement after the 1981\u201382 school year. Following his retirement and the resurgence of Voldemort, Slughorn goes into hiding, concealing all knowledge of his whereabouts from both sides in the growing conflict in the wizarding world. However, after moving Snape to <a href=\"/wiki/Subjects_at_Hogwarts#Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Subjects at Hogwarts\">Defence Against the Dark Arts</a>, Dumbledore locates Slughorn and uses Harry as incentive to convince him to return to teaching Potions. Slughorn is described as preferring to be a \"<a href=\"/wiki/Back-seat_driver\" title=\"Back-seat driver\">back-seat driver</a>\", obtaining things he desires by using his contacts, particularly students whom he has invited into the \"Slug Club\", a group of students favoured by Slughorn, based either on their connections to important people (a type of <a href=\"/wiki/Cronyism\" title=\"Cronyism\">cronyism</a>) or on his belief that they have talents that will make them important and famous themselves when they leave school (<a href=\"/wiki/Meritocracy\" title=\"Meritocracy\">meritocracy</a>). He is one of the first Slytherin characters to defy the house's <a href=\"/wiki/Stereotype\" title=\"Stereotype\">stereotype</a> and being portrayed in a somewhat positive light: while he is self-serving and not above bending rules, he lacks the near-amorality and underhandedness that had, until that point, been a hallmark of the house. He does not resent blood status in general, and admits a pleasurable surprise when he comes upon a talented Muggle-born, such as Hermione or, years before, Harry's mother <a href=\"/wiki/Lily_Potter\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Lily Potter\">Lily Potter</a>, one of his all-time favourite pupils. Also, Slughorn notably displays not pride, but shame at having helped a young <a href=\"/wiki/Lord_Voldemort\" title=\"Lord Voldemort\">Tom Marvolo Riddle</a> perform some of his most noted and impressive feats of magic, as Riddle had questioned Slughorn about <a href=\"/wiki/Horcrux\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Horcrux\">Horcruxes</a>. However, students he deems unimportant he ignores, as though they were not there.\n</p><p>In <i>Half-Blood Prince</i>, Harry is invited to the first meeting of the Slug Club held on the <a href=\"/wiki/Hogwarts_Express\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hogwarts Express\">Hogwarts Express</a>. Slughorn sets less-stringent entry criteria for Advanced Potions than his predecessor, lowering the required grade from a perfect O (Outstanding) to the above-average E (Exceeds Expectations). This last-minute change enables Harry and Ron to take Potions at NEWT level. However, since Harry had not expected to be allowed to join the course, he has none of the necessary materials, and Slughorn lends him an old textbook until Harry can procure his own. Later, Harry does buy a new copy of Advanced Potion-Making from Flourish and Blotts, but switches the covers and gives back the new book. During his first class, Slughorn offers a small amount of <a href=\"/wiki/Felix_Felicis\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Felix Felicis\">Felix Felicis</a> to the student who brews the best cauldron of the Draught of Living Death. Harry wins with the help of handwritten notes in the borrowed textbook, which had once belonged to Snape, unbeknownst to him. When Ron falls victim to a high-strength love potion, Slughorn administers an antidote, but then nearly kills him with a drink of poisoned mead, not knowing that the bottle had been planted by <a href=\"/wiki/Draco_Malfoy\" title=\"Draco Malfoy\">Draco Malfoy</a> in an attempt to kill Dumbledore. Harry later uses the Felix Felicis to help retrieve a memory from Slughorn that details the conversation between the professor and Riddle about Horcruxes as well as the possibility of creating more than one Horcrux.\n</p><p>In <i><a href=\"/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows\" title=\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</a></i>, Slughorn briefly appears with other teachers assembling to fight Death Eaters. As Snape is now Headmaster, Slughorn has again assumed the post of Head of Slytherin. Though he is initially hesitant to join in the <a href=\"/wiki/Battle_of_Hogwarts\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Battle of Hogwarts\">Battle of Hogwarts</a> and is assumed to have evacuated with his house, he returns to the fray later on. It is revealed that he has not fled, but has recruited a large number of reinforcements to fight for Hogwarts.

She is described as a dumpy little witch with flyaway grey hair who wears a patched, frayed hat and shabby robes, often covered in dirt due to the time she spends tending plants in the Hogwarts greenhouses. Sprout is introduced in <i>Philosopher's Stone</i>, but she plays no active role until <i>Chamber of Secrets</i>, in which she teaches her second year students to work with Mandrake plants. She is responsible for raising the Mandrakes to full maturity, at which point their juice is used to revive the <a href=\"/wiki/Petrification\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Petrification\">petrified</a> victims of the <a href=\"/wiki/Magical_creatures_(Harry_Potter)#Basilisk\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Magical creatures (Harry Potter)\">basilisk</a>.\n</p><p>Sprout subsequently appears in <i>Goblet of Fire</i> in which, as the Hufflepuff Head of House, she comforts <a href=\"/wiki/Ministry_of_Magic#Others\" title=\"Ministry of Magic\">Amos Diggory</a> and his wife after the death of their son, Hufflepuff student <a href=\"/wiki/Cedric_Diggory\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cedric Diggory\">Cedric Diggory</a>, whom she knew well. In <i>Order of the Phoenix</i>, Sprout is a non-vocal supporter of Harry's story about Voldemort's resurrection. Like many teachers at Hogwarts, she detests Umbridge's presence and does her best to disobey her. After the raid of Hogwarts in <i>Half-Blood Prince</i>, Sprout is a staunch advocate of keeping Hogwarts open. She also supports the suggestion that Dumbledore should be laid to rest at Hogwarts. Sprout attends Dumbledore's funeral, where she appears cleaner than she has ever been seen before.\n</p><p>In <i>Deathly Hallows</i>, she chases Snape away from Hogwarts with Professors McGonagall and Flitwick. Informed that Voldemort and his Death Eaters are coming to besiege Hogwarts, she uses her knowledge of magical plants by improvising offensive <a href=\"/wiki/Botany\" title=\"Botany\">botany</a>, and, with the help of several students, throws Mandrakes, Snargaluff pods, and Venomous Tentaculas off the castle walls at the approaching Death Eaters.

Trelawney is described as a slight woman resembling an insect, draped in a large <a href=\"/wiki/Sequin\" title=\"Sequin\">spangled</a> shawl and many gaudy bangles and rings. She speaks in a whispy voice and wears thick glasses, which cause her eyes to appear greatly magnified. Her odd classroom in the North Tower of Hogwarts is a cross between \"someone's attic and an old-fashioned tea shop\";<sup id=\"cite_ref-18\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-18\">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup> it can only be reached by climbing to the top of the stairs and then up a ladder through a trapdoor set in the ceiling. This dim, heavily scented, and \"stiflingly\" warm room often affects students' wakefulness.\n</p><p>Professor Trelawney first appears in the third book of the series, when Harry, Ron, and Hermione start divination lessons. The friends generally believe Professor Trelawney is a fraud. However, Gryffindor students <a href=\"/wiki/Dumbledore%27s_Army#Parvati_Patil\" title=\"Dumbledore&#39;s Army\">Parvati Patil</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Dumbledore%27s_Army#Lavender_Brown\" title=\"Dumbledore&#39;s Army\">Lavender Brown</a> are very fond of and impressed by her. According to Professor McGonagall, her credibility as a Seer is undermined by her habit of erroneously predicting, each year, the death of one of her students. Her more profound predictions seem only to happen when she is in a <a href=\"/wiki/Trance\" title=\"Trance\">trance</a> and unaware of what she is saying, with no memory of it afterward. However, almost all her predictions were later shown to be true in the books even if she was not in a trance.\n</p><p>Prior to the events of the <i>Harry Potter</i> books, Professor Trelawney falls into a prophetic trance while in an interview with Dumbledore at the <a href=\"/wiki/Places_in_Harry_Potter#The_Hog&#39;s_Head\" title=\"Places in Harry Potter\">Hog's Head</a>, making a prophecy about the birth of a wizard \"with the power to vanquish\" Voldemort. This prophecy was partly overheard by Snape, who relayed what he heard to Voldemort. This led Voldemort to attack the Potter family, believing that Harry was the child named. In <i>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</i>, Professor Trelawney prophesies to Harry about the events of the book's climax. In <i>Order of the Phoenix</i>, Professor Trelawney is first put on probation by Umbridge, and later fired. However, Professor Trelawney continues to reside in Hogwarts castle due to an order by Dumbledore, who believes that she would be in danger outside Hogwarts due to the prophecy she made during her interview. Dumbledore later reveals that the prophecy is why he keeps her employed as a Divination teacher. Professor Trelawney returns to teaching in <i>Half-Blood Prince</i>, but has to share classes with <a href=\"/wiki/Magical_creatures_in_Harry_Potter#Centaurs\" title=\"Magical creatures in Harry Potter\">Firenze</a>, as he was cast out by his fellow <a href=\"/wiki/Magical_creatures_in_Harry_Potter#Centaurs\" title=\"Magical creatures in Harry Potter\">centaurs</a> when he agreed to replace Professor Trelawney after she was fired, which she thinks is an outrage. In <i><a href=\"/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows\" title=\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</a></i>, she is seen aiding in the Battle of Hogwarts by magically accelerating her crystal balls at Death Eaters.
