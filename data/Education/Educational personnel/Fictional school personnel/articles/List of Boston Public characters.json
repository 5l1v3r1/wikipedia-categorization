Throughout the series, Steven remained the most consistent character on the show, and its strongest presence and focal point. Considered one of the most important characters in the show, he was consistently the school's leader, handling teachers and students with problems; much of his character revolved around his pride in the teaching profession and his loyalty to the kids and the faculty.\n</p><p>Little is known about Steven's past, but there are suggestions that he was a rebellious youth during his teenage years. He mentions in one episode that he crashed a car into a tree while drunk, and reveals in another episode that, when he was 14, he and some friends <a href=\"/wiki/Robbery\" title=\"Robbery\">robbed</a> a <a href=\"/wiki/Convenience_store\" title=\"Convenience store\">convenience store</a>, but when one of his teachers found out and didn't report him to the police, Steven began to turn his life around. This, years later, allowed Steven to admire, more or less, teachers who stopped at nothing to help their students. It is also mentioned that Steven played <a href=\"/wiki/American_football\" title=\"American football\">football</a> in high school.\n</p><p>Steven was married to a woman named Louanna, but they <a href=\"/wiki/Divorce\" title=\"Divorce\">divorced</a>. During Season 2, Brooke, Steven's rebellious, <a href=\"/wiki/American_liberalism\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"American liberalism\">liberal</a> activist teenage daughter, gets transferred to Winslow High after being expelled from her <a href=\"/wiki/Private_school\" title=\"Private school\">private school</a> when an <a href=\"/wiki/Animal_rights\" title=\"Animal rights\">animal rights</a> protest goes wrong. Steven manages to build a relationship with Brooke and his estranged ex-wife, who later goes on to date another man. By the end of Season 3, Brooke had been written out of the series, as she had graduated and was accepted to <a href=\"/wiki/Harvard_University\" title=\"Harvard University\">Harvard University</a>. Once the show's fourth and final season began, Steven embarked on a relationship with Marilyn Sudor, which caused some friction between him and Scott Guber, who had become attracted to Marylin.\n</p><p>Steven appeared in a 2005 episode of <i><a href=\"/wiki/Boston_Legal\" title=\"Boston Legal\">Boston Legal</a></i> titled \"Let Sales Ring\", when a student sued Winslow High for <a href=\"/wiki/Censorship\" title=\"Censorship\">censoring</a> a news network (that was clearly <a href=\"/wiki/Fox_News_Channel\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Fox News Channel\">Fox News Channel</a>, though never explicitly identified as such). He also appeared on Boston Legal's parent show, <a href=\"/wiki/The_Practice\" title=\"The Practice\">The Practice</a>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Lauren_Davis\">Lauren Davis</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=List_of_Boston_Public_characters&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Lauren Davis\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><b>Lauren Davis</b>, played by <a href=\"/wiki/Jessalyn_Gilsig\" title=\"Jessalyn Gilsig\">Jessalyn Gilsig</a> (Seasons 1-2), was one of the two <a href=\"/wiki/Social_studies\" title=\"Social studies\">social studies</a> teachers in Season 1. She earned the nickname \"The Nun\" because of her strait-laced ways. By Season 2, when the ostensibly hipper Ronnie Cooke appeared, Lauren's character changed, making her what her colleagues called a \"<a href=\"/wiki/Prima_donna\" title=\"Prima donna\">prima donna</a> perfectionist.\" In Season 1, Steven felt that she was being <a href=\"/wiki/Racism\" title=\"Racism\">racist</a> because she was tougher on her <a href=\"/wiki/African-American\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"African-American\">African-American</a> students, an accusation she was willing to consider in order to save Harvey from being fired.\n</p><p>Lauren briefly dated Harry, but broke up with him, in what was Season 1's biggest romance. Later, she began dating Daniel Evans, an alumnus who was found to be a <a href=\"/wiki/Stalking\" title=\"Stalking\">stalker</a>. She carried a <a href=\"/wiki/Gun\" title=\"Gun\">gun</a> to protect herself and was suspended for a summer session.\n</p><p>During Season 2, Lauren was shocked when some of her students were hospitalized because they were so stressed out about her work assignments. Scott had a crush on Lauren, a relationship that never seemed to go anywhere until right before Lauren was written out of the show.\n</p><p>When the third season premiered, Gilsig had left the show, and it was mentioned that Lauren had left Winslow High for a job at a <a href=\"/wiki/Private_school\" title=\"Private school\">private school</a>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Marla_Hendricks\">Marla Hendricks</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=List_of_Boston_Public_characters&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Marla Hendricks\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><b>Marla Hendricks</b>, played by <a href=\"/wiki/Loretta_Devine\" title=\"Loretta Devine\">Loretta Devine</a>, was a <a href=\"/wiki/Social_studies\" title=\"Social studies\">social studies</a> teacher who suffered from severe <a href=\"/wiki/Bipolar_disorder\" title=\"Bipolar disorder\">bipolar manic depression</a>, the effects of which were mainly only seen in Season 1. She had to take pills to make it through a stressful day, which seemed to be just about every day.\n</p><p>Marla was occasionally depicted as a vocally religious woman, encouraging students to <a href=\"/wiki/School_prayer\" title=\"School prayer\">pray on school grounds</a> and running a gospel choir. She was also frequently the one to give lectures to other faculty members, parents or students about the financial and emotional challenges facing teachers, along with other topical issues such as <a href=\"/wiki/Bullying\" title=\"Bullying\">bullying</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Multiculturalism\" title=\"Multiculturalism\">multiculturalism</a>, and the usage of the word \"<a href=\"/wiki/Nigger\" title=\"Nigger\">nigger</a>/<a href=\"/wiki/Nigga\" title=\"Nigga\">nigga</a>\" by <a href=\"/wiki/White_people\" title=\"White people\">white people</a>.\n</p><p>On the other hand, on many occasions, Marla was depicted, like Danny and Harvey, as someone who did not think before she spoke. She was vocal and no-nonsense, and often insulted teachers, students and even Steven when they needed it, or sometimes just because she needed it. Scott once accused her of being too emotional on too many different issues to the point it diluted her potency as an advocate. Marla's bold personality kept her from advancing into administration when she insulted the concept of <a href=\"/wiki/Standardized_testing\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Standardized testing\">standardized testing</a> during a job interview for vice principal. In Season 3, Marla had a brief relationship with a political advocate played by <a href=\"/wiki/Vern_Troyer\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Vern Troyer\">Vern Troyer</a>.\n</p><p>In Season 4, Marla decided to have a baby, and asked Steven if he would consider donating his <a href=\"/wiki/Sperm\" title=\"Sperm\">sperm</a>. When Steven refused, she continued to try to get pregnant but failed, suffering a <a href=\"/wiki/Miscarriage\" title=\"Miscarriage\">miscarriage</a>, but later got the chance of experiencing motherhood when she took in a troubled student named Rainy.\n</p><p>Overall, Marla was considered an excellent and compassionate teacher, adept at reaching kids and parents. Like the other faculty members, her personal foibles sometimes got in her way, but she was, overall, there for the kids and her colleagues.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Scott_Guber\">Scott Guber</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=List_of_Boston_Public_characters&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Scott Guber\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><b>Scott Guber</b>, played by <a href=\"/wiki/Anthony_Heald\" title=\"Anthony Heald\">Anthony Heald</a>, is the <a href=\"/wiki/Vice_principal\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Vice principal\">vice principal</a> who was forced to play the disciplinary \"bad cop\" to both the students and faculty. As someone who grew up bullied because his peers mistakenly thought he was <a href=\"/wiki/Homosexuality\" title=\"Homosexuality\">gay</a>, Scott treated <a href=\"/wiki/Bigotry\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Bigotry\">bigotry</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Bullying\" title=\"Bullying\">bullying</a> as serious a crime as <a href=\"/wiki/Truancy\" title=\"Truancy\">cutting class</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Cheating\" title=\"Cheating\">cheating</a> on an exam. On the other hand, some episodes had him seriously bullying teachers with a condescending, managerial tone that caused them to dislike him. In fact, the students saw him as so tough they labeled him \"The <a href=\"/wiki/Nazi\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Nazi\">Nazi</a>\" in spite of the fact that Scott is <a href=\"/wiki/Judaism\" title=\"Judaism\">Jewish</a>. However, Scott's dedication to Winslow High and its students was eventually noted in the first-season finale when the kids gave him a special award.\n</p><p>It is strongly indicated that Scott's father died several years ago; his single mother, Miriam, appears in Season 3 and goes out on a date with Harvey. Scott also has an older brother named George, who is a high-priced <a href=\"/wiki/Lawyer\" title=\"Lawyer\">lawyer</a>; he became estranged from his brother when George set Scott up on a date with a masseuse who turned out to be a <a href=\"/wiki/Call_girl\" title=\"Call girl\">call girl</a>.\n</p><p>Scott's ongoing goal was to one day become a principal himself, a goal he pursued in Season 1, which was also devoted to his growing dislike for being the \"bad guy\" to Steven's \"good guy.\" He was disappointed to receive an unfavorable recommendation from Steven, who said he wasn't ready and was too autocratic to be a principal. Over the next seasons, Scott and Steven would sometimes wrangle over the boundaries between their two jobs, but their friendship was key to the both of them and to the show.\n</p><p>Scott's love of <a href=\"/wiki/Classical_music\" title=\"Classical music\">classical music</a>, composing and conducting was a staple of the character's off-duty time and occasionally allowed for storylines. His romantic life, unlike Steven's, was often fodder for storylines on the show. In Season 1, Scott pursued Lauren to the point she called it <a href=\"/wiki/Harassment\" title=\"Harassment\">harassment</a>, and later asked Marilyn Sudor out, leaving Lauren and Marilyn to conclude that he asked out any woman who was nice to him. This tendency came to a head in Season 2 when Scott began an ill-advised relationship with the duplicitous Meredith Peters who, in Season 1, locked her son Jeremy in the basement. Jeremy returned the favor, and she escaped only by <a href=\"/wiki/Chainsaw\" title=\"Chainsaw\">chainsaw</a>, severing her hand in the process and gaining the nickname \"Hook Lady.\" The relationship was filled with ups and downs. Scott's attempts to get on Jeremy's good side were occasionally chronicled, including his sensitivity to Jeremy's <a href=\"/wiki/Bisexuality\" title=\"Bisexuality\">bisexuality</a>. Both characters basically disappeared after Scott separated from the erratic and pathological Meredith late in Season 2.\n</p><p>At the end of Season 2, Scott took up with Lauren, but as she didn't come back for Season 3, we never learned how that relationship ended. By the end of Season 3, however, Scott had increased his level of friendship with Marilyn through dancing lessons, and by Season 4, he was pursuing her. Marilyn rejected his advances, as she was seeing Steven. Weeks later, Scott found love in Violet Montgomery, a former <a href=\"/wiki/Adult_film_actress\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Adult film actress\">adult film actress</a> turned free spirit who shared his taste in music and agreed to date him exclusively.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Marilyn_Sudor\">Marilyn Sudor</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=List_of_Boston_Public_characters&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Marilyn Sudor\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><b>Marilyn Sudor</b>, played by <a href=\"/wiki/Sharon_Leal\" title=\"Sharon Leal\">Sharon Leal</a>, was the music instructor and an <a href=\"/wiki/English_language\" title=\"English language\">English</a> teacher. One of the most attractive teachers in the school, Marilyn was often the listed as the teacher the \"boys most wanted to sleep with\" in a yearly student poll.\n</p><p>Student storylines had her involved with Tyronn Anderson (a gang member whom Harry was covering for), Jeremy Peters (who was being locked in the basement by his mother), and Aisha (a young talented singer who needed to break up with her abusive boyfriend). Marilyn admitted in Season 3 that she too had been in an abusive relationship with an ex-husband who showed up for an <a href=\"/wiki/Annulment\" title=\"Annulment\">annulment</a> in Season 4.\n</p><p>Romantically, Marilyn joined with Scott to take some <a href=\"/wiki/Dancing\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Dancing\">dancing</a> lessons, but was quick to assert that they were going to just be friends. She dated a <a href=\"/wiki/Basketball\" title=\"Basketball\">basketball</a> coach who turned out to be in coaching to advance his college coaching chances. In the final season, she began dating Steven, and their romance became public after a student faced suspension for kissing Marilyn at a scholarship awards ceremony threatened to go before the school board because he felt that he was suspended for kissing the principal's girlfriend; eventually, Steven agreed to reduce the student's punishment so that it would not cause him to lose his scholarship or hurt his college application process.\n</p><p>Marilyn was also involved in many of the musical numbers the show employed, singing at school concerts, doing a singing trio with Louisa and Marla, and working with young musicians. She was known for being by-the-book, compassionate, and straightforward, but also rather enigmatic and sort of a utility player a lot of the time.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Harvey_Lipschultz\">Harvey Lipschultz</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=List_of_Boston_Public_characters&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Harvey Lipschultz\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><b>Harvey Lipschultz</b>, played by <a href=\"/wiki/Fyvush_Finkel\" title=\"Fyvush Finkel\">Fyvush Finkel</a>, was a history teacher. Harvey was a somewhat <a href=\"/wiki/Stereotype\" title=\"Stereotype\">stereotypical</a> elderly <a href=\"/wiki/Judaism\" title=\"Judaism\">Jewish</a> man. He was not a fan of <a href=\"/wiki/Political_correctness\" title=\"Political correctness\">political correctness</a>, and his character seemed to switch from being a well-meaning old man that once met with the school's <a href=\"/wiki/American_football\" title=\"American football\">football</a> team to ask them not to <a href=\"/wiki/Discrimination\" title=\"Discrimination\">discriminate</a> against a player who was rumored to be <a href=\"/wiki/Homosexuality\" title=\"Homosexuality\">gay</a>, while other times he came off as an <a href=\"/wiki/Archie_Bunker\" title=\"Archie Bunker\">Archie Bunker</a>-type <a href=\"/wiki/Bigot\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Bigot\">bigot</a> or a simple comical buffoon of a bygone era.\n</p><p>As a young man, Harvey served in <a href=\"/wiki/World_War_II\" title=\"World War II\">World War II</a>. On the night before he left to go to <a href=\"/wiki/Europe\" title=\"Europe\">Europe</a>, he had a <a href=\"/wiki/One-night_stand\" title=\"One-night stand\">one-night stand</a> with an <a href=\"/wiki/African-American\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"African-American\">African-American</a> \"lady of the evening\" who later gave birth to a son named Lester who, at the age of sixty, was able to track down Harvey and introduce him to his family, including Lester's children and grandchildren. After the war, Harvey came home and married a woman named Helen, and remained faithful to her until she died, although she did have an affair. He frequently reflected back on Helen, who died shortly before the series began. In Season 3, a stock dip erased Harvey's life savings.\n</p><p>Often threatening to retire and also threatened with being fired, Harvey was able to continue working after he agreed to attend racial sensitivity classes in Season 1, and in Season 3, was barely saved from retirement by some last-minute budget restructuring.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Ronnie_Cooke\">Ronnie Cooke</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=List_of_Boston_Public_characters&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Ronnie Cooke\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><b>Ronnie Cooke</b>, played by <a href=\"/wiki/Jeri_Ryan\" title=\"Jeri Ryan\">Jeri Ryan</a> (Seasons 2-4), was a college friend of Harry's, a successful and wealthy <a href=\"/wiki/Corporate_law\" title=\"Corporate law\">corporate lawyer</a> who decided that her true calling in life was to teach at a public high school. As a lawyer, Ronnie often acted as a legal advocate for students in what some argued were completely unrealistic and \"off-topic\" situations. She handled at least two <a href=\"/wiki/Murder\" title=\"Murder\">murder</a>-related trials (one for Steven, one for some students). Other times, the stories fit the school: One of her first actions as a teacher was to help Danny organize his students to sue Harvey for emotional abuse, and also helped students get out of various legal jams.\n</p><p>Ronnie briefly dated Harry until he left the show early in Season 3. She then began an on-and-off relationship with Zach Fischer, and accepted a position from Dave Fields, the mayor's liaison, to be Winslow High's new assistant principal after she impressed the school board with her testing techniques. This made Marla, the other candidate for the job, jealous, and angered Scott, who saw Ronnie as a glory-hound putting her own political interests above the needs of the students. Zach became jealous of the mayor's liaison, who clearly liked Ronnie. Eventually, Ronnie and Scott came to an understanding, and were able to avoid budget cuts by cutting all funding on varsity sports. Marla moved on, and Zach became a <a href=\"/wiki/Buddhist\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Buddhist\">Buddhist</a>. By Season 4, Ronnie has stepped down from her position as vice principal and became the school guidance counselor.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Danny_Hanson\">Danny Hanson</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=List_of_Boston_Public_characters&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: Danny Hanson\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><b>Daniel 'Danny' Hanson</b>, played by <a href=\"/wiki/Michael_Rapaport\" title=\"Michael Rapaport\">Michael Rapaport</a> (Seasons 2-4), was some kind of <a href=\"/wiki/Humanities\" title=\"Humanities\">humanities</a> teacher who was introduced at the beginning of Season 2. He came from a <a href=\"/wiki/Working-class\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Working-class\">working-class</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Irish_people\" title=\"Irish people\">Irish</a>-<a href=\"/wiki/Catholic\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Catholic\">Catholic</a> home, and had a <a href=\"/wiki/Populism\" title=\"Populism\">populist</a> political philosophy and a certain ambivalence about <a href=\"/wiki/Religion\" title=\"Religion\">religion</a>, declaring he didn't believe in <a href=\"/wiki/God\" title=\"God\">God</a> during the fourth season. This was due to him being <a href=\"/wiki/Child_molestation\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Child molestation\">sexually molested</a> by his priest, Father Bill Egan, when he was a child. Danny also had a <a href=\"/wiki/American_conservatism\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"American conservatism\">conservative</a> side when it came to <a href=\"/wiki/Race_(classification_of_human_beings)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Race (classification of human beings)\">race</a>, and didn't like the \"<a href=\"/wiki/Sacred_cow_(idiom)\" title=\"Sacred cow (idiom)\">sacred cow</a>\" status some racial issues were given. Later in Season 2, he began a debate about the word \"<a href=\"/wiki/Nigger\" title=\"Nigger\">nigger</a>\" in Winslow High. Marla correctly suggested that Danny's main flaw wasn't being controversial, but raising questions that he didn't have any helpful solutions to. Danny and Marla fought a lot (including one fist-fight early in Season 3), but also admitted they had a lot in common.\n</p><p>Like Marla, Danny's hot-headed attitude got him into trouble in both his professional and personal life. To name a few examples, when he walked in on his fianc\u00e9 having sex with another man, Danny threw a phone at the man. Later, he sent letters to the parents of <a href=\"/wiki/Obesity\" title=\"Obesity\">overweight</a> students advising them to watch their children's <a href=\"/wiki/Junk_food\" title=\"Junk food\">junk food</a> intake over the summer; one of the students punched him for that.\n</p><p>On the upside, Danny helped students with various issues, including a kid who had been molested by the same priest who hurt Danny, and a 12-year-old <a href=\"/wiki/Genius\" title=\"Genius\">genius</a>. He also had a special relationship with overachieving Debbie Nixon in Season 2, which came under scrutiny but turned out to be a healthy teacher/student mentorship.\n</p><p>In the series' third season, Danny began dating Claire Ellison, whom he eventually married, and gained custody of Allison, his 5-year-old niece, while Joanie, his sister, was in <a href=\"/wiki/Drug_rehabilitation\" title=\"Drug rehabilitation\">rehab</a> for <a href=\"/wiki/Drug_addiction\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Drug addiction\">drug addiction</a>. By Season 4, the marriage was faltering, and Joanie came back for Allison (which is rather legally dubious as they had legally adopted her).

A teacher who was assigned to teach in the infamous \"Dungeon\" after Marla walks out on the class in the pilot episode when dealing with the disruptive students there overwhelmed her, Harry specialized in using his own dark side to reach kids on the edge.\n</p><p>Possessed of a sarcastic <a href=\"/wiki/Sense_of_humor\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sense of humor\">sense of humor</a>, Harry was infamous for deploying unusual (and often dangerous) methods to try and reach his students, such as firing a <a href=\"/wiki/Gun\" title=\"Gun\">gun</a> off in the Dungeon in an effort to teach the unruly students there a lesson in respect, agreeing to become the faculty sponsor for a student branch of the <a href=\"/wiki/National_Rifle_Association\" title=\"National Rifle Association\">National Rifle Association</a> only to later deliver a disparaging speech against the organization (which he linked to an <a href=\"/wiki/United_States_of_America\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"United States of America\">American</a> glorification of <a href=\"/wiki/Gun_violence\" title=\"Gun violence\">gun violence</a>), and starting up a \"Suicide Club\" to get kids to open up about their <a href=\"/wiki/Suicide\" title=\"Suicide\">suicidal</a> feelings.\n</p><p>In an early Season 1 storyline, Harry was kissed by a student, Dana Poole, who later <a href=\"/wiki/Blackmail\" title=\"Blackmail\">blackmailed</a> him. He almost lost his job for this and his other radical antics, one being withholding knowledge that a student, Tyronn Anderson, had killed a rival gang member in <a href=\"/wiki/Self-defense\" title=\"Self-defense\">self-defense</a>. However, Harry's great <a href=\"/wiki/Compassion\" title=\"Compassion\">compassion</a> and ability to persuade his students to never give up and do the right thing ultimately saved his job, though he continued to come into conflict with Scott and Steven over his controversial methods.\n</p><p>Harry began a relationship with Lauren. The two initially seemed happy until Lauren began to feel that Harry wasn't really opening up to her; they subsequently broke up shortly after Harry confided in Lauren that he knew Tyronn killed someone. Harry's more serious relationship was with Ronnie Cooke in Seasons 2 and 3. Ronnie had initially been brought in by Harry to talk about her job as a big-time lawyer, but she was so impressed by Harry's handling of students that she signed up as a teacher.\n</p><p>In the second-season finale, Harry was stabbed by a former student and almost died. It took the near-death of Harry Senate for the rest of the faculty to realize how much they had come to love Harry as more than a colleague, but also as a close friend. Initially, Harry was supposed to die from his wounds; this was <a href=\"/wiki/David_E._Kelley\" title=\"David E. Kelley\">David E. Kelley</a>'s way of writing Nicky Katt out of the show so that he could pursue a movie career. When Katt became available again, but for only a part of the next season, Kelley and his writers allowed Harry to survive the attack, only to suffer from a slow <a href=\"/wiki/Mental_breakdown\" title=\"Mental breakdown\">mental breakdown</a> that would ultimately provide Katt with a very different exit from the show.\n</p><p>A combination of <a href=\"/wiki/Post-traumatic_stress\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Post-traumatic stress\">post-traumatic stress</a> (as a result of the stabbing) and his inability to \"save\" some of his most troubled students prompted Harry's breakdown as he displayed increasingly unpredictable behavior, such as taking off for <a href=\"/wiki/Florida\" title=\"Florida\">Florida</a> on an unapproved leave of absence, harboring a teenage <a href=\"/wiki/Prostitute\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Prostitute\">prostitute</a> and her young son, yelling at his students for not completing their homework, and getting rough with Ronnie while <a href=\"/wiki/Sexual_intercourse\" title=\"Sexual intercourse\">making love</a> with her. Given the choice of being fired or taking a <a href=\"/wiki/Sabbatical\" title=\"Sabbatical\">sabbatical</a>, Harry was dismayed, but realized that his current mental state was affecting his unique ability as a teacher. He chose to take a leave of absence to get himself together, promising that he would someday return. As he walked out of the building, Harry gave newly arrived teacher Kimberly Woods some good advice.\n</p><p>Kelley admitted that Harry's choice to take a leave of absence was a way of allowing for his eventual return should Katt become available again; the show's premature cancellation prevented the possibility.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Minor_characters\">Minor characters</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=List_of_Boston_Public_characters&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11\" title=\"Edit section: Minor characters\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Other_teachers\">Other teachers</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=List_of_Boston_Public_characters&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12\" title=\"Edit section: Other teachers\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In the third season, three new teachers were hired.

Zach seemed to be a replacement for Harry, except with no mysterious personal demons. He didn't deal with the same on-edge kids, but was very well liked by students who dubbed him \"Fish.\" He soon began to date Ronnie until they broke up and he became a <a href=\"/wiki/Buddhist\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Buddhist\">Buddhist</a> (despite being <a href=\"/wiki/Judaism\" title=\"Judaism\">Jewish</a>). Colin had a brief affair with Patricia Emerson, the mother of Becky Emerson (who had a crush on him herself), but broke it off when a jealous Becky threatened to reveal the affair in a <a href=\"/wiki/Poem\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Poem\">poem</a> she was going to read in public.\n</p><p>The third character was <b>Kimberly Woods</b> (<a href=\"/wiki/Michelle_Monaghan\" title=\"Michelle Monaghan\">Michelle Monaghan</a>), a young and somewhat naive woman in a \"<a href=\"/wiki/Teach_for_America\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Teach for America\">Teach for America</a>\" program whose class discussion on <a href=\"/wiki/Affirmative_action\" title=\"Affirmative action\">affirmative action</a> results in racial violence that ended up putting Steven on trial for <a href=\"/wiki/Murder\" title=\"Murder\">murder</a>. Kimberly was later forced to leave Winslow High after an obsessed <a href=\"/wiki/Lesbian\" title=\"Lesbian\">lesbian</a> student stalked and threatened to kill her. Zach and Colin disappeared from the show after the third season with no explanation as to what happened to them.\n</p><p>In the fourth and final season, three new characters came onto the show.

(The storyline never brought up the controversial reality that <a href=\"/wiki/Massachusetts\" title=\"Massachusetts\">Massachusetts</a> schools have a state-mandated <a href=\"/wiki/English_language\" title=\"English language\">English</a>-only policy.) Carmen started a brief relationship with <b>Jake</b> (<a href=\"/wiki/Milo_Ventimiglia\" title=\"Milo Ventimiglia\">Milo Ventimiglia</a>), an undercover cop who was posing as a \"bad boy\" teenager in order to bring down a student who was selling drugs; Jake was murdered when the drug bust went wrong. In the meantime, she helped Jenn Cardell (<a href=\"/wiki/Lyndsy_Fonseca\" title=\"Lyndsy Fonseca\">Lyndsy Fonseca</a>), a student who also liked Jake and had a drinking problem. Carmen revealed her own drinking problem, but little was made of it. She also revealed her mother committed <a href=\"/wiki/Suicide\" title=\"Suicide\">suicide</a>.

Louisa learned of Milton's affair with Lisa and pondered ratting on him, but didn't; however, she did exhibit a spiteful attitude towards Lisa. In the second season, she was discovered to be secretly writing \"Dear Helen\", a sex advice column for the school newspaper, which almost led to her dismissal. Louisa came from a bi-racial family (her father was <a href=\"/wiki/African-American\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"African-American\">African-American</a> while her mother was <a href=\"/wiki/White_people\" title=\"White people\">Caucasian</a>). Before departing from the series, she started up an unofficial girl band with Marla and Marilyn.</li>\n<li><b>Milton Buttle</b> (<a href=\"/wiki/Joey_Slotnick\" title=\"Joey Slotnick\">Joey Slotnick</a>) was the nerdy and mild-mannered English teacher who was often on the receiving end of Sheryl Holt's online parodies. He met Lisa Grier at a <a href=\"/wiki/Starbucks\" title=\"Starbucks\">Starbucks</a> one day and started a relationship with her, only to find that she was a student at Winslow High. Despite this, he reluctantly continued his relationship with Lisa but was discovered and fired, though he continued dating Lisa. Her parents actually approved of their relationship.</li>\n<li><b>Kevin Riley</b> (<a href=\"/wiki/Tom_McCarthy_(director)\" title=\"Tom McCarthy (director)\">Tom McCarthy</a>) was the <a href=\"/wiki/American_football\" title=\"American football\">football</a> coach who was fired when he told Scott that he knew that about the secret affair between Milton and Lisa in an attempt to get Scott and Steven to go easy on Milton. Kevin sued to get his job back in an episode that crossed over with <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Practice\" title=\"The Practice\">The Practice</a></i>, but he lost his case and angrily snubbed Steven when he attempted to make peace with Kevin. The coach that replaced Kevin was a minor character who was rarely seen.</li>\n<li><b>Dr. Benjamin Harris</b> (<a href=\"/wiki/Leslie_Jordan\" title=\"Leslie Jordan\">Leslie Jordan</a>) was an effeminate <a href=\"/wiki/American_South\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"American South\">Southern</a> chemistry teacher who originated in the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Ally_McBeal\" title=\"Ally McBeal\">Ally McBeal</a></i> episode \"The Wedding.\" He first appeared when he helped Jeremy Peters dissect his mother's severed hand in the second-season premiere, then got into trouble when he organized a school production of <a href=\"/wiki/Susan_Miller_(playwright)\" title=\"Susan Miller (playwright)\">Susan Miller</a>'s <i>It's Our Town Too</i> that centered around <a href=\"/wiki/Homosexuality\" title=\"Homosexuality\">homosexuality</a>. Dr. Harris later resigned after he was discovered having had <a href=\"/wiki/Cybersex\" title=\"Cybersex\">cybersex</a> with two 18-year-old female Winslow students who had posed as college students in an <a href=\"/wiki/Internet\" title=\"Internet\">Internet</a> chatroom.</li>\n<li><b>Marsha Shinn</b> (<a href=\"/wiki/Debbi_Morgan\" title=\"Debbi Morgan\">Debbi Morgan</a>) was the judgmental and overly critical <a href=\"/wiki/Superintendent_(education)\" title=\"Superintendent (education)\">superintendent</a> who once visited the school to complain about the unorthodox teaching methods of the faculty in an attempt to get Steven fired after he physically assaulted a school bully in the pilot episode.

Unlike Shinn, she was less judgmental, and was persuaded by Steven to not suspend or fire Scott for his role in the student riot in the third-season premiere; she even half-jokingly told Steven to keep Scott from talking to the athletes.

Despite this, Harry reached out to her and tried to help her when she became a <a href=\"/wiki/Stripper\" title=\"Stripper\">stripper</a>. As a college student, Dana returned to interview the high school faculty and staff about the low teacher salaries and began to date Harry, only to later break up with him at his birthday party because he lied to his co-workers about how long their relationship had been going on.</li>\n<li><b>Lisa Grier</b> (<a href=\"/wiki/Bianca_Kajlich\" title=\"Bianca Kajlich\">Bianca Kajlich</a>) was a senior who got into a romantic affair with the English teacher Milton Buttle. This resulted in Buttle's dismissal and her getting scheduled for transfer to another school. Lisa also taught a Shakespeare class after the teacher of the class gave up teaching, and was allowed to continue due to a shortage of teachers in the aftermath of Kevin Riley's dismissal. She eventually didn't get transferred and graduated at the end of the first season.</li>\n<li><b>Susan Potter</b> (<a href=\"/wiki/Joanna_Garcia\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Joanna Garcia\">Joanna Garcia</a>) was a popular student who was caught giving <a href=\"/wiki/Oral_sex\" title=\"Oral sex\">oral sex</a> in the school hallway to sway a student election.</li>\n<li><b>Sheryl Holt</b> (<a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Lamya_Jezek&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Lamya Jezek (page does not exist)\">Lamya Jezek</a>) was the editor of the student newspaper and webmaster of an online website, Holt 45. The website was a frequent problem for the faculty, as it often spoofed them and their private lives with graphic innuendos. Though usually a source of stress and conflict for the staff, Sheryl was sometimes sought out for information. The school eventually took her to court for the humiliating publishings on her website but lost the case. She was eventually set straight by Scott when he continually forced her to hire a lawyer for violating her rights of <a href=\"/wiki/Free_speech\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Free speech\">free speech</a>, which was costing her family considerable amounts of money. Sheryl graduated along with the rest of her class in the Season 1 finale, and presented Scott with a special award.</li>\n<li><b>Christine Banks</b> (<a href=\"/wiki/Lindsay_Hollister\" title=\"Lindsay Hollister\">Lindsay Hollister</a>) was an unpopular and overweight girl who was often bullied and got into trouble when she responded to the harassment with violence. Kevin Riley persuaded her to earn respect from the students by being on the wrestling team, and it worked. However, Christine suffered a <a href=\"/wiki/Heart_attack\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Heart attack\">heart attack</a> after playing a match, and later died.</li>\n<li><b>Brooke Harper</b> (<a href=\"/wiki/China_Shavers\" title=\"China Shavers\">China Shavers</a>) was Steven's headstrong daughter who was transferred to her father's high school after being kicked out of a <a href=\"/wiki/Private_school\" title=\"Private school\">private school</a> for kidnapping the school's mascot as part of an <a href=\"/wiki/Animal_rights\" title=\"Animal rights\">animal rights</a> protest. She continued her political activism, including organizing the students to stage a walkout over toxic chemicals and overcrowded classrooms in the school that ended up sparking a riot as the school athletes feared that these problems will be fixed by cutting the sports budget. Brooke once dated a 27-year-old man as well as Jeremy Peters, but neither relationship lasted long. She always hoped for her parents to get back together, but had accepted that it was not going to happen. At the end of the third season, Brooke had graduated and had been accepted to <a href=\"/wiki/Harvard_University\" title=\"Harvard University\">Harvard University</a>.</li>\n<li><b>Meredith Peters</b> (<a href=\"/wiki/Kathy_Baker\" title=\"Kathy Baker\">Kathy Baker</a>) was Scott's girlfriend in Season 2 who was given a teaching position at Winslow High. She was always a little questionable; <a href=\"/wiki/David_E._Kelley\" title=\"David E. Kelley\">David E. Kelley</a> apparently wanted the fans to always wonder if she was lying or not. Meredith was originally a recurring character in the later part of Season 1, and was suspected by Marilyn of abusing her son, Jeremy. It was later discovered that Meredith would often lock Jeremy in the basement as punishment. She mysteriously disappeared for a few episodes, during which time Jeremy's behavior was noticeably different. It was eventually revealed that Jeremy had locked <i>her</i> in the basement as retaliation against her punishments. Meredith returned in the first episode of Season 2 but without her right hand, which she'd accidentally severed in an attempt to escape from her bonds in the basement. After helping around Winslow High, she was given a teaching position and began her relationship with Scott shortly thereafter. A hook eventually took her right hand's place, which earned her the nickname of \"The Hook Lady.\" The hook was later replaced by a prosthetic given to her by Scott as a gift. She was eventually fired by Scott for hitting Marcie Kendall, which subsequently ended their increasingly shaky relationship. She makes her final appearance at Ronnie's disastrous surprise birthday party for Harry in \"Chapter Forty-One.\"</li>\n<li><b>Jeremy Peters</b> (<a href=\"/wiki/Kaj-Erik_Eriksen\" title=\"Kaj-Erik Eriksen\">Kaj-Erik Eriksen</a>) was Meredith's son. In Season 1, he was the student with the highest grades in his class and a student of Marilyn's. Marilyn consistently tried to help him when she suspected that his mother abused him; Jeremy eventually admitted to her that his mother would lock him in the basement as punishment. Near the end of Season 1, Jeremy's behavior significantly changed. He shifted from reserved and timid to sociable and rebellious. When Marilyn couldn't get in touch with Meredith, she suspected that Jeremy had done something to her. In the second-season premiere, Jeremy brought a severed hand into school to dissect. When Marilyn found out that the hand had belonged to a middle-aged woman, she began to theorize that the hand belonged to Meredith. She soon learned that Meredith was alive and well, but was indeed missing her right hand. It was later revealed that during her mysterious disappearance and Jeremy's dramatic change in behavior, Jeremy had actually locked her in the basement out of retaliation. After she lost the missing hand in an attempt to escape, they patched up their relationship with the help of family therapy. When Scott and Meredith began their relationship, Jeremy was jealous of the love his mother gave to Scott but never gave to him as a child. Scott likened their mother-son relationship to that of <a href=\"/wiki/Norman_Bates\" title=\"Norman Bates\">Norman Bates</a> and his mother. At some point, Scott discovered Jeremy kissing another boy backstage during a theater rehearsal, and it was assumed that he was <a href=\"/wiki/Homosexuality\" title=\"Homosexuality\">gay</a>. It was revealed that Jeremy was actually <a href=\"/wiki/Bisexual\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Bisexual\">bisexual</a> when Scott later discovered him kissing Brooke Harper. Jeremy's relationship with Brooke was sabotaged by Meredith due to her unusually accepting attitude towards the couple. Jeremy's last appearance is in the school hallway, when he's blown off by Scott after Meredith's departure from the show. It's presumed that he graduated with the rest of his class since he did not return in Season 3.</li>\n<li><b>Marcie Kendall</b> (<a href=\"/wiki/Cara_DeLizia\" title=\"Cara DeLizia\">Cara DeLizia</a>) was a student whom Meredith slapped with her prosthesis during an argument, leading to Meredith being fired. In the third season, Marcie became Scott's assistant and was involved in the student walkout.

She complained to Colin Flynn about his grade on Becky's assignment and, unhappy with her marriage, flirted with him, leading to an affair with the young teacher. Ultimately, Patricia reconciled with her husband and ended the affair.</li>\n<li><b>Rebecca 'Becky' Emerson</b> (<a href=\"/wiki/Courtney_Peldon\" title=\"Courtney Peldon\">Courtney Peldon</a>) was the beautiful but nutty daughter of Patricia Emerson who developed a crush on Colin and was devastated when she learned that he was sleeping with her mother.

Later, she became the anchorwoman of the <a href=\"/wiki/Student_television_station\" title=\"Student television station\">Student television station</a> and was about to air footage of a married teacher having sex with another woman in a classroom, but was persuaded from doing so by Danny. In the series' fourth and final season, Becky became Scott's assistant and once gave him surprisingly insightful advice.</li>\n<li><b>Devon Rick</b> (<a href=\"/wiki/Matt_Lutz\" title=\"Matt Lutz\">Matt Lutz</a>) was a gay teenager on the swim team who watched as his boyfriend was beaten up by their <a href=\"/wiki/Homophobia\" title=\"Homophobia\">homophobic</a> teammates. The incident prompted Scott to start up a <a href=\"/wiki/Gay-Straight_Alliance\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Gay-Straight Alliance\">Gay-Straight Alliance</a> and lecture the school on the evils of homophobia. Eventually, Scott persuaded Devon to come out and identify the students who beat up his boyfriend.</li>\n<li><b>Dave Fields</b> (<a href=\"/wiki/David_Conrad\" title=\"David Conrad\">David Conrad</a>) was liaison to the Mayor pushing for <a href=\"/wiki/Standardized_testing\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Standardized testing\">standardized testing</a> and budget cuts.
