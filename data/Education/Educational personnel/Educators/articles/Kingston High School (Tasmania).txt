  Kingston High School was a co-educational high school in Kingston, Tasmania.  The school taught students in grades 7-10 and currently has approximately 700 students enrolled. The school is a six-stream school, with at least six class groups for each year level at the school. The current Principal is Elizabeth Robinson.  Kingston High School was opened on Saturday December the 2nd 1972 by the then Minister for Education, Mr. Bill Neilson.  The school had an initial enrollment of 168 students, with students coming from the rural townships surrounding Kingston. In 2000 student numbers peaked at 797 students, with enrollments steadily declining over the next six years. From 2007, numbers have been steadily growing again with the student population expected to continue to increase. The school needed to relocate from the old Kingston CBD campus to the new Kingston View Drive campus at the beginning of the 2011 school year. The new school campus was opened on November the 4th 2011. Initial construction of the Kingston High School current campus was announced in 2007. The new campus is located in Kingston View Drive, on top of the old cemetery grounds bordering the Kingborough Sports Centre in western Kingston.   Construction on the project commenced in May 2009.
