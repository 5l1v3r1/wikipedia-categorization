Often the provost may serve as acting chief executive officer during a vacancy in that office or when the incumbent is absent from campus for prolonged periods. In these institutions, the title of provost is sometimes combined with those of <i>senior vice president</i>, <i>executive vice president</i>, <i>executive <a href=\"/wiki/Vice_chancellor\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Vice chancellor\">vice chancellor</a></i>, or the like, to denote that officer's high standing.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources.

At smaller independent liberal arts colleges, the chief academic officer may carry the title \"dean of the college\" or \"dean of the faculty\" in addition to or instead of <i>provost</i>. For example, at <a href=\"/wiki/Trinity_College,_Hartford\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Trinity College, Hartford\">Trinity College</a> in Hartford, Connecticut, the Dean of the Faculty is also the Vice President for Academic Affairs and is the second-highest administrator, directly beneath the President.\n</p><p>Provosts often receive staff support or delegate line responsibility for certain administrative functions to one or more subordinates variously called <i>assistant provost</i>, <i>associate provost</i>, <i>vice provost</i>, or <i>deputy provost</i>. The deputy provost is often the right hand person of the provost who assumes the provost's responsibilities in the provost's absence.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Other_titles_and_uses\">Other titles and uses</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Provost_(education)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Other titles and uses\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/State_university_system\" title=\"State university system\">State university systems</a> in the <a href=\"/wiki/United_States\" title=\"United States\">United States</a> are the <a href=\"/wiki/State_university\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"State university\">state universities</a> operated and funded primarily by the <a href=\"/wiki/State_governments_of_the_United_States\" title=\"State governments of the United States\">state government</a>.

In the context of local government, the title is even older; see <a href=\"/wiki/Provost_(civil)\" title=\"Provost (civil)\">Provost (civil)</a>\n</p><p>The first use of the title in American and Canadian higher education is unclear. At the <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania\" title=\"University of Pennsylvania\">University of Pennsylvania</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Columbia_University\" title=\"Columbia University\">Columbia University</a>, the title dates from the late 18th and early 19th centuries, respectively. At the University of Pennsylvania, the administrative head of the university was titled provost until the 1930s, when the Board of Trustees created a separate office of president and re-designated the provost as chief academic officer and subordinate to the new presidency. At Columbia University, the Board of Trustees established the office of provost in 1811, only to abolish it five years later. The Trustees and the president of the university re-established the office of provost in 1912. Although the precise title of the office has changed over time, the responsibility as Columbia's chief academic officer has remained constant.\n</p><p>Other North American universities and colleges created provostships during and after <a href=\"/wiki/World_War_II\" title=\"World War II\">World War II</a> when dramatic increases in undergraduate enrollments (due to the <a href=\"/wiki/G.I._Bill\" title=\"G.I. Bill\">G.I. Bill</a>) and the increased complexity of higher education administration, led many chief executive officers to adopt a more corporate governing structure. By the 1960s, most of the other <a href=\"/wiki/Ivy_League\" title=\"Ivy League\">Ivy League</a> institutions (<a href=\"/wiki/Dartmouth_College\" title=\"Dartmouth College\">Dartmouth</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Yale_University\" title=\"Yale University\">Yale</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Princeton_University\" title=\"Princeton University\">Princeton</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Cornell_University\" title=\"Cornell University\">Cornell</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Brown_University\" title=\"Brown University\">Brown</a>) had provosts (or equivalents), as did other private research universities such as the <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_Chicago\" title=\"University of Chicago\">University of Chicago</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Stanford_University\" title=\"Stanford University\">Stanford University</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Rice_University\" title=\"Rice University\">Rice University</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology\" title=\"Massachusetts Institute of Technology\">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Tufts_University\" title=\"Tufts University\">Tufts University</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Emory_University\" title=\"Emory University\">Emory University</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Wake_Forest_University\" title=\"Wake Forest University\">Wake Forest University</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Duke_University\" title=\"Duke University\">Duke University</a>.\n</p><p>At <a href=\"/wiki/Harvard_University\" title=\"Harvard University\">Harvard University</a>, the office of provost has had two distinct incarnations. The office's first incarnation was during World War II and the immediate postwar era. <a href=\"/wiki/James_Bryant_Conant\" title=\"James Bryant Conant\">James Bryant Conant</a>, the president of the university from 1933 to 1953, asked the Harvard Corporation (the more senior of the two governing boards) to create the office of provost in October 1945, at time when he (Conant) spent a great deal of time in Washington, D.C. as chairman of the <a href=\"/wiki/National_Defense_Research_Committee\" title=\"National Defense Research Committee\">National Defense Research Committee</a>. Conant appointed historian <a href=\"/wiki/Paul_Herman_Buck\" title=\"Paul Herman Buck\">Paul Herman Buck</a>, the dean of the Faculty of Arts of Sciences (FAS), to concurrently serve as provost. (The original legislation required that the provost be concurrently dean of FAS.) As provost and dean, Buck had oversight of FAS (which includes Harvard College, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the Extension School, the Summer School, and what is now called the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences) and its affiliated laboratories, research centres, and museums. However, he had no authority over Harvard's professional schools (at that time, the Divinity School, the Law School, the Faculty of Medicine, the School of Public Health, and the Graduate Schools of Business Administration, Design, Education, and Public Administration). The provost's office was eliminated when Conant retired from Harvard's presidency in 1953. During the presidencies of <a href=\"/wiki/Nathan_Marsh_Pusey\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Nathan Marsh Pusey\">Nathan Marsh Pusey</a> (1953\u20131971) and Derek C. Bok (1971\u20131993), the deans of Harvard's nine faculties reported directly to the president, with the dean of FAS being <i><a href=\"/wiki/Primus_inter_pares\" title=\"Primus inter pares\">primus inter pares</a></i>. The second incarnation began in 1993, when then-Harvard President Neil Rudenstine asked the Corporation to recreate the provostship as a second university-wide academic officer other than the president. A section of Harvard's 1997 Re-accreditation Report for the <a href=\"/wiki/New_England_Commission_of_Colleges_and_Schools\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"New England Commission of Colleges and Schools\">New England Commission of Colleges and Schools</a> reads:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>The Provost at Harvard acts as an extension of the President. He is the second academic officer, after the President, having purview of the entire University. The Provost has special responsibility for fostering intellectual interactions across the University, including the five Interfaculty Initiatives (environment, ethics and the professions, schooling and children, mind/brain/behavior, and health policy). The Provost also acts to help improve the quality and efficiency of central services organized at Harvard under the aegis of the Vice Presidents.</p></blockquote>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Provost_(education)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Director_(education)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Director (education)\">Director (education)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Postgraduate_education\" title=\"Postgraduate education\">Postgraduate education</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Principal_(university)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Principal (university)\">Principal (university)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Professor\" title=\"Professor\">Professor</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Undergraduate_education\" title=\"Undergraduate education\">Undergraduate education</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Provost_(education)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li>Freeland, Richard M.
