They prepare psychoeducational evaluation reports based on test results and interpretation. Integrated with case history, the evaluation reports should present an accurate and clear profile of a student\u2019s level of functioning or disability, strengths and weaknesses, compare test results with the standards of the evaluation instruments, analyze potential test biases, and develop appropriate recommendations to help direct educational interventions and services in a most inclusive and least restrictive environment. Evaluation reports are framed by laws and regulations applicable to testing and assessment in special education, and must follow school district policies and the codes of ethics applicable to education, special education, and psychological assessment.\n</p><p>School Psychological Examiners also provide psychoeducational interventions such as consultation services, collaboration in behavior management planning and monitoring, and devising social skills training programs in public schools.\n</p><p>Unless additionally trained and licensed, School Psychological Examiners do not offer or provide psychotherapy or clinical diagnostic/treatment services, which are attributions of licensed psychiatrists and clinical psychologists, as provided by law and professional regulations.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Qualifications\">Qualifications</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=School_Psychological_Examiner&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Qualifications\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>School Psychological Examiners are highly trained and experienced educators who hold a master\u2019s or higher degree in education or school counseling and at least one endorsement in special education. In addition to school district policies, School Psychological Examiners are bound by professional regulations, as well as by the ethical codes of testing and measurement. Other designations for School Psychological Examiners include \u2018Educational Examiners\u2019 or \u2018Psychoeducational Examiners.\u2019 Designation of this specialty varies among different school districts. \n</p><p>'Psychometrist,\u2019 from the term <a href=\"/wiki/Psychometrics\" title=\"Psychometrics\">psychometrics</a>, is an occupational designation not inclusive of the broader faculties of School Psychological Examiners. Psychometrists deal exclusively with quantitative test administration, do not require coursework beyond the bachelor's level, or licensure by a state department of education. Training of psychometrists is primarily done on-the-job, and their services are valuable in mental health community agencies, assessment and institutional research, or test-producing companies, etc., rather than in K-12 schools.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Graduate_Training_and_Licensure_of_School_Psychological_Examiners\">Graduate Training and Licensure of School Psychological Examiners</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=School_Psychological_Examiner&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Graduate Training and Licensure of School Psychological Examiners\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Typical training includes coursework beyond the Master of Education, Master of Science in Education, or Master of Arts in Teaching degrees. Currently, School Psychological Examiners complete the courses required by their state department of education rather than by a prescribed self-contained program of studies.  The coursework is equivalent to an entire Specialist or Doctoral Degree; unfortunately just a handful of institutions of higher education offer this kind of self-standing graduate program. Graduate courses of a psychological nature include:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Special Education Law</li>\n<li>Advanced Child and Adolescent Growth and Development</li>\n<li>Psychology of Students with Exceptionalities</li>\n<li>Abnormal Child and Adult Psychology</li>\n<li>Advanced Statistics and Research in Education and Psychology</li>\n<li>Tests and measurements</li>\n<li>Assessment and Evaluation of the Individual</li>\n<li>Individual Intelligence quotient</li>\n<li>Group  Assessment</li>\n<li>Diagnostics and Remedial Reading</li>\n<li>Ethical issues in education and psychological measurement and evaluation reporting</li>\n<li>Methods of Instructing Students with Mild/Moderate Disabilities</li>\n<li>Methods of Instructing Students with Severe to Profound Disabilities</li>\n<li>Survey of Guidance and Counseling Techniques</li>\n<li>Practicum for School Psychological Examiners (150 supervised contact hours).</li></ul>\n<p>Licensure as School Psychological Examiner demands experience in a special education or school counseling setting, satisfactory completion of the required graduate coursework and practicum, plus a passing score on the 'Praxis II Special Education: Knowledge-Based Core Principles'.  Graduate school recommendation and verification of experience by the employing school district complete the requirements. In addition to the practicum, on-the-job mentoring supervision for at least two school years, sometimes four years, allows the transition from initial licensure to standard professional licensure. An annual professional development plan and ongoing performance-based evaluation ensure 'High Quality' professionalism as required by the <a href=\"/wiki/No_Child_Left_Behind\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"No Child Left Behind\">No Child Left Behind</a> law and related regulations.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Competencies\">Competencies</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=School_Psychological_Examiner&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Competencies\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<style data-mw-deduplicate=\"TemplateStyles:r856303468\">.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}</style><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p>The clinical and technical skills needed to be a competent behavioral and clinical assessor include the abilities to do the following:\n</p><ol><li>Establish and maintain rapport with children, parents, and teachers</li>\n<li>Use effective assessment techniques appropriate for evaluating children\u2019s behavior</li>\n<li>Use effective techniques for obtaining accurate and complete information from parents and teachers</li>\n<li>Evaluate the psychometric properties of tests and other measures</li>\n<li>Select an appropriate assessment battery</li>\n<li>Administer and score tests and other assessment tools by following standardized procedures</li>\n<li>Observe and evaluate behavior objectively</li>\n<li>Perform informal assessments</li>\n<li>Interpret assessment results</li>\n<li>Use assessment findings to develop effective interventions</li>\n<li>Communicate assessment findings effectively, both orally and in writing</li>\n<li>Adhere to ethical standards</li>\n<li>Read and interpret research in behavioral and clinical assessment</li>\n<li>Keep up with laws and regulations concerning the assessment and placement of children with special needs.<div class=\"templatequotecite\">\u2014&#8201;<cite>Sattler, J.
