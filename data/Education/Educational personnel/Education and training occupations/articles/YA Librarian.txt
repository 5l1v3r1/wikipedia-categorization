YA Librarian, or teen librarian, is a librarian who works primarily with young adults, generally defined as between the ages of 12 and 18. A YA librarian's duties may include reviewing and ordering teen books, magazines, and media, planning library programs for teens, providing reference services to teens and other library patrons, visiting middle and high schools, conducting tours for school and community groups, teaching teens how to use the library's catalog and databases, doing outreach to teens in the community, and the organization of programs and events for the library's teen community. The YA librarian is the coordinator and organizer of all preteen and teen library volunteers. YA librarians work primarily in public libraries.
