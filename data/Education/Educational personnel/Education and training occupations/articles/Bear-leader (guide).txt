In the 18th and 19th centuries, a bear-leader was a colloquialism for a man who escorted young men of rank or wealth on their travels, such as young gentlemen on the Grand Tour.  The role of bear-leader blended elements of tutor, guardian, chaperon and companion.  A late example in literature can be seen in the ambitious Oxford tutor hired to keep an increasingly alcoholic young man out of harm's way – and out of the way – in Brideshead Revisited.
