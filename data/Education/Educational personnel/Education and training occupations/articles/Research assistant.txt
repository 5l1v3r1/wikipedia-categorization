A research assistant  is a researcher employed, often on a temporary contract,  by a university or a research institute, for the purpose of assisting in academic research. Research assistants are not independent and not directly responsible for the outcome of the research  and are responsible to a supervisor or principal investigator. Research assistants are often educated to degree level  and might be enrolled in a postgraduate degree  program and simultaneously teach.    Although a research assistant is normally appointed at graduate level, undergraduates are also sometimes appointed to support research.  Similarly, someone who has recently been awarded a doctoral degree may hold a temporary appointment as a postdoctoral research assistant. A clinical research assistant is employed by a hospital or medical research centre, who is involved in the administration of clinical trials.  He or she  may assist a senior investigator with recruiting and enrolling research subjects, as well as with correspondence and grant applications.
