Preservation administrators are librarians who are trained in the management of preservation in libraries and archives. The term is often used as a parallel term to conservator, an allied profession that is focused primarily on the corrective repair of artefacts. The term "preservationist" has fairly wide usage as a synonym for "preservation administrator" or a broader term for anyone active in the fields of conservation or preservation, but has never found professional favor.
