 TAFE Queensland SkillsTech (previously known as SkillsTech Australia and Trade and Technician Skills Institute) is a pre-eminent provider of vocational education and training in Queensland. With four trade training centres across Brisbane, TAFE Queensland SkillsTech offers specialist trade training across a wide variety of industry areas.  The process of consolidating TAFE Queensland SkillsTech and five other regional registered training organisations (RTOs) into a single RTO started in July 2017. TAFE Queensland SkillsTech now no longer operates as a separate RTO, and has been consolidated into the TAFE Queensland organisation.  TAFE Queensland SkillsTech and TAFE Queensland Brisbane co-operate the Alexandra Hills and Bracken Ridge locations.
