A Jugend- und Auszubildendenvertretung (German for "Youth and Trainees council") is a workers' representation of all workers below the age of 18 and in-plant training employees (trainees, apprentices, working students) below the age of 25 in Germany as described in the Betriebsverfassungsgesetz (co-determination law). It's the analog to the Betriebsrat (works council) and thus only exists if a Betriebsrat exists.
