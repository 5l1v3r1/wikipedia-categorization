Dual sector education is a system of tertiary education that includes substantial amounts of both vocational (skills-based) and higher (academic-based) education in the same institution.   Dual sector education is offered by colleges and universities worldwide, most prominently in Australia,  Austria, Germany,  Ireland, New Zealand,  Switzerland and the United Kingdom.  It differs from, and/or can also encompass, the similarly termed dual education system - which combines both vocational education within a school and an apprenticeship within a workplace.   Moodie distinguishes between single sector institutions which offer 97% of their teaching in one sector, mixed sector institutions which teach from 3% to 20% of their students in their smaller sector, and dual sector institutions which have substantial (> 20% of their load) in each of vocational and higher education.
