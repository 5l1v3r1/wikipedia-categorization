The Employment and Training Administration (ETA) is part of the U.S. Department of Labor. Its mission is to provide training, employment, labor market information, and income maintenance services. ETA administers federal government job training and worker dislocation programs, federal grants to states for public employment service programs, and unemployment insurance benefits. These services are primarily provided through state and local workforce development systems. The agency was at first called the Manpower Administration when it was founded in 1954.  It was given its present name in 1975.  The most recent confirmed Assistant Secretary was Portia Wu, until January 2017.   The top position has remained vacant since then, and the acting head of the agency is a civil servant, Byron Zuidema.
