They have a very clearly legislated objective in regional development. As there is mandatory five-month practical training for all students, AMKs may be a good platform for dispersing applied knowledge throughout higher education.

Their role was to give training for roles that need both practical skills and management work, such as a foreman in construction. In engineering, the degree was referred to as <i>opistoinsin\u00f6\u00f6ri</i> or <i>teknikko</i>. In construction, there was <i>rakennusinsin\u00f6\u00f6ri</i>, <i>rakennusarkkitehti</i> and <i>rakennusmestari</i>.\n</p><p>Until recently<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#Chronological_items\" title=\"Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers\"><span title=\"The time period mentioned near this tag is ambiguous. (September 2015)\">when?</span></a></i>&#93;</sup>, AMKs were granting only tertiary degrees (3\u20134 years) that are specialized to particular vocations (e.g. <i>insin\u00f6\u00f6ri</i>, translated into English as <a href=\"/wiki/Bachelor_of_Engineering\" title=\"Bachelor of Engineering\">Bachelor of Engineering</a>); they are different from, but in their level comparable to, academic <a href=\"/wiki/Bachelor%27s_degree\" title=\"Bachelor&#39;s degree\">bachelor's degrees</a> which are awarded by universities. In 2005, \"higher AMK\" degrees (which are translated into English as <a href=\"/wiki/Master%27s_degree\" title=\"Master&#39;s degree\">master's degrees</a>) have been introduced for holders of an AMK degree or a similar degree, like a bachelor's degree from a university, to continue studies while also working. AMK's do not grant the higher degrees of <a href=\"/wiki/Licentiate_(degree)\" title=\"Licentiate (degree)\">licentiate</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Ph.D.\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Ph.D.\">Ph.D.</a> granted by universities, and a holder of an AMK higher degree is not eligible for doctoral studies in universities without specific studies bridging the gap between the two orientations (academic and vocational).\n</p><p>Finnish higher education has a dual model, where <a href=\"/wiki/University\" title=\"University\">universities</a> (yliopisto) focus on scientific or artistic master's and higher degrees, and AMKs on vocationally oriented education on bachelor and master levels. The phrase \"equal but different\" was used in conjunction with the dual model, meaning that Finnish AMKs and universities serve different goals in the field of higher education and should not be combined on any level. The ongoing <a href=\"/wiki/Bologna_process\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Bologna process\">Bologna process</a>, however, has led to some reform, where by complementing AMK studies with some theoretical studies, the route to higher degrees is open. Changes are described in detail in <a href=\"/wiki/Education_in_Finland\" title=\"Education in Finland\">Education in Finland</a>.\n</p><p>There are about 100,000 students in AMKs. The most common field of education is <a href=\"/wiki/Engineering\" title=\"Engineering\">engineering</a>, in which the schools offer high-level majors starting from a broad base of mathematics and physics related to the field of study. Engineers graduate after a minimum of four years and 240 <a href=\"/wiki/European_Credit_Transfer_and_Accumulation_System\" title=\"European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System\">ECTS</a> credits are awarded. The degree of <a href=\"/wiki/Insin%C3%B6%C3%B6ri_(amk)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Insin\u00f6\u00f6ri (amk)\">insin\u00f6\u00f6ri (amk)</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Ingenj%C3%B6r_(YH)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Ingenj\u00f6r (YH)\">ingenj\u00f6r (YH)</a> (for Swedish-speaking population) is often compared to the non-Finnish 'Bachelor of Engineering'.\n</p><p>Other typical fields of study in an <i>ammattikorkeakoulu</i> are health care (<a href=\"/wiki/Nursing\" title=\"Nursing\">nursing</a>), business, and culture.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"More_accurate_naming\">More accurate naming</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=University_of_applied_sciences_(Finland)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: More accurate naming\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The term \"university of applied sciences\" was universally applied on January 1, 2006 to all Finnish <i>ammattikorkeakoulu</i>s to give a more correct impression of the level of education given. The term is borrowed from the German \"<a href=\"/wiki/Fachhochschule\" title=\"Fachhochschule\">Fachhochschule</a>\". The decision could be made by the <i>ammattikorkeakoulu</i>s, because there is no legislation concerning the translations of Finnish terms.\n</p><p>Because degrees from an AMK are more oriented towards practical applications, compared to the degrees offered by Universities in Finland, a holder of an AMK degree, wishing to get a master's degree from a Finnish university, may have to complete 60 ETCS worth of theoretical and scientific studies in addition to the normal master's degree requirement.\n</p><p>Since 2005, the Finnish Parliament has approved the creation of a higher AMK degree, similar to the master's degree in universities. This has led to a small-scale boost in new degree programmes (in limited fields of education), to the extent of 60-90 ECTS credits. They will give similar qualifications as a university master's degree in the same areas of education. But a minimum amount of 3 years of work experience gained after latest tertiary degree is needed to qualify for AMK higher degree programme.\n</p><p>At the end of 2010, there were nationwide discussions about the excessive number of students in AMKs, especially in the fields of Engineering and Business. This is connected to a problem in funding \u2014 AMKs receive their funding largely based on the students enrollment numbers (this is changing to a more management-by-results approach).<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template\" style=\"margin-left:0.1em; white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify\" title=\"Wikipedia:Please clarify\"><span title=\"The text near this tag may need clarification or removal of jargon.
