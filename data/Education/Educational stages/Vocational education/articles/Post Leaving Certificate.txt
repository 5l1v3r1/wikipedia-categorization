  Post Leaving Certificate (PLC) (Irish: Cúrsa Iar Ard-Teistiméarachta) is an informal term for a large range of courses and qualifications run in Ireland for students who have finished their secondary education. The majority of students who enrol on a PLC course are under 23, but mature students are welcome as well. A Post Leaving Certificate course is taken after a student has passed their Leaving Certificate, and is generally a one- or two-year course. PLC courses are aimed primarily at students who would like to develop vocational or technological skills in order to enter an occupation, or go on to higher education. The majority of Post Leaving Certificate courses are certified by the Further Education and Training Awards Council (FETAC), who also monitors the quality of the courses, and determines standards. FETAC does not however deliver the award programmes itself, these are generally left to the teaching institution themselves.  PLC courses are usually full-time, and run for one or two years. They generally focus on practical work, academic basics, and work experience in a relevant industry. The majority of courses take place in Colleges/Institutes of Further Education, however they are increasingly being taught in private colleges, particularly in the Dublin area. Courses offered include: Qualifications vary from one institution to another, but a common certification is a FETAC level 5 Certificate or level 6 Advanced Certificate & to a lesser extent a BTEC Higher National Diploma/Higher National Certificate. Courses may also give awards certified by other qualification authorities such as the Royal Society of Arts (RSA) City & Guilds, Institute of Commercial Management BTEC/Edexcel, the Irish Exporters Association & ITEC.
