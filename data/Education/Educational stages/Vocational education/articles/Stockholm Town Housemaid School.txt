The Stockholm Town Housemaid School (Swedish: Stockholms stads hembiträdesskola) was a vocational school started in 1938 at Scheelegatan 8 on the island of Kungsholmen in Stockholm, Sweden. The school educated housemaids. It was established during a shortage of housemaids, and the idea was well received. The students were graded, and the classes where phtographed wearing housemaid uniforms.  Harald Norbelie has depicted the school in a chapter of the 1993 book Mera gata upp och gata ner: människor och miljöer i Stockholm förr och nu.
