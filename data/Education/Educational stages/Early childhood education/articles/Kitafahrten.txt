Kitafahrten is an annual multi-day camping trip (fahrten means "trip" or "wanderings")  for German kindergarten children designed to increase responsibility for self and others by placing them in nature and away from their parents.  A teacher supervises the children during the cramping trip,   and contact with parents is only allowed in emergencies. The concept and the word itself were created by Friedrich Fr√∂bel in the 19th century.  He also created  the concept of kindergarten.      It is popular in Berlin but not throughout all of Germany.
