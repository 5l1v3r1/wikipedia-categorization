The Four Square Writing Method is a way for teaching writing to children in school. While primarily used to teach persuasive writing, it has also been used to help teach deconstruction.  The method was developed by Judith S. Gould   and Evan Jay Gould.   It was developed initially for primary school students, but it has also been used in high school classes. The method is primarily a visual framework for assisting students with formulating ideas in an organized manner prior to writing an essay. The concept generally works as follows: Variations of the above rules may require more or less development in each of the rectangles, depending on the grade-level or maturity of the student. Results show a consistent increase in the ability of students to write persuasively. A study at Springview Elementary School, in Allendale Charter Township, Michigan, noted, "significant growth was observed in the students' writings in both classes."   Another study, carried out at American Senior High School in Miami-Dade County, Florida with older students, showed an increase in FCAT scores, though not as marked as the Michigan grade school students. It was noted that one teacher had remarkably more success with the program than others, and that teachers must be trained thoroughly to get best results from this method.   Kingsley Elementary School in Kingsport, Tennessee also tested the Four Square Writing Method. After teaching students using the method, the students' writing scores increased by 49 percentage points in the first year. The same students used it again the next year, and their scores went up an additional nine percentage points.   In 1999, Judith S. Gould and Evan Jay Gould wrote the first book in a series dedicated to the Four Square Writing Method.  This series is published by the Teaching & Learning Company, a Lorenz Educational Press company. As of February 2014, the series includes 16 books, 2 poster papers, and a set of wall charts.
