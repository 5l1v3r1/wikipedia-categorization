The Grundtvig programme is a European funding programme that is part of the European Commission’s Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013  and aims to strengthen the European dimension in adult education and lifelong learning across Europe. The programme specifically seeks to address the educational challenge of an ageing population and to provide adults with alternative pathways to updating their skills and competences. The Grundtvig programme encompasses all types of learning, whether these take place in the 'formal' or 'non-formal' system of education for adults, or in more 'informal' ways, such as autonomous learning, community learning or experiential learning.  It is open to anyone in adult education. This includes adult learners, teachers and trainers from a variety of organisations including local authorities, non-governmental organisations, charities, universities, community groups, etc. 'Adult' in the Grundtvig programme refers to all persons over the age of 25 and all persons aged 16–24 who are no longer undergoing initial education within the formal education system.  The Grundtvig programme provides funding for a wide range of activities. Some examples are basic skills, foreign languages, parental education, arts and culture projects. All projects involve working with European partners and offer a learning and personal development experience for staff and learners.
