A German Academie is a school or college, trade school or another educational institution. The word Akademie (unlike the words Gymnasium or Universit√§t) is not protected by law and any school or college may choose to call itself Akademie. A Sommerakademie (Summer Akademie) is a programme that teaches different groups of children or grown-ups usually during the summer month. Sometimes those programmes are remedial in nature. The word Akademie derives from the Platonic Academy, which was located near the bosk of Akademos.
