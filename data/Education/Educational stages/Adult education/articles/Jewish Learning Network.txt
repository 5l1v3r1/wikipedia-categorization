The Jewish Learning Network or JNET is an adult education program run by the Chabad-Lubavitch movement. It is a division of the Chabad movement's educational arm, Merkos L'Inyonei Chinuch.      "JNet" is a non-profit organization acting under Merkos L'Inyonei Chinuch, the central educational organization of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement.  JNet was founded in November, 2005 as an adult education resource. The program matches registrants with volunteers based on the registrant's study request. Registrants often have little Jewish education, while volunteers are often Chabad-raised and schooled.    The organization's current director is Rabbi Yehuda Dukes.
