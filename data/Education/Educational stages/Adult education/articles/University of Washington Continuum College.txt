University of Washington Continuum College, formerly Educational Outreach is the continuing education and professional development unit of the University of Washington (UW), in Seattle, Washington. Founded in 1912, UW Continuum College was originally the branch of the university offering correspondence courses. Today, this UW unit provides wide-ranging programs for non-traditional and lifelong learning students, including degree programs, certificate programs and select courses through UW Professional & Continuing Education, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), UW in the High School, UW Summer Quarter, UW Summer Youth, UW International & English Language Programs, Osher Institute for Lifelong Learning at the UW, and Conference Services. The programs provided are fee-based and self-sustaining and do not receive state funds for support. In 2017, UW Continuum College released a new line of professional certificate programs called Career Accelerator, making their most popular programs available in four different formats: in-person, online, accelerated, and self-paced. Also in 2017, UW Continuum College created its first-ever scholarship program. The UW Certificate Scholarship covers 80 to 100 percent of the course fees for qualified applicants of select certificate programs offered through UW Professional & Continuing Education.
