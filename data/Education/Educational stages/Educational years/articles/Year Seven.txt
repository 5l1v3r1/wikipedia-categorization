 Year 7 is an educational year group in schools in many countries including England, Wales, Australia and New Zealand. It is the seventh year (or eighth in Australia) of compulsory education and is roughly equivalent to grade 6 in America and Canada (or to grade 7 for the Australian Year 7). In Australia, Year 7 is usually the eighth year of compulsory education. Although there are slight variations between the states, most children in Year 7 are aged from twelve to thirteen. Children in Year 7 start High School, Secondary School or Secondary Colleges, or finish Primary School.  In New Zealand, Year 7 is the seventh year of compulsory education. Children entering Year 7 are generally aged between 10.5 and 12.   Year 7 pupils are educated in full primary schools, intermediate schools, and in some areas area schools or combined intermediate and secondary schools.  In schools in England and Wales, Year 7 is the seventh full year of compulsory education after Reception, with children being admitted who are aged 11 before 1 September in any given academic year. It is the first year group in Key Stage 3 in which the Secondary National Curriculum is taught  and marks the beginning of secondary education.   Year 7 follows Year 6, the last year of primary school education. Year 7 is usually the first year of Secondary school. In some areas of England, Year 7 is the final or penultimate year group in Middle school. In Northern Ireland and Scotland, the seventh year of compulsory education is called Primary Seven, and pupils generally start at the age of 10â€“11.
