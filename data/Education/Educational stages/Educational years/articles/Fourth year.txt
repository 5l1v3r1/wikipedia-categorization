Fourth year, also known as S4, is the fourth year of schooling in Scottish, Venezuelan, Ecuadorian, Colombian, and other Latin American countries  secondary schools, and is roughly equivalent to Year 10 in England and Wales and Year 12 (Sixth Form) in Northern Ireland. In Latin American countries, it is equal to the United States high school's senior year, but the Scottish S4 is equivalent to 10th grade. Most pupils are 15 or 16 years old at the end of S4. It is at the end of this year the pupils completed their Standard Grade, or Intermediates examinations, as of 2013 it is the National 4/5 examinations for the new Curriculum for Excellence . It is also usually the last year of compulsory education in Scotland, depending on what time of the year the pupil was born. Near the end of fourth year pupils pick the subjects they want to take for highers (or A levels as they call it in England). They can also leave school if they are 16. The term can also refer to the fourth year of a university course.
