 Year Thirteen is an educational year group in schools in many countries including England, Wales, Northern Ireland, Australia and New Zealand. It is sometimes the thirteenth and final year of compulsory education, or alternatively a year of post-compulsory education.  In certain Australian states, some schools will offer a ‘Year 13’ programme to students who wish to complete the usual one-year Year 12 programme over two years, or who were not successful in a sufficient number of subjects to attain the relevant Year 12 qualification on their first attempt. Year 13 students generally undertake standard Year 12 subjects alongside Year 12 students, and the majority of students will not undertake Year 13.  In New Zealand, Year Thirteen is the second year of post-compulsory education. Students entering Year 13 are usually aged between 16.5 and 18.   A student may stay in Year Thirteen until the end of the calendar year following their 19th birthday. Year Thirteen pupils are educated in secondary schools or in area schools.  Year Thirteen was previously known as the 7th form and students will be studying towards NCEA Level 3. In schools in England Year 13 is the thirteenth year after Reception. It is normally the final year of Key Stage 5 and is part of compulsory education following provisions of the Education and Skills Act 2008 becoming effective in 2015. The majority of students admitted to this academic year are aged 17 before 1st September in that year. In Northern Ireland Year Thirteen is the first year of post-compulsory education. Students in Year Thirteen are aged between 16 and 17. It usually forms part of a Sixth form or Sixth-form college.
