Year Fourteen is an educational year group in Northern Ireland. It is the second and final year of post-compulsory Sixth form education. Commonly in England and Wales, students will re-apply to their sixth form after completing year 13 to study a fifteenth year of education if they are unable to obtain a university place or need to complete their A Levels. They are then sometimes referred to as being in Year 14.
