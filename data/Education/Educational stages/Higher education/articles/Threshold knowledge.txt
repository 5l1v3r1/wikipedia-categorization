Threshold knowledge is a term in the study of higher education used to describe core concepts — or threshold concepts — which, once understood, transform perception of a given subject, phenomenon, or experience.   Introduced by Jan Meyer and Ray Land,     Meyer and Land also discuss the related idea of troublesome knowledge, ideas that appear alien or counter-intuitive.    the theory holds that: "there are certain concepts, or certain learning experiences, which resemble passing through a portal, from which a new perspective opens up, allowing things formerly not perceived to come into view. This permits a new and previously inaccessible way of thinking about something. It represents a transformed way of understanding, or interpreting, or viewing something, without which the learner cannot progress, and results in a reformulation of the learners’ frame of meaning. The thresholds approach also emphasises the importance of disciplinary contexts. As a consequence of comprehending a threshold concept there may thus be a transformed internal view of subject matter, subject landscape, or even world view. Typical examples might be ‘Personhood’ in Philosophy; ‘The Testable Hypothesis’ in Biology; ‘Gravity’ in Physics; ‘Reactive Power’ in Electrical Engineering; ‘Depreciation’ in Accounting; ‘Legal Narrative’ in Law; ‘Geologic Time’ in Geology; ‘Uncertainty’ in Environmental Science; ‘Deconstruction’ in Literature; ‘Limit’ in Mathematics or ‘Object-oriented Programming’ in Computer Science." (Meyer, Land & Baillie, 2010, p. ix) These ideas have been explored by several subsequent researchers in a variety of disciplinary contexts including: The theory has also been criticised.
