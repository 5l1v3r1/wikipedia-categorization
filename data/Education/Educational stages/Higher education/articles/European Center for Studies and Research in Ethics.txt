The European Center for Studies and Research in Ethics  is a tertiary establishment for divers forms of research and studies in Ethics. This center is located at the premises of the old faculty of medicine at Strasbourg, France. The CEERE (Centre européen d’enseignement et de recherche en éthique) as it is called in French, collaborates with multiple university and higher education institutions both in France and from other countries in its pursuit of world class innovative research and academics in the domain of Ethics. The CEERE affords students the opportunity to undertake studies for the award of master’s and doctoral degrees in Ethics from the University of Strasbourg. The Masters program can be undertaken in any of five specialities such as Medical Ethics and Bioethics, Ethics and Religions, Ethics and Management, Human Rights: Principles, Norms and Interpretation, as well as in Ethics and Society. This Masters program also had a bilingual program in English and French. The 2014 summer school in Ethics organized by CEERE and her partners was considered a huge success, drawing students from many countries around the world. The CEERE team is composed of eminent professors and scholars from a wide range of disciplines underlining the pluridisciplinary nature of research that goes on in CEERE. In June 2008, the CEERE was awarded the first prize in France for the teaching of Ethics. This price is one of the many recognitions the center has since received for its service to the academic community in France and worldwide with regard to research in Ethics. There exists an alumni association for former students of CEERE who collaborate on divers research projects including helping new students discover the rich world of research and studies in Ethics. This association was formed in 2013. The CEERE has organized five international symposia in Ethics in Strasbourg, France, since its inception in 2008.
