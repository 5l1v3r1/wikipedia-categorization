 JumpStart Kindergarten (known as Jump Ahead Classic Kindergarten in the UK) is an educational personal computer game developed by Fanfare Software and released by Knowledge Adventure on the MS-DOS platform in 1994 (v1.0). It was the first product released in the JumpStart series and, as its name suggests, it is intended to teach kindergarten students. It was ported to the Windows and Macintosh systems in 1995 (v1.2). It was updated with a new version in 1998 (v2.0). In 2000, the game was specially designed on VHS. That same year it was updated with additional content in a 2-CD Deluxe version in 2000 (v2.6), that included JumpStart Around the World. Eventually it was replaced in 2002 by JumpStart Advanced Kindergarten. The game takes place in a kindergarten schoolhouse. The game is hosted by the teacher, an anthropomorphic gray bunny named Mr. Hopsalot. The specifics of the game vary from the two versions, but in both the user may access educational activities and simple games by clicking on objects. In the early version, all of the activities are accessible from a single screen inside the classroom. In the re-release, different areas of the classroom and the nearby areas outside containing activities may be explored and as a new addition playing activities earns the player stars.
