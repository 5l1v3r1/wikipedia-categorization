The vice principal leads in the local officials and special guests. The teachers all stand and <a href=\"/wiki/Bowing#Bowing_in_Japan_and_Korea\" title=\"Bowing\">bow</a> to them as they enter. When the graduates enter, they are led by their homeroom teachers. Everyone walks very slow and deliberate. They walk in straight lines and make 90 degree turns if turning is necessary. The students line up next to their chairs and wait for the home room teacher to signal and they all sit at once. The homeroom teacher then joins the rest of the teachers. The head of ceremonies asks everyone to stand and bow towards the Japanese flag. This is coordinated by playing three chords on the piano. 1st-prepare, 2nd-bow, 3rd-return upright.\n</p><p>Singing has a large part in the Japanese schools curriculum and is also a big part of graduation. The first song is <a href=\"/wiki/Japanese_national_anthem\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Japanese national anthem\">Japan's national anthem</a>, followed by the city song and the school song. The latter two are usually printed in the program. This is the last time the graduating class will sing the school song together with the rest of the school. At this point, or after diplomas, the lower class sings to the graduating class, and the graduating class to the lower class. Then everyone sings together. Some of the possible songs are: <i>Tabidachi no Hi ni</i> <a href=\"https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%97%85%E7%AB%8B%E3%81%A1%E3%81%AE%E6%97%A5%E3%81%AB\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"ja:\u65c5\u7acb\u3061\u306e\u65e5\u306b\">ja:\u65c5\u7acb\u3061\u306e\u65e5\u306b</a>, <i>Sayonara</i>, <i>Until the World is One</i> by <a href=\"/wiki/Ya-Ya-Yah\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Ya-Ya-Yah\">Ya-Ya-Yah</a>, <i>Sakura</i> by <a href=\"/wiki/Naotaro_Moriyama\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Naotaro Moriyama\">Naotaro Moriyama</a> <a href=\"https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%81%95%E3%81%8F%E3%82%89_(%E6%A3%AE%E5%B1%B1%E7%9B%B4%E5%A4%AA%E6%9C%97%E3%81%AE%E6%9B%B2)\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"ja:\u3055\u304f\u3089 (\u68ee\u5c71\u76f4\u592a\u6717\u306e\u66f2)\">ja:\u3055\u304f\u3089 (\u68ee\u5c71\u76f4\u592a\u6717\u306e\u66f2)</a>, <i><a href=\"/wiki/Aogeba_T%C5%8Dtoshi\" title=\"Aogeba T\u014dtoshi\">Aogeba T\u014dtoshi</a></i> and <i><a href=\"/wiki/Hotaru_no_Hikari\" title=\"Hotaru no Hikari\">Hotaru no Hikari</a></i> (sung to the tune of <a href=\"/wiki/Auld_Lang_Syne\" title=\"Auld Lang Syne\">Auld Lang Syne</a>).\n</p><p>After singing has finished the principal, wearing a Japanese style tuxedo or <a href=\"/wiki/Black_tie\" title=\"Black tie\">black tie</a> goes to the podium. Usually a female teacher wearing a <a href=\"/wiki/Hakama\" title=\"Hakama\">hakama</a> brings out diplomas on a large tray. The homeroom teacher for each class calls out the names of his or her students in gender-split alphabetical order. Recently some schools have discontinued splitting the class by gender. Students stand and say \"\u306f\u3044\" (hai), Japanese for \"yes\". Large classes may only have their names called. Smaller classes might have each student go to the stage and receive their diploma. They queue up, walking in straight lines, 90 degree turns, at a deliberately slow pace. At some elementary schools the students give a short speech about what they want to do at Junior High before receiving their diplomas.\n</p><p>The principal reads the diploma out loud once to the first student in each class. The diploma is handed over full size in an open cover (not rolled-up). The principal rotates the diploma to face the student and hands it to them. The student receives the diploma by using their left hand first, and then their right hand before pulling it towards them. The student steps back and exchanges bows with the principal. The student then slowly closes the diploma and folds it under their left hand before turning and walking away. Returning to their seats, students stop and bow to the special guests.\n</p><p>After all the students are seated again the principal makes a speech. The speeches are <a href=\"/wiki/Japanese_writing_system#Direction_of_writing\" title=\"Japanese writing system\">written</a> vertically from top to bottom, right to left on a fan folded piece of paper. The principal's speech is followed by the head of the PTA. At junior high school an underclassmen may give a speech thanking the graduating students for things like being good <a href=\"/wiki/Senpai_and_k%C5%8Dhai\" title=\"Senpai and k\u014dhai\">senpai</a>. And this is followed by a student speech from the student president. Students may give set group speeches, as if a dialogue between the lower class and upper class. Students take turns yelling out parts of the dialogue sometimes being accompanied by everyone or a few other students in unison. This might happen before, in-between and/or after the songs.\n</p><p>After ceremony students may get a final address by their homeroom teacher. A few moments later, the graduates are free to roam around the school, in and out of the teachers\u2019 office. At Junior High school, students take everything with them on the last day and may do school cheers with the underclassman in front of the school. The school calendar does not end with graduation. The next business day after the ceremony 1st and 2nd year students continue classes until spring break officially starts.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Philippines\">Philippines</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Academic_graduation_by_country&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Philippines\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><i><b>Graduation</b></i> is the award or acceptance of an academic degree or diploma . For Filipinos, the term \u201cgraduation\u201d usually refers to the graduation ceremonies undergone by graduates who have finished a level of education. Some view a person as having truly graduated only if they have \u201cmarched\u201d onstage to accept their diploma during the graduation ceremonies. Thus, graduation may be also considered a coming-of-age ritual for young Filipinos.\nGraduation ceremonies are held at the end of March or, in some cases, the beginning of April of every year.\n</p><p>Filipinos take part in a graduation ceremony every time they complete an educational level. These ceremonies are usually held for graduation from kindergarten, elementary school, high school, vocational school or college, and graduate school. \nAttire\nIn past decades, <a href=\"/wiki/Elementary_school\" title=\"Elementary school\">elementary school</a> and high school graduates usually wore white: white dresses for girls and white polo shirts and black pants for boys. The same went for kindergarten \u201cgraduates\u201d except that girls usually wore identical dresses in a style and color agreed upon by the parents. Recent trends call for togas and mortarboards as standard graduation attire. The Department of Education also recently called for austerity measures, prohibiting extravagant spending and requiring students to wear only their school uniforms under their togas.\n</p><p>Graduates of <a href=\"/wiki/Vocational_schools\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Vocational schools\">vocational schools</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Colleges\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Colleges\">colleges</a> usually wear togas and <a href=\"/wiki/Mortarboards\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Mortarboards\">mortarboards</a> or caps. These are usually black, except for those colleges and universities who have togas made in the school colors. Underneath, the graduates wear formal clothes which may range from \u201cSunday best\u201d to party attire.\n</p><p>Those who finish post-graduate studies usually wear slightly different togas from those who finish undergraduate degrees. They also wear hoods banded with the color associated with their particular post-graduate <a href=\"/wiki/Course_(education)\" title=\"Course (education)\">course</a>.\n</p><p>All <a href=\"/wiki/Graduates\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Graduates\">graduates</a> usually wear <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Corsages&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Corsages (page does not exist)\">corsages</a> pinned on the left lapel or left breast of their clothing.\n</p><p><i><b>Baccalaureate Mass</b></i>\nHigh school graduation ceremonies usually have a baccalaureate mass before the actual graduation ceremonies begin. This is especially true if the school is Catholic. Elementary school and college/post-graduate school graduations may or may not have baccalaureate masses.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Universities\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Universities\">Universities</a> and colleges usually celebrate the <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Baccalaureate_mass&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Baccalaureate mass (page does not exist)\">baccalaureate mass</a> and baccalaureate ceremonies on a separate day, usually the day before the graduation ceremonies. This is especially true if the school is Catholic. On this day, the awards for extra-curricular and co-curricular activities are given out, leaving only the major academic awards to be given on the graduation day itself.\n</p><p><i><b><a href=\"/wiki/Awards\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Awards\">Awards</a></b></i>\nThe giving of awards for extra-curricular, co-curricular and academic activities are not the same throughout the country. Schools may give out all the awards on graduation day itself, or may do so on a separate day before the graduation ceremonies.\n</p><p>Schools with a small student population usually opt to give out all awards on graduation day itself. However, bigger schools may give out lesser awards on the day before, which is called Recognition Day or Baccalaureate Day. These awards include those for extra-curricular and co-curricular activities like Athlete of the Year and Dancer of the Year, as well as \u201cgood conduct\u201d awards such as \"Most Behaved\" and \"Most Neat and Clean\". The number and name of the awards may vary from school to school, depending on whom the teachers wish to honor.\n</p><p>The major academic awards given out on graduation day for elementary and high school are the awards for valedictorian, salutatorian and honorable mention. Many schools give awards to their top five graduates as follows: valedictorian, salutatorian, and first, second and third honorable mentions. The other awards are usually the Leadership Award and the awards for those who topped the different subjects. The latter are usually referred to as the \u201cBests\u201d, since they start with the words \u201cBest in...\u201d such as, for example, \u201cBest in Math\u201d.\n</p><p>College and post-graduate schools usually award the following awards: summa cum laude (with highest honors), magna cum laude (with high honors), and cum laude (with honors). Unlike the awards given in elementary and high schools which depend on class ranking, undergraduate and post-graduate awards are given based on grade point averages, so that there may be more than one graduate with the same award, or in many cases, none at all.\n</p><p>Awards are usually given in the form of ribbons on which are printed the name of the award, or medals with the name of the award engraved on the back, as well as certificates.\n</p><p><i><b>Ceremony</b></i>\nAlthough ceremonies vary from school to school, certain basic elements are usually the same. A typical graduation ceremony starts with the processional, which in some cases consists of the graduating class and their parents who formally walk side by side into the venue for the ceremony. Some schools have the students leave their parents at their designated seats. Boys then go up on the stage from the left and girls from the right. The two lines meet in center stage and go down the front steps, each pair bowing to the audience just before they reach the top step.\n</p><p>After the processional comes the invocation, which may either be spoken or sung by a choir or by the graduates themselves. Then, the <a href=\"/wiki/Lupang_Hinirang\" title=\"Lupang Hinirang\">national anthem</a> is sung and the salutatorian gives their salutatory address which serves as the welcome address or opening remarks. The keynote speaker is then introduced. This speaker may be a notable person, a person of some authority or influence, or even a former student who has made good in their chosen field and whom the school feels should be an inspiration to the graduates. After the keynote address, the school principal, or chancellor in the case of universities, presents the graduates to the representative of the appropriate government institution by having them stand up. The representative in turn declares the students graduates. After this declaration, the graduates are then awarded their diplomas.\n</p><p>The actual <a href=\"/wiki/Diploma\" title=\"Diploma\">diplomas</a> usually are not awarded during the ceremonies; the graduates get their diplomas and other pertinent papers after they have complied with their clearance. In the past, schools usually handed out rolls of paper tied with a ribbon, symbolizing the diplomas. A graduate came on stage when their name was called, accepted the diploma with their right hand, then transferred it to their left hand and shook the hand of the person awarding the diploma. The graduate then went front and center, held the roll of paper at a slant between their hands, left hand at the bottom and right hand at the top, and bowed, then went down the steps and back to their seat. Present trends, however, are for schools to give out leatherette diploma holders during the ceremony, thus eliminating the need for the formal bow and expediting the ceremony. After the awarding of diplomas, the class valedictorian then gives their valedictory address and leads the school pledge of loyalty. The graduates then sing their graduation song and the awards for outstanding graduates are then given out.\n</p><p>After the awards, the school <a href=\"/wiki/Head_teacher\" title=\"Head teacher\">principal</a> then gives the closing remarks and the graduates may sing their closing song. The students and parents then exit the area with a formal recessional. However, they then usually return to have their souvenir pictures taken on the stage.\n</p><p>Candlelight ceremonies are usually held during high school junior-senior (JS) proms. However, some elementary schools in the provinces made candlelight ceremonies part of the graduation rites. In the original candlelight ceremony for proms, the senior class president usually lit a large ceremonial candle on the stage, then lit their own candle from this flame and symbolically \u201cpassed the flame\u201d to the junior class president. The member of the senior class nearest the stage then went up to light their candle and went down to pass the flame to the other seniors, who would then give their lit candles to the juniors.\n</p><p>For elementary school <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Graduation_rites&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Graduation rites (page does not exist)\">graduation rites</a>, the graduating class sings \u201c<a href=\"/w/index.php?title=One_Little_Candle&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"One Little Candle (page does not exist)\">One Little Candle</a>\u201d while the class valedictorian lights the ceremonial candle then passes the flame to the other graduates. The graduates blow out the flame together when they are declared graduates.\n</p><p>The graduation song is a vital part of the ceremony. It is considered a symbol of the graduating class and is usually chosen by the graduates, although in some cases the class adviser or the teachers may choose the song themselves. The graduates usually try to choose a song that will express their feelings about graduation.\n</p><p>Some songs have been chosen over and over as graduation songs and in many cases have defined a generation. The Diana Ross song \u201c<a href=\"/w/index.php?title=If_We_Hold_On_Together&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"If We Hold On Together (page does not exist)\">If We Hold On Together</a>\u201d, for example, became the graduation song in many Philippine schools in the early 1990s. Other songs that Filipino students have chosen to sing during their graduation rites are \u201cFarewell\u201d by Raymond Lauchengco, \u201cThe Journey\u201d by <a href=\"/wiki/Lea_Salonga\" title=\"Lea Salonga\">Lea Salonga</a>, and \u201c<a href=\"/wiki/High_School_Life\" title=\"High School Life\">High School Life</a>\u201d by <a href=\"/wiki/Sharon_Cuneta\" title=\"Sharon Cuneta\">Sharon Cuneta</a>.\n</p><p>\u201c<a href=\"/wiki/Garland\" title=\"Garland\">Garlands</a>\u201d are essential to graduations in the <a href=\"/wiki/Philippines\" title=\"Philippines\">Philippines</a>. These are usually made from <a href=\"/wiki/Ribbon\" title=\"Ribbon\">ribbon</a>, shaped into a lei and adorned with \u201cflowers\u201d made from the same material. Fresh flowers are never used for graduation garlands, except for everlasting flowers. Some people create special garlands by tying individually wrapped candies end to end; these are usually popular with kindergarten and elementary school graduates. Recently, garlands made of seashells have also been given at graduation rites.\n</p><p>Many <a href=\"/wiki/High_schools\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"High schools\">high schools</a> now place stands beside the stage and hang garlands on them. When the graduates exit the stage after getting their diplomas, lowerclassmen usually put garlands on each of them. After the recessional, family and friends also place garlands around the necks of the graduates. Some people also give graduation gifts during this time; however, garlands are de rigueur.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"South_Africa\">South Africa</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Academic_graduation_by_country&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: South Africa\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>At the <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_the_Witwatersrand\" title=\"University of the Witwatersrand\">University of the Witwatersrand</a> (WITS), the graduation ceremonies are formal affairs, which include an academic procession by the faculty staff.

A speech by the chancellor/vice-chancellor towards the graduates is delivered at the start or towards the end of the ceremony.
