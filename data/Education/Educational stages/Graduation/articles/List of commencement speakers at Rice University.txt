In 2013, Rice University held its 100th commencement. Since 1986, commencements have been held in the Academic Quadrangle (weather permitting). Every commencement at Rice has included the hymns Veni Creator Spiritus and Lord of All Being, Throned Afar. From 1971 to 1990, Rice did not invite speakers to address graduates at commencement. During that time, addresses were given by university presidents Norman Hackerman (1971–1985) and George Rupp (1986–1990). From 1952 to 1985, commencements were held on the east side (lawn) of Lovett Hall. In 1951, commencement was held in Autry Court. From 1935 to 1950, commencements were held in courtyard of the Chemistry Laboratories (now Keck Hall). From 1916 to 1948, commencements were held on Monday, preceded by a Baccalaureate sermon on Sunday. From 1942 to 1946, addresses were delivered by William Vermillion Houston, President of Rice Institute. In 1944 and 1946, Rice held two commencement ceremonies each year as part of a “wartime speed-up educational program.”  From 1916 to 1934, commencements were held in the Academic Quadrangle.
