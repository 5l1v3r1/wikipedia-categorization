The Augustinian Secondary Education Association (ASEA) is an organization founded in 1986 to "foster unity, efficiency, and continued development within the Augustinian ministry to secondary education" in North America.  It operates without a budget, acting as a forum for member institutions to share resources, implement Augustinian ideals in the curriculum of its institutions, and to ensure that its member institutions present an "authentic Augustinian identity".  It is based in Ojai, California,  and reports to the Federation of Augustinians of North America (FANA). Its activity consists of informal networking and inservice programs, as well as annual meetings.  ASEA has eleven member institutions, of which ten are in the United States and one is in Canada. Of these, Austin Catholic Academy and St. Thomas of Villanova College are independently operated and not officially sponsored by the Augustinian Order.  The association operates the Augustinian Values Institute, a program to define the mission and values for Augustinian schools.  The three core principles are "unitas", "veritas", and "caritas" (unity, truth, and charity).
