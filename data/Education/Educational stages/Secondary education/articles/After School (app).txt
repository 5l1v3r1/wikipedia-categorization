After School  is an iOS and Android social network mobile application that allows users in a defined network, currently high schools, to share anonymous text-based posts and images with others.  As of July 2016, After School had users at more than 20,000 american high schools.  According to CEO Michael Callahan, the app was created as a network “that teens could use to express themselves, to reach out to others and to ask for and offer help to fellow teens in distress.”  The app, created by Michael Callahan and Cory Levy of ONE, Inc., debuted in mid-November 2014. In the re-release of the app in April 2015,  After School implemented “mature content” filters, age verification, 24/7 live anonymous support, and FIRST (Fastest Internet Response System for Threats).  In February 2016, After School announced raising a $16.4 million Series A round.  The app also detects threatening or harmful messages using "language algorithms"  and "enforces a single-report immediate user removal for violations."
