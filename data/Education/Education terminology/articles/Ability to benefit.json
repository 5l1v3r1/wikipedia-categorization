ATB, as assessed by government-approved tests, is required for receiving financial aid by most US public colleges that admit students without a high school diploma or the certificate of equivalency. Until July 2012, such students could also receive student loans and grants from the US government if they had passed an approved ATB examination. However, the provision was dropped as part of the cuts to the Federal budget for fiscal year 2012.<sup id=\"cite_ref-IHE1_1-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-IHE1-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In some US states such as <a href=\"/wiki/California\" title=\"California\">California</a>, even when such students are not requesting financial aid, private post-secondary institutions are \"required, prior to executing an enrollment agreement with an ATB student, to have the student take and pass an independently administered examination from the list of examinations prescribed by the <a href=\"/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Education\" title=\"United States Department of Education\">United States Department of Education</a>\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>According to <i><a href=\"/wiki/Inside_Higher_Ed\" title=\"Inside Higher Ed\">Inside Higher Ed</a></i>, in 2012 about 82,000 students at US public two-year colleges had been admitted under ATB (approximately 1% of the total <a href=\"/wiki/Community_college\" title=\"Community college\">community college</a> population) although not all of them were receiving financial aid.
