The "Nines Club" describes people who have achieved third class honours results in each of their three years of a standard length Bachelor's degree whilst at University.   Bachelor's degree candidates who achieve a result not within the 3rd class bracket (normally 40 to 50%) in any of their three years do not qualify for the "Nines Club". The term is normally reserved for Bachelor's degree candidates who attended Oxford or Cambridge Universities. Carol Vorderman, having studied Engineering at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge and co-presented Countdown alongside Richard Whiteley, is a noted member of the "Nines Club".
