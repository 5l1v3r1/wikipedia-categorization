Local education agency (LEA) is a commonly used acronym for a school district, an entity which operates local public primary and secondary schools in the United States, or provides government services to schools within a local area in the United Kingdom.  In some instances, LEA is used to refer to an individual school, especially a charter school, though this usage is less common.
