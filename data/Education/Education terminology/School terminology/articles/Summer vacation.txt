Summer vacation (also called summer holiday or summer break) is a school holiday in summer between school years and the break in the school year. Students and instructors are off school from doing work typically between 8 and 9 weeks, depending on the country and district. In the United States, summer break is approximately 2.5 to 3 months, with students typically getting out of school between late May and mid-June and starting the new school year between mid-August and early September. In Republic of Ireland, Italy, Greece, Lithuania, Latvia, Lebanon, Romania and Russia, the summer break is normally three months, compared to six to eight weeks in Australia, Britain, Canada,Pakistan, India, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Germany. In some countries, school summer vacation is only six weeks or two months supposedly so students do not forget large amounts of information learned in the past year (See: Summer learning loss).   Other education reformers believed that children were overstimulated in a system which required 48 weeks of schooling. They believe that over-schooling could lead to nervous disorders, depression, insanity, and separation anxiety towards families.  They believe that children need the 2–3 months off to relax and also to take a break from other childhood stresses associated with school such as peer pressure, cliques, bullying, and the pressure of heavy loads of homework. Some critics of summer vacation point out that American students spend approximately 180 days (26 weeks) per year in school, but Asian students are "in school for 240 to 250 days". This is consistent with the conclusions of researchers who suggest that advanced abilities are in proportion to the time spent learning. Summer holidays in Japan start from late July until early September.  In Southern Argentina, the school year ends in early- or mid-December and starts late February or early March. Also the majority of students get two weeks of holidays during winter, which varies depending on the region of the country from early June to late July or mid-July to early August. In Australia, summer officially lasts from December to February, and therefore includes Christmas and New Year holidays. The dates of Australian school holidays (the term used, rather than "vacation") are determined by each state's Department of Education, the Christmas summer holiday being the longest in duration. Typically Christmas summer holiday in Australia last approximately six weeks, usually from late December (depending on school level) to late January. This is significantly shorter than North American summer holiday, but Australian schools also break for 2 weeks at Easter, and in June and September, giving students and teachers a total of twelve weeks of annual holidays. In many public schools, years 10 through 12 will finish before December 15, allowing time to complete exam marking and results. Year 10 commonly finishes at the end of November, Year 11 at the end of October, and year 12 (Senior Year) also at mid or the end of October after 3 weeks of end-of-year exams. This can bring the normal 12 weeks of vacation to 20 weeks of vacation. The intervening periods of school operation without holidays are called "School Terms", each term lasting approximately ten weeks. All Australian states have relatively similar holiday periods between each term, but there is the ability for this to change, as it did in the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games, when the first term in Victorian schools was shortened to 6 weeks and the other subsequently extended to 12 weeks due to severe disruptions to the public and private bus networks used by school students. Most private schools in Australia have up to four weeks of additional holidays, due to their longer teaching hours during term. In Austria, summer vacation dates vary by region, however the break lasts nine weeks throughout the whole country. School usually ends in early July and starts in early September. In the regions of Vienna, Lower Austria and the Burgenland summer break starts on the first Saturday in July and one week later in Carinthia, Styria, the Tyrol, Vorarlberg, Salzburg and Upper Austria. School recommences on the first Monday in September in Vienna, Lower Austria and the Burgenland and on the second Monday of September in the other regions. In Bangladesh, summer vacation begins in mid-May and ends in mid June (4 weeks). According to Bengali calendar summer vacation related with availability of different kinds of summer fruits in the month of Joishtho (mid May to mid June). This is slightly odd for schools to open before the summer solstice begins. Also, it is becoming difficult for children to attend school in high temperatures. In Barbados, summer holiday dates have varied throughout the years due to the beginning of the hurricane season on June 1st. Because of this, major storms affecting the island can cause schools to remain closed for days resulting in a pushback of vacation dates, for example with Hurricane Tomas in 2010. Currently, summer holiday begins in late June or early July and ends in the second week of September. In Belgium, summer vacation lasts in general from July 1 until September 1 (2 months).

The following periods are applied: 1st grade: May 24 – September 15 2nd-4th grade: May 31 – September 15 5th-7th grade: June 15 – September 15 8th-11th grade: June 30 – September 15 12th grade: School year ends in mid-May. Note that 8th grade classes that focus on intensive language learning's summer vacation also starts on the 30th of June, rather than the 15th.  In Canada, the first day of summer vacation for public schools is the last Saturday in June. However, in some provinces students get a Professional Activity day on the final Friday of that school week, and their last day would be on the Thursday.

The "first-term break" starts between one and two weeks prior to Christmas and ends the first or second week in January, lasting for about three weeks. The "first-term break" is usually the shortest break in a school year. The "second-term break" usually starts a week before Easter and lasts for another three weeks. This gives a total of about 14 weeks of holiday in a year. The geographical location of the school is also a factor. Tertiary institutions follow a different pattern, as the holiday in each school depends on various factors which include, the Course of study and the academic calendar of the school. Some tertiary institutions observe their Summer breaks in the normal summer period when elementary and high schools observe theirs, while others do not. Some courses of study also do not observe any significant holidays, such programmes include Engineering, Nursing, Medicine and a few others. This is usually as a result of students doing their laboratory work, workshop practice, Practicals, Internship etc. (as the case may be), while the other students in other programmes are on holiday. Tertiary schools observe two semesters; while some schools observe a break after the first semester, many others have their breaks combined to just the summer holidays. This long break helps the students get good jobs during the holiday. The total length of break observed in tertiary institutions in a year is 12 to 14 weeks.

In addition, all schools in the United Kingdom have three week-long half-term breaks for each of the three terms, including one in the autumn term at the end of October, one in the spring term in mid-February and one in the summer term in late May, although these breaks do not always coincide with state school breaks in the Autumn and Spring terms. The summer half term break is determined by the break in public exams at the end of May. Some universities grant an extended "Exam-Leave" to students which typically commences in early April, so as to give students a good number of weeks to prepare for the summer exam season which usually starts in mid to late May and finishes in early or mid-June. Final-year students at independent schools typically finish their time at school when their last exam in the summer exam season finishes, and as an encore a special event is usually arranged for late June by the school for leavers and staff as a way of providing an opportunity for final farewells to be bid. The universities they go on to typically schedule their first term to commence in early October, giving school leavers an extended summer break between their time of leaving school and starting university. In the United States, summer vacation lasts two to three months. The dates vary depending on the location of the school district, with two major formats. One is from late May-mid June to early September (in most northern states), the other major format lasting from late May to mid August (in most southern and western states). (Excluding some districts, as some schools may end late June and begin early September). Summer vacation or break lasts for about 12 weeks, starting anywhere from late May to mid June, and ending anywhere from late August to Labor Day, the first Monday in September. This often depends on the region – for example, most schools in the Northeastern United States end in June and start the Wednesday after Labor Day (Teachers report back on Tuesday), while the majority of schools in the Southern United States have schools end in May and start again in August. The origins of the summer holiday break are often believed to be rooted in agriculture. It is widely believed that the school calendar follows the agrarian farming calendar because during the settlement of the United States, the nation primarily consisted of a farming population.  This belief maintains that the current school calendar has a two to three-month break so that children could assume the necessary tasks of planting and harvesting crops. However, planting of most crops occurred in the spring and harvest occurred in the fall.  Rural schools would often break for spring and fall seasons, but continue schooling throughout the summer.   The modern school calendar has roots in 19th century school reform movements seeking standardization between urban and rural areas; multiple causes lead to the summer break known by modern American students. In fact, schools in the early 1800s held school throughout the summer.  As schooling progressed through bureaucracy, society’s population growth and change, as well as improvements in technology, such as better transportation for students and air conditioned buildings, school calendars also changed.   Many citizens of upper and middle classes would vacation outside of the sweltering cities during the hot summers.  If school continued into the summer months, families would no longer have time together for summer vacations.  As school systems grew throughout the United States they became more aligned with college and university schedules, which already observed a break during summer. Breaks became more frequent as well.  Original schools observed New Year’s Day, Easter, Fourth of July, Thanksgiving, and Christmas.  The duration of breaks at these observances varied from school to school.  More observances have been honored as time has passed, continually changing the school calendar.  As the nation expanded and grew, the nation saw the need for an educated populace and more public schools were built.  But the need for academic breaks from learning was always seen as necessary. Nineteenth century and early twentieth century belief regarded the brain as a muscle, and thought that too much work and strain on the brain could result in injury.  Therefore, they believed that students should not receive too much education.  This was particularly true of younger children whose minds were still developing.  As industrialism led to automation and wealth, and the nation recovered and expanded following the Civil War, leisure activity became more important to Americans.  Leading advocates for play such as Henry Curtis   believed strongly that children were not having enough time for play.  In addition to advocating playground equipment, Curtis also advocated that summer should be spent working with families in gardens, and going camping.  Curtis was a large supporter of boy and girl scouts and encouraged children to engage in scouting during the summer.  If children lived in the cities and were unable to go camping or tend to gardens, schools were a premier place for children to be, but the emphasis should be on learning lifelong skills; sewing, woodworking, crafts, and manual labor.
