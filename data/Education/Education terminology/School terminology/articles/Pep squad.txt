Pep squads are found in high schools, middle schools and sometimes elementary schools in the United States. The pep squad's main duty is to promote school spirit. Pep squad members make posters, cheer for school sports teams, and help with pep rallies. During games, pep squads lead cheers and chants. A pep squad is often similar to a cheerleading squad, but is usually a separate organization. In some cases, a dance team serves as a pep squad. Pep squads and cheerleaders often perform the same or similar kinds of routine, although they differ in costume and style. Pep squad uniforms vary by school. A traditional uniform is a skirt and a top in school colors. Sometimes pep squads use pom-poms. Some squads, especially those that perform intensive dance routines, wear colorful dance costumes.
