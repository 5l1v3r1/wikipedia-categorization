 A thesis statement  usually appears at the middle or end  of the introductory paragraph of a paper, and it offers a concise summary of the main point or claim of the essay, research paper, etc. It is usually expressed in one sentence, and the statement may be reiterated elsewhere. It contains the topic and the controlling idea.   There are two types of thesis statements: direct and indirect. The indirect thesis statements does not state the explicit reasons, while the direct thesis statement does. If I write, "I love New York for three reasons," the fact that I love New York is the topic, and "three reasons" are an indirect thesis statement. The essay will contain the three reasons. If I write, "I love New York because of the food, the jazz clubs and the Broadway Shows," that's a direct thesis statement that tells what each section or body paragraph is going to be about.    The thesis statement is developed, supported, and explained in the course of the paper by means of examples and evidence. Thesis statements help organize and develop the body of the writing piece. They let readers know what the writer's statement is and what it is aiming to prove. A thesis statement does not necessarily forecast organization of an essay which can be more complex than its purpose. The thesis statement will reflect the kind of paper being written. There are three kinds of papers: analytical, expository, and argumentative. The structure of a thesis statement depends upon the nature of controlling essay type. In simple terms, first a thesis statement will have a main topic sentence formed from questioning it, then the writer's statement regarding the topic sentence, and finally ends with the specific supporting points detailing the writer's statement for justifying its relation with the topic sentence. In general, it should have a supportable opinion (specific/focused) and clear intent for the essay.
