ASU is an organization which was established on basis of international experience and it was the first student organization which united students irrespective of gender, race, creed, nationality.\n</p><p>During its action period ASU has formed stable structure, presented new suggestions about student policy to appropriate bodies, made close relations with international and regional student organizations, prepared new action plan according to the universities-students-companies' relations in Azerbaijan.\n</p><p>ASU considered international relations very important. For the first time ASU's delegates were participants of the First Asia IAESTE Forum in Shanghai during 12\u201315 November 2009. After that forum ASU established close relations with IAESTE which is one of the biggest student exchange organizations. As a result of relations on 21 January 2010 ASU was accepted a member of IAESTE. Our union gained right to represent Azerbaijan students in IAESTE. That membership was the union's first success on international level. During 20\u201327 January Azerbaijan Students Union was accepted as associative member of IAESTE in 64th Annual Conference in Thailand.

These vocational institutions offer 3-4 year 'professional bachelor's degrees'. Besides that there are a number of art schools. Universities belong under the Ministry of Science, University Colleges belong under the Ministry of Education, and the Art Schools belong under the Ministry of Culture. There are 12 universities at the moment, but in 2006 there is a major merger process going on to make fewer, bigger institutions.

The student union is autonomous, its internal life organized by its by-laws. The student unions are responsible for all representation of the students and elect the student members of different administrative organs. They usually coordinate and finance the activities of smaller, more specialized student organizations.

The main objective of a student union is to solve students' problems that can either be related to academic life or have a general political and social nature. Furthermore, Student Unions organize and support numerous activities such as political debates, demonstrations, university occupations, educational lectures, cultural and artistic events, conferences and so on.\n</p><p>The structure of a Student Union is rather simple and comprises two bodies: <a href=\"/wiki/The_General_Students%27_Assembly_(Greece)\" title=\"The General Students&#39; Assembly (Greece)\">The General Students' Assembly (Greece)</a> and the <a href=\"/wiki/Board_of_directors\" title=\"Board of directors\">board of directors</a>. The <b>General Assembly</b> consists of all student-members of the Union. It takes place on a regular basis and is the only decision-making body. During the General Assembly, many topics of student interest are discussed and the decisions are taken after open vote. The <b>Board of Directors</b> makes sure that the decisions of the General Assembly will be materialized. Moreover, the members of the board of directors, among which is the Union's President, participate in various university administrative bodies as representatives of all students in the Union.\n</p><p>Every year in early spring the Student Elections take place nationwide, during which students vote for their representatives. All Student Unions in Greece are members of the \"National Student Union of Greece\" (\u0395\u03a6\u0395\u0395 - \u0395\u03b8\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03a6\u03bf\u03b9\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u0388\u03bd\u03c9\u03c3\u03b7 \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac\u03b4\u03b1\u03c2).\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Ireland\">Ireland</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Students%27_union&amp;action=edit&amp;section=23\" title=\"Edit section: Ireland\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Student%27s_Union_Queen%27s.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Student%27s_Union_Queen%27s.jpg/220px-Student%27s_Union_Queen%27s.jpg\" width=\"220\" height=\"123\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Student%27s_Union_Queen%27s.jpg/330px-Student%27s_Union_Queen%27s.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Student%27s_Union_Queen%27s.jpg/440px-Student%27s_Union_Queen%27s.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"2844\" data-file-height=\"1588\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Student%27s_Union_Queen%27s.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div><a href=\"/wiki/Queen%27s_University_Belfast_Students%27_Union\" title=\"Queen&#39;s University Belfast Students&#39; Union\">Queen's University Belfast Students' Union</a> Building</div></div></div>\n<p>Most of <a href=\"/wiki/Ireland\" title=\"Ireland\">Ireland</a>'s <a href=\"/wiki/List_of_higher_education_institutions_in_the_Republic_of_Ireland\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"List of higher education institutions in the Republic of Ireland\">universities and colleges</a> have students' unions which were established to represent the students in the context of internal college issues and on wider student related issues and also a means of solidarity with other movements globally.
