The Leading Edge Partnership programme was established in 2003 by the Department for Children, Schools and Families in the United Kingdom. The programme's intention was to encourage Secondary schools in England to work in partnership to solve some problems in education. In 2005 the programme expanded. The programme encourages schools to work to raise achievement through the sharing of proven ideas. There are over 300 Leading Edge schools within the programme.
