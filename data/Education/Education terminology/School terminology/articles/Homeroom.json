Often these tasks include the collection or distribution of homework or the cleaning of the classroom. In competitive schools, the composition of home room classes is sometime based on ability in one or more core subjects. For example, students with a talent for science and math might be grouped together in one home room, while students with more practical or artistic skills would be put together in another. In such cases, the class' home room teacher often specializes in one of the core areas used to select his or her class, in addition to provide both academic and life advises to students. Usually there will also be a student elected by the others as a class monitor to assist their teachers with homeroom tasks and act as intermediate between the teachers and students.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"India\"><a href=\"/wiki/Education_in_India\" title=\"Education in India\">India</a></span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Homeroom&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: India\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In India a homeroom teacher is referred to as a class teacher.

Homeroom teachers play many roles; acting as counselors, administrators, and disciplinarians. Homeroom classes in high school are specially important as the students make their transition to college. Homeroom hour starts before 1st period and also after the last period, lasting between 20\u201330 minutes each time. Teachers use this time to make announcements, discipline students, and take care of other administrative duties. More importantly, teachers take this time to establish order in class. If a teacher is easygoing, the class is likely to be disruptive. Likewise, if the teacher is strict, the class is likely to be orderly. School administrators and staff see the homeroom classes as a reflection of the teachers.  Moreover, if the class has bad test scores, it is subsequently blamed on the teacher. The homeroom teacher is responsible for pushing the students to do their best. Students often see their homeroom teachers as their role models and often visit them in the staff room. It is also common for students to stop by to tease the teacher or ask frivolous questions. In the 12th grade, homeroom teachers especially press on the students to do well on their college entrance exam.  The 12th grade homeroom teacher is considered to be the most important teacher in the student's education. Subsequently, they (12th grade teachers) have a lot of work and are reluctant to take on teaching this grade. After graduating, students often come back and visit their homeroom teachers. It is customary to come with gifts or food.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Japan\"><a href=\"/wiki/Education_in_Japan\" title=\"Education in Japan\">Japan</a></span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Homeroom&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Japan\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Home room in Japanese schools forms a greater part of students' lives, with home room teachers acting as a substitute parent in many ways. Students usually have the same home room teacher and fellow students during their entire life at a given school. Students are expected to take on tasks for their home room, including cleaning, day duty (note-taking and classroom organisation), and the organisation of competitive events between home room classes. Students also often eat lunch in their home room. Since teachers must usually travel to the students' home room, rather than students going to a classroom dedicated to a particular subject, the depth of lessons often suffers. Teachers must carry all materials needed for multiple classes, therefore the lessons usually end up taking on a lecture style with students simply taking notes in preparation for testing.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Singapore\"><a href=\"/wiki/Education_in_Singapore\" title=\"Education in Singapore\">Singapore</a></span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Homeroom&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: Singapore\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Homeroom periods varies between schools in <a href=\"/wiki/Singapore\" title=\"Singapore\">Singapore</a>.

Students usually stay in groups of 20 to 40 for at least 2 years without being reshuffled and often maintain the same grouping throughout both primary and secondary education, with only the group's room and assigned member of staff changing.\nTypically, <a href=\"/wiki/Argentina\" title=\"Argentina\">Argentine</a> schools will have a 15-30 minute <b>form period</b> in the morning, a one-hour period for lunch, and a similar period after lunch, albeit not all schools are required to have classes in both the morning and the afternoon.  Schools (particularly private ones) will often use classes in the afternoon for secondary languages (English, French, etc.) and sports activities.\nStudents are usually not given much choice in the subjects they study and they all are subject to most academic subjects.  The main choice a student has to make in entering secondary high school is in deciding a high school that leans towards general knowledge (\"bachiller\", which encompasses arts and a general overview of science), economics (\"comercial\", whose orientation is towards math, primarily oriented towards accounting and business), engineering (\"tecnico\" whose orientation is towards engineering and sciences) or pedagogical(\"normal\", whose orientation is forming elementary school teachers).  Each school is given a lot of latitude in terms of extracurricular activities (teaching of secondary languages, sports, etc.).\nArgentinian's education is often in flux, as governments every 5 years or so change the curriculum and number of required classes.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Australia\"><a href=\"/wiki/Education_in_Australia\" title=\"Education in Australia\">Australia</a></span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Homeroom&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12\" title=\"Edit section: Australia\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Home room in Australia is similar to the US concept, however it varies from school to school.

Some schools do have an hour a week of homeroom, being called \"tutor\u00eda\", which is usually placed in High School education.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"United_Kingdom\"><a href=\"/wiki/Education_in_the_United_Kingdom\" title=\"Education in the United Kingdom\">United Kingdom</a></span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Homeroom&amp;action=edit&amp;section=24\" title=\"Edit section: United Kingdom\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Although the term homeroom is not used in the <a href=\"/wiki/United_Kingdom\" title=\"United Kingdom\">UK</a>, students are usually assigned to a <a href=\"/wiki/Tutor_group\" title=\"Tutor group\">tutor group</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Form_(education)\" title=\"Form (education)\">form</a>, with a daily registration period which serves generally the same purpose as a home room. The groupings and activities within a tutor group vary between schools and age groups; generally speaking primary students remain in their form groups for the majority of the time and there is no clear 'form time'. In secondary school, registration periods (or extensions thereof, such as weekly tutorials) may be the only period a form has with their form tutor - their first point of pastoral contact within a school - and the time is often used for a variety of purposes from administration (taking the register, making announcements, university and career applications) to more general studies such as personal, social and health education.\n</p><p>In Scotland, the use of SEEMIS software to monitor attendance has been trialed, which may lead to more integrated period-by-period registration of pupils.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Netherlands\"><a href=\"/wiki/Education_in_the_Netherlands\" title=\"Education in the Netherlands\">The Netherlands</a></span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Homeroom&amp;action=edit&amp;section=25\" title=\"Edit section: The Netherlands\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In the Netherlands, the students are put in a group which more or less stays the same during their high school career. Those groups are sorted in levels, depending on a test children take at the end of primary school and their teachers' advice. Those levels determine how long you stay in high school and what kind of school you can attend after high school. Usually, the only reason to switch groups is when you go up a level or drop a level at the end of a year, based on your grades and performance. \nSo students always take all classes with the exact same group, have lunch breaks at the same time etcetera.\n</p><p>Each group is assigned a mentor, which is a teacher who teaches a certain subject to multiple groups of all levels. In the mean time, those mentors are responsible for their students well-being, grades and performances, the group dynamics and more. They also are there to advice students regarding choices they have to make like what school to go to next or what career to pick, help them with personal issues and most of them plan a few fun activities or trips during the schoolyear. \nAll of this has to happen during the mentor's own class. There is no homeroom. \nSome schools however schedule a mentor class once a week or once a month, and most mentor's make room to talk to each student once or twice in private before or after school. \n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Homeroom&amp;action=edit&amp;section=26\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><cite class=\"citation book\">Hsu, Wu, Shihkuan, Yuh-Yin. <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=EcEUBQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=copyright\"><i>Education as Cultivation in Chinese Culture</i></a>.
