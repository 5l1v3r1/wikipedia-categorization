The Oxford Set of Mathematical Instruments is a set of instruments used by generations of school children in the United Kingdom and around the world in mathematics and geometry lessons. The set is marketed in over 100 countries by Helix, a company based in Stourbridge, West Midlands. It consists of a metal tin embossed on the front with a drawing of Balliol College and the words 'THE HELIX OXFORD SET OF MATHEMATICAL INSTRUMENTS COMPLETE & ACCURATE' in white against a blue background. Inside the tin there are two set squares, a 180° protractor, a 15 cm ruler, a metal compass,  a 9 cm pencil, a pencil sharpener, an eraser and a 10mm stencil. (In the 1970s a stencil for drawing chemical apparatus was included.) There is also a fact sheet and glossary of mathematical terms with a school timetable printed on the back. The export version also includes dividers.
