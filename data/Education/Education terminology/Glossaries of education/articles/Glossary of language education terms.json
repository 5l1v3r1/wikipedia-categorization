Chomsky\u2019s theories of knowledge of language and language acquisition relate as much to the study of human nature as to language teaching. As Steven Pinker explains<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources. (April 2010)\">citation needed</span></a></i>&#93;</sup>,\nChomsky\u2019s claim that\u2026all humans speak a single language is based on the hypothesis that the same symbol-manipulating machinery, without exception, underlies the world\u2019s languages. Linguists have long known that the basic design features of language are found everywhere\u2026 A common grammatical code, neutral between production and comprehension, allows speakers to produce any linguistic message they can understand, and vice versa. Words have stable meanings, linked to them by arbitrary convention\u2026.Languages can convey meanings that are abstract and remote in time or space from the speaker, (and) linguistic forms are infinite in number.</dd>\n\n<dt class=\"glossary\" id=\"chorus\" style=\"margin-top: 0.4em;\"><dfn class=\"glossary\">Chorus</dfn></dt>\n<dd class=\"glossary\">Speaking together as a group; used in choral speaking and jazz chants.</dd>\n\n<dt class=\"glossary\" id=\"classroom_climate\" style=\"margin-top: 0.4em;\"><dfn class=\"glossary\">Classroom climate</dfn></dt>\n<dd class=\"glossary\">Environment created in the classroom by factors such as the physical environment and also the interrelationship between the teacher and the students, and among the students.</dd>\n\n<dt class=\"glossary\" id=\"classroom_management\" style=\"margin-top: 0.4em;\"><dfn class=\"glossary\">Classroom management</dfn></dt>\n<dd class=\"glossary\">The management of classroom processes such as how the teacher sets up the classroom and organizes teaching and learning to facilitate instruction.

Communicative competence has four parts, which we call language competencies.\n\n<ol><li><b>Grammatical competence</b> is how well a person has learned that features and rules of the language. This includes vocabulary, pronunciation, and sentence formation. The main question is: How well does a person understand English grammar?</li>\n<li><b>Sociolinguistic competence</b> is how well a person speaks and is understood in various social contexts. This depends on factors such as status of those speaking to each other, the purpose of the interaction, and the expectations of the interaction. The main question is: how socially acceptable is the person\u2019s use of English in different settings?</li>\n<li><b>Discourse competence</b> is how well a person can combine grammatical forms and meanings to achieve different types (genres) of speaking or writing. The main question is: How well does one properly combine all the languages elements to speak or write in English?</li>\n<li><b>Strategic competence</b> is how well the person uses both verbal forms and non-verbal communication to compensate for lack of knowledge in the other three competencies. The main question is: Can a person find ways to communicate when he or she is lacking some knowledge of English?</li></ol></dd>\n\n<dt class=\"glossary\" id=\"communicative_language_teaching\" style=\"margin-top: 0.4em;\"><dfn class=\"glossary\"><a href=\"/wiki/Communicative_language_teaching\" title=\"Communicative language teaching\">Communicative Language Teaching</a> <span id=\"CLT\"></span><span id=\"Communicative_language_teaching\"></span></dfn></dt>\n<dd class=\"glossary\">Communicative language teaching (CLT) is an approach to foreign or second language learning which emphasizes that the goal of language learning is communicative competence. The communicative approach has been developed particularly by British applied linguists as a reaction away from grammar-based approaches such as the aural-oral (audio-lingual) approach. Teaching materials used with a communicative approach teach the language needed to express and understand different kinds of functions, such as requesting, describing, expressing likes and dislikes, etc. Also, they emphasize the processes of communication, such as using language appropriately in different types of situations; using language to perform different kinds of tasks, e.g. to solve puzzles, to get information, etc.; using language for social interaction with other people.</dd>\n\n<dt class=\"glossary\" id=\"competence_learning_model\" style=\"margin-top: 0.4em;\"><dfn class=\"glossary\">Competence learning model</dfn></dt>\n<dd class=\"glossary\">Especially when we take specialized courses, learning seems to take place in four stages. We begin with unconscious incompetence: we do not know how much we do not know. Once we begin our course of studies, we become consciously incompetent: we know how much we do not know. From there we proceed to conscious competence: we have functional knowledge and can perform competently, but we have to think about what we are doing. Finally, after we have had enough experience, we become unconsciously competent: we know it and we can do it, and we do not much have to think about it. This model applies to a great deal of language learning, to TEFL training and to many other areas of study.</dd>\n\n<dt class=\"glossary\" id=\"comprehensible_input\" style=\"margin-top: 0.4em;\"><dfn class=\"glossary\">Comprehensible input</dfn></dt>\n<dd class=\"glossary\">Language that is understandable to learners.</dd>\n\n<dt class=\"glossary\" id=\"content_words\" style=\"margin-top: 0.4em;\"><dfn class=\"glossary\">Content words</dfn></dt>\n<dd class=\"glossary\">Words that carry meaning; usually nouns, verbs and sometimes adjectives and adverbs.</dd>\n\n<dt class=\"glossary\" id=\"context_clues\" style=\"margin-top: 0.4em;\"><dfn class=\"glossary\">Context clues</dfn></dt>\n<dd class=\"glossary\">Clues used when guessing word meanings; clues that provide students with meaning or comprehension based on the environment in which a word is found.</dd>\n\n<dt class=\"glossary\" id=\"contrastive_analysis\" style=\"margin-top: 0.4em;\"><dfn class=\"glossary\"><a href=\"/wiki/Contrastive_analysis\" title=\"Contrastive analysis\">Contrastive analysis</a></dfn></dt>\n<dd class=\"glossary\">Comparing two languages to predict where learning will be facilitated and hindered.</dd>\n\n<dt class=\"glossary\" id=\"controlled_practice\" style=\"margin-top: 0.4em;\"><dfn class=\"glossary\">Controlled practice</dfn></dt>\n<dd class=\"glossary\">Language practise where the students are restricted in their choice of language, usually to a single answer, for example a gap fill.

The teacher writes down the information they provide, and then uses the account to teach language, especially to develop reading skills.</dd>\n\n<dt class=\"glossary\" id=\"language_learning_requirements\" style=\"margin-top: 0.4em;\"><dfn class=\"glossary\">Language learning requirements</dfn></dt>\n<dd class=\"glossary\">To learn language, students have four needs: They must be exposed to the language. They must understand its meaning and structure. And they must practice it. Teachers should hold their students as able. They should not over-explain or make things too easy. Learning comes through discovery.</dd>\n\n<dt class=\"glossary\" id=\"language_skills\" style=\"margin-top: 0.4em;\"><dfn class=\"glossary\"><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Language_skills&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Language skills (page does not exist)\">Language skills</a></dfn></dt>\n<dd class=\"glossary\">In language teaching, this refers to the mode or manner in which language is used. Listening, speaking, reading and writing are generally called the four language skills. Speaking and writing are the productive skills, while reading and listening are the receptive skills. Often the skills are divided into sub-skills, such as discriminating sounds in connected speech, or understanding relationships within a sentence.</dd>\n\n<dt class=\"glossary\" id=\"learning_burden\" style=\"margin-top: 0.4em;\"><dfn class=\"glossary\">Learning burden</dfn></dt>\n<dd class=\"glossary\">These are the features of the word that the teacher actually needs to be taught, and can differ dramatically from word to word. Especially in lexis, the teacher needs to reduce learning burden by, for example, reducing the number of definitions and uses presented.</dd>\n\n<dt class=\"glossary\" id=\"learning_factors\" style=\"margin-top: 0.4em;\"><dfn class=\"glossary\">Learning factors</dfn></dt>\n<dd class=\"glossary\">For EFL teachers, four factors outside aptitude and attitude affect the rate at which a student learns a second language. These are (1) the student\u2019s motivation, including whether it is instrumental or integrative; (2) the amount of time the student spends in class and practicing the language outside class; (3) the teacher\u2019s approach to teaching; and (4) the teacher\u2019s effectiveness and teaching style. The most important of these motivators are the first two, which are also the two the teacher has least control over.

The teacher\u2019s primary focus must be on effective ways to have the student practice using his or her language. Classes should be planned so they enable the student to use just a little more language than they are comfortable with. This is known as \u201ci+1\u201d \u2013 an idea popularized by Stephen Krashen.

See a fuller description at <a href=\"/wiki/English_language_learning_and_teaching\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"English language learning and teaching\">English language learning and teaching</a>.  TEFL <b>usually</b> takes place in non-English-speaking countries, while TESL takes place in the English-speaking world. \nWhen we speak of English as a foreign language (EFL), we are referring to the role of English for learners in a country where English is not spoken by the majority (what <a href=\"/wiki/Braj_Kachru\" title=\"Braj Kachru\">Braj Kachru</a> calls the expanding circle).  English as a second language (ESL) refers to the role of English for learners in an English-speaking country, i.e. usually <a href=\"/wiki/Immigrants\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Immigrants\">immigrants</a>. This difference is very important, because it strongly affects student motivation. In particular, it affects their motivation to learn.\n\n\tIn non-English speaking countries, students have instrumental motivation, the desire to learn English to accomplish a goal. They may want to improve their job prospects, for example, or to speak to tourists. They\n1.\tattend English classes with other non-native speakers\n2.\tcan find reasonable work without English; have less economic incentive to learn English.\n3.\tdo not need English in daily life\n4.\thave both primary and secondary support-networks that function in their native language\n5.\thave fewer opportunities to practice using their English\nThey are learning, and their instructors are teaching, English as a <a href=\"/wiki/Foreign_language\" title=\"Foreign language\">foreign language</a>.\n\n\tIn English-speaking countries, they have integrative motivation, the desire to learn the language to fit into an English-language culture. They are more likely to want to integrate because they\n1.\tGenerally have more friends and family with English language skills.\n2.\tHave immediate financial and economic incentives to learn English.\n3.\tHave more opportunities to practice English.\n4.\tNeed it in daily life; often require it for work.\n5.\tOften attend English classes with students who speak a wide range of mother tongues.\nThey are learning, and their instructors are teaching, English as a <a href=\"/wiki/Second_language\" title=\"Second language\">second language</a>.</dd>\n\n<dt class=\"glossary\" id=\"technique\" style=\"margin-top: 0.4em;\"><dfn class=\"glossary\">Technique</dfn></dt>\n<dd class=\"glossary\">A way of presenting language.</dd>\n\n<dt class=\"glossary\" id=\"thematic_syllabus\" style=\"margin-top: 0.4em;\"><dfn class=\"glossary\">Thematic syllabus</dfn></dt>\n<dd class=\"glossary\">Syllabus based on themes or topics of interest to the students.</dd>\n\n<dt class=\"glossary\" id=\"top-down_information_processing\" style=\"margin-top: 0.4em;\"><dfn class=\"glossary\">Top-down information processing</dfn></dt>\n<dd class=\"glossary\">Students learn partially through top-down information processing, or processing based on how students make sense of language input \u2013 for example, through using students\u2019 previous knowledge or schema.</dd>\n\n<dt class=\"glossary\" id=\"uninterrupted_sustained_silent_writing\" style=\"margin-top: 0.4em;\"><dfn class=\"glossary\">Uninterrupted sustained silent writing</dfn></dt>\n<dd class=\"glossary\">A technique in writing whereby a specified, relatively short period of time is set aside in class for students to practice their writing without being interrupted.

There is no point in presenting exotic vocabulary until students have mastered basic, high-frequency words. Learners should be tested on high-frequency word lists for passive knowledge, active production and listening comprehension. Learners cannot comprehend or speak at a high level without these words as a foundation.\n\nLearners need to spend time practicing these words until they are automatic; this is known as building automaticity. Since there is often not enough class time for much word practice, teachers need to present their students with strategies for developing automaticity outside the classroom.</dd>\n\n<dt
