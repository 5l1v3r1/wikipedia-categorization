The quiet game is a children's game where children must stay quiet. Stillness is sometimes a rule but in most cases not.  The last child or team to make noise wins the game. It is usually acceptable for players to make sounds they cannot control, such as sneezing whereas talking would cause a player to get out. The game is often played indoors, typically in classrooms. It can also be played outdoors, for instance, at summer camps. One application of the game is for parents to keep their loud children quiet for a long journey.   It is often used as a social discipline.  There is no writing to others in the silent game because it would count as talking to others. The objective of the game is to get opponents to giggle or talk by any means necessary. This can include but is not limited to making funny faces and gentle tickling. A person cannot make another make noise by inflicting bodily harm. There are many versions of this game, but nonetheless follow the same general rules: one who talks is immediately eliminated (laughing included), eventually isolating the winner at the end. Sometimes it is played with the words in the dictionary instead of all sounds.
