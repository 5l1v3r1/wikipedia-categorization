Action Based Learning Question Types One of the keys to effective Action Learning is asking the "right question". When asked to the right people at the right time, these questions result in obtaining the necessary information.  The Action Learning process, which primarily uses a questioning approach, can be more helpful than offering advice because it assumes that each person has the capacity to find their own answers. Normally, the purpose of asking a question is to obtain information.

For example, some closed questions can only be answered by a “Yes” or “No”. Closed questions should not be interpreted as simple questions. They can be of varying levels of difficulty, and may make the respondent think before answering. Take this phrase for example: "When two quantities are dependent on each other, does an increase in one always leads to an increase in the other?". Usage Of Closed Questions: Open questions allow the respondent to expand or explore in their response, and do not have a single correct response. This gives the respondent the freedom to discover new ideas, consider different possibilities, and decide on the course of action which is right for them.

When asking shorter questions, it is easier to be perceived as abrupt or even rude. When questioning an Action Learning set, it is important to be aware of one's tone and language. The goal is usually to ask challenging questions, or to challenge the respondent's perspective. Usage Of Open Questions:
