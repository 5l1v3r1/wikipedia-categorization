An object lesson is a teaching method that consists of using a physical object or visual aid as a discussion piece for a lesson. The object lesson approach is promoted in the educational philosophy of Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi, who held that teaching should begin with observation of objects which help students recognize concepts.  Object lessons were important elements in teaching during the Victorian era of the mid- to late-nineteenth century.  They are commonly used in religious instruction.
