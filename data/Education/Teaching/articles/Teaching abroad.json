If a person knows that they want to teach abroad but they aren't sure if they're able to make the transition, they can pick a teaching program that goes from a semester to a couple years. There are also programs where one can switch positions with a teacher overseas. When picking a program make sure its a credible program. Three often-used paths for American teachers are teaching at a <a href=\"/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense\" title=\"United States Department of Defense\">Department of Defense</a> school, teaching at an <a href=\"/wiki/International_school\" title=\"International school\">international school</a>, or working independently at any school accepting foreign applicants.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"U.S._Department_of_Defense\">U.S. Department of Defense</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Teaching_abroad&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: U.S. Department of Defense\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Teaching at a U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) school is much like teaching at a school within the United States.  The schools enroll the children of military and DOD civilian employees.  There are currently 222 public schools in \u201c13 foreign countries, seven states, Guam, and Puerto Rico\u201d (DOD).  There are 8,785 teachers working in these schools.  The DOD works to keep the school atmosphere and level of learning comparable to schools within the U.S.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The DOD hires only teachers with bachelor's degrees (which must include some course work in education) and teaching experience.  Most placements are for one or two years; teachers are placed at the discretion of the DoD and cannot choose their location.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"International_volunteer_programs\">International volunteer programs</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Teaching_abroad&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: International volunteer programs\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Numerous volunteer programs exist in which teachers can teach in foreign schools.  Costs to participate as a volunteer vary depending on the organization, the country and the length of the program.  International volunteer programs usually vary in length from 2 to 12 months.  Volunteers most often teach English but other subjects can also be covered, such as computer skills, AIDS/HIV awareness, science, math, etc.\n</p><p>Volunteer English teaching programs exist in almost all corners of the world.  Some countries with prominent English teaching programs are Chile, Spain, France and Georgia.  Many programs are sponsored by the host nation's ministry of education, such as the Chile's <a href=\"/wiki/English_Opens_Doors_Program\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"English Opens Doors Program\">English Opens Doors</a> and Korea's <a href=\"/wiki/EPIK\" title=\"EPIK\">EPIK</a> program.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"International_schools\">International schools</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Teaching_abroad&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: International schools\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/International_school\" title=\"International school\">International schools</a> are private schools that cater mainly to children who are not nationals of the host country, including the children of the staff of international businesses, international organizations, foreign embassies, missions, or missionary programs. Teachers are often hired on contracts which typically last two years <sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> Research has indicated that teaching experiences abroad contribute positively to the intercultural development of teachers (Savva, 2013).\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"TESOL_Certification\">TESOL Certification</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Teaching_abroad&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: TESOL Certification\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Many teaching positions overseas are for teachers of English, and can involve teaching to all ages, including both children and adults.  Programs are organized by individual schools, national governments (such as the <a href=\"/wiki/JET_Programme\" title=\"JET Programme\">JET Programme</a> in Japan and <a href=\"/wiki/English_Opens_Doors_Program\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"English Opens Doors Program\">English Opens Doors</a> in Chile). The University of Missouri-Saint Louis, like many schools, have required their education majors to either pick TESOL or special education to major in for more specificity. This university in particular wants teachers to be more well rounded for future employers. Some programs require <a href=\"/wiki/Teaching_credential\" title=\"Teaching credential\">teaching credentials</a> and/or <a href=\"/wiki/Teaching_English_as_a_foreign_language\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Teaching English as a foreign language\">TESOL certification</a>.\n</p><p>There is some dispute about the claimed usefulness of brief courses (TEFL, TESOL, etc.) in either becoming an effective teacher or finding employment.  Such courses are sometimes advertised as being important or even required, without stating that they are no substitute for a university degree in <a href=\"/wiki/Teaching_English_as_a_foreign_language\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Teaching English as a foreign language\">teaching English as a foreign language</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Teaching_abroad&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/List_of_international_schools\" title=\"List of international schools\">List of international schools</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/International_school\" title=\"International school\">International school</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/International_volunteering\" title=\"International volunteering\">International volunteering</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Teach_Away\" title=\"Teach Away\">Teach Away</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Teaching_abroad&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.dodea.edu\">DoDEA: The Department of Defense Education Activity</a></span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-2\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Savva, M.
