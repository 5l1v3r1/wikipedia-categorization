This is one of the newest methods created by Timothy Hedeen under the cooperative learning techniques used in classroom settings. It follows the same principle as the original Jigsaw method. The jigsaw technique in the cooperative learning methods uses a small group structure to facilitate group discussion through which the learning takes place. The reverse jigsaw method also resembles the original jigsaw method in some way but has its own objectives to be fulfilled. While the jigsaw method focuses on the student’s comprehension of the Instructor’s material, the reverse jigsaw method focuses on the participant’s interpretations such as perceptions, judgements through a very active discussion. This method was mainly created to cater the higher class students. It is best advised to give an explanation before the discussion the topics takes place. This not only ensure that  the learners are more effective in their discussion but also saves time. It differs from the original Jigsaw during the teaching portion of the activity. In the Reverse Jigsaw technique, students in the expert groups teach the whole class rather than return to their home groups to teach the content.  The process involved in the reverse Jigsaw method can be explained in 3 steps This technique could be mainly used in two fashions:  Case study review and Topical Enquiry. The complex questions that are imposed on the students can be in the format: "Why do X?"; "How to do X?"; "Why not do X?", or "In what situations would X not be advised?"; and "Give an example of X." These questions provide useful starting point and bring out the key elements of an effective discussion.
