Faculty development is a similarly used term to staff development and professional development, in settings that pertain to educators.  Professional development for educators may include teacher training, and is usually considered pre-service, or before beginning teaching. However faculty development and professional development may both be used to refer to on-going professional learning for educators. Such learning may take place during work hours, such as "in-service" within K-12 settings, or it may be beyond work hours. These learning pursuits may be for credit or noncredit; therefore they may be with a college or university, through a school district, or private consulting agency. Additionally educators may pursue self-directed learning professional development, although the term faculty development is less commonly applied to this scope of activity. K-12 faculty development and professional development and higher education faculty development and professional development have very different traditions, practices and terminologies.   Higher education faculty development is beginning to take place not just face-to-face but also online.
