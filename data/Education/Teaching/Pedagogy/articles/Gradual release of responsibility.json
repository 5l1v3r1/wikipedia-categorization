Basing their model on the ideas of the Russian <a href=\"/wiki/Educational_theorist\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Educational theorist\">educational theorist</a> Lev <a href=\"/wiki/Vygotsky\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Vygotsky\">Vygotsky</a>, Pearson and Gallagher envisioned instruction that moved from explicit modeling and instruction to guided practice and then to activities that incrementally positioned students into becoming independent learners. The teacher guides the students to a point of '<a href=\"/wiki/Planned_obsolescence\" title=\"Planned obsolescence\">planned obsolescence</a>' on the part of the teacher \"...where the student accepts total responsibility for the task, including the responsibility for determining whether or not she is applying the strategy appropriately (i.e, self monitoring).\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-Pearson_3-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Pearson-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">:<span>34</span></sup>\n</p><p>One element which is crucial to the success of the GRR model is the notion related to '<a href=\"/wiki/Instructional_scaffolding\" title=\"Instructional scaffolding\">instructional scaffolding</a>', which is grounded in Vygotsky's concept of the \"<a href=\"/wiki/Zone_of_proximal_development\" title=\"Zone of proximal development\">zone of proximal development</a>\" (ZPD).  This is described as the distance between the actual developmental level of a learner as determined by their independent <a href=\"/wiki/Problem_solving\" title=\"Problem solving\">problem solving</a> abilities and the level of potential development through problem-solving under adult guidance or in collaboration with more capable peers. That is, the distance between what the children can do without assistance and what they can accomplish with the assistance of more capable peers. The zone of proximal development can be applied as an umbrella over the entire GRR model. Students are given support in the form of scaffolding and differentiate instruction throughout all four phases of the process. Teachers may offer more challenging material to high-achieving students, and assist lower-achieving students in needs-based groups. Teachers will support students as needed throughout all four steps finally allowing for the eventual independence of each student.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> The GRR model \"...assumes that [the student] will need some guidance in reaching that stage of independence and that it is precisely the teacher's role to provide such guidance\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-Pearson_3-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Pearson-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">:<span>34</span></sup>\n</p><p>Vygotsky (1978) believed that guided interactions, with an adult, or a more skilled peer, could facilitate a higher level of thinking within the zone.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> In Vygotsky's theory, this person is referred to as the \"More Knowledgeable Other (MKO)\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> The four phases of the GRR Model are: Focus Lesson \u2013 \"I do it\", Guided Instruction \u2013 \"We do it\", Collaborative \u2013 \"You do it together\", and Independent \u2013 \"You do it alone\" (Fisher &amp; Frey 2006). In the GRR model, the MKO exists in the person of the teacher-guide in the \"I do it\" and \"We do it\" phases. The MKO resurfaces again in the collaborative process where peers may assist each other as expertise, personal experience, and/or understanding allows.\n</p><p>There have been a number of ways of describing and representing the ways in which adults or more experienced others may assist novice learners within their ZPD. Rogoff (1990)<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> recognised that this could be achieved through guided participation, and this is similar to the concept of Tharp and Gallimore's theory (1991),<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> of \"means of assisting\" and to that of the practice of <a href=\"/wiki/Reciprocal_teaching\" title=\"Reciprocal teaching\">reciprocal teaching</a> recognised by Brown and Palincsar.<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> Others have recognised the similarities between this method of instruction and the integrated approach of collaboration in conceptual change (Rochelle, 1992) and the <a href=\"/wiki/Cognitive_apprenticeship\" title=\"Cognitive apprenticeship\">cognitive apprenticeship model</a> of Collins, Brown, and Newman (1989).\n</p><p>This term 'scaffolding' is a useful metaphor that is used to symbolise the process of supporting a learner in the early stages of the learning process \u2013 as the walls get higher \u2013 until there is sufficient evidence of knowledge and skills having been acquired, to then be able to remove that scaffolding so the learner is able to 'stand alone', or be effectively independent enough to continue learning 'alone'. In a similar way, there is a gradual dismantling of the scaffolding as the 'job' becomes more secure and so there is a gradual release of responsibility from the teacher to the learner. As scaffolding is temporary, so too are the lessons that are constructed to help students as they embark into unfamiliar thinking. As noted by Pearson and Gallagher, \"The critical stage of the model is the 'guided practice,' the stage in which the teacher gradually releases task responsibility to the students.\" As such, these lessons eventually fade away as students become gradually more comfortable with the learning and are able to work without the necessary guidance of the teacher.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Pearson_3-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Pearson-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">:<span>35</span></sup>\n</p><p>Although based on the work of <a href=\"/wiki/Jean_Piaget\" title=\"Jean Piaget\">Piaget</a>, the influence of Vygotsky's '<a href=\"/wiki/Constructivist_theory\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Constructivist theory\">constructivist theory</a>' and  learning in the classroom has become more popular because it considers the influence of group processes and social contexts that are, in themselves, influenced by such constructs as <a href=\"/wiki/Cultural_diversity\" title=\"Cultural diversity\">cultural diversity</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Developmental_stage_theories\" title=\"Developmental stage theories\">stages of development</a>.\n</p><p>The GRR model emphasizes instruction that supports and mentors students into becoming capable thinkers and learners when handling tasks with which they have yet to develop expertise in.\nIt is a successful model and has been documented as an effective approach in teaching many subject areas and a variety of content, from writing achievement, <a href=\"/wiki/Reading_comprehension\" title=\"Reading comprehension\">reading comprehension</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Literacy\" title=\"Literacy\">literacy</a> outcomes for <a href=\"/wiki/English_language_learners\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"English language learners\">English language learners</a> (Kong &amp; Pearson, 2003).<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_four_phases\">The four phases</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Gradual_release_of_responsibility&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: The four phases\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Focused_lesson\">Focused lesson</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Gradual_release_of_responsibility&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Focused lesson\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Focus lessons are a time for students to hear the teacher and not answer questions about their own thinking.

Guided instruction gives the teacher an opportunity to <a href=\"/wiki/Differentiated_instruction\" title=\"Differentiated instruction\">differentiated instruction</a> small group instruction, vary the level of prompting and also vary the end product. The teacher must be flexible since the instructional goal of the group may change throughout the sessions.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Fisher_11-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Fisher-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In a classroom there may be many different guided instruction groups. Each group may be working on a different skill or at a different level. Fisher's model recommends meeting with groups 1\u20133 times per week, with some groups meeting more frequently and other stronger groups meeting less often. The size of the groups will also vary depending on how much face time is required for the particular skill. It is a common misconception that guided instruction is only for struggling students. This is an opportunity for teachers to provide enrichment for strong students. Guided instruction is based on the pedagogical principles of scaffolding.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Fisher_11-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Fisher-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>A study by Conklin and Wilkins shows growth and advances in reading levels among elementary students when using a guided reading approach. Working with the teacher in small groups gave students a chance to work on specific skills, at their reading level. Students gained confidence when reading 'just right' texts. Since they were not struggling with the text they were able to develop vocabulary, reading comprehension skills and oral language skills.<sup id=\"cite_ref-14\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup> Gabl, Kaiser, Long and Roemer found similar results when providing reading intervention in the form of guided reading groups to grade two and grade four students.

Gibson notes that providing immediate instructional scaffolding to specific groups of students increases performance. The teacher chooses the instructional goals based on observation and formative assessment.<sup id=\"cite_ref-16\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-16\">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup> Regardless of subject matter, students who are taught and then grouped according to need and re-taught based on their needs commonly show improvement.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Collaborative_learning\">Collaborative learning</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Gradual_release_of_responsibility&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Collaborative learning\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/Collaborative_learning\" title=\"Collaborative learning\">Collaborative learning</a> is the third component of the gradual release of responsibility model where students work in small heterogeneous groups on activities that allow them to deepen their understanding through application of the concept being learned.
