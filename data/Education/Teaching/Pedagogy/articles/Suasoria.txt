Suasoria is an exercise in rhetoric; a form of declamation in which the student makes a speech which is the soliloquy of an historical figure debating how to proceed at a critical junction in their life.  The exercise was used in ancient Rome, where it was, with the controversia, the final stage of a course in rhetoric at an academy.  One famous instance was recalled by Juvenal in the first of his Satires:  Et nos ergo manum ferulæ subduximus: et nos Consilium dedimus Syllæ privatus ut altum Dormiret.  Stulta est clementia cum tot ubique Vatibus occurras perituræ parcere chartæ. I too have felt the master's cane upon my hand.  I too have given Sulla advice to retire into a deep sleep.  No point in sparing paper which is doomed to destruction as you meet all those 'bards' everywhere. Here Juvenal recalls his speech advising the dictator Sulla to retire.  Another Roman poet who recalled enjoying his suasoria was Ovid.
