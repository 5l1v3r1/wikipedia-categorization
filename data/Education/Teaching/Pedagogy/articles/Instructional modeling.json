Students refer to the instructor\u2019s model and attempt to mimic or reproduce what they observed. Repetition of instructor modeling and subsequent student reproduction promotes automaticity of taught skills, procedures and cognition, which improves student performance. \n</p><p>Quite often, instructional modeling is utilized in conjunction with <a href=\"/wiki/Role_playing\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Role playing\">role playing</a>.
