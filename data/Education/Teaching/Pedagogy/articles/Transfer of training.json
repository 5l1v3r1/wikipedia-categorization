Transfer of training is based on the theory of <a href=\"/wiki/Transfer_of_learning\" title=\"Transfer of learning\">transfer of learning</a>.\n</p><p>D H Holding says that \"transfer of training occurs whenever the effects of prior learning influence the performance of a later activity\" (<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://www.amazon.ca/Principles-Training-Commonwealth-International-Psychology/dp/1483127656\">Principles of Training -1965</a>) In  <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/047192248X\"><i>Training for Performance</i></a> Morrison, J. (Ed p.&#160;93 )). The degree to which trainees successfully apply in their jobs  the skills gained in training situations, is considered \"positive transfer of training\" (Baldwin &amp; Ford, 1980).\nAn example of this could be that if a person who is skilled in auto mechanics decides to learn aircraft mechanics, they would find much easier than someone with no previous knowledge of mechanics.\nTransfer of training holds somewhat different meaning in different disciplines of psychology.  Holding's definition reflects a cognitive psychology perspective. A cognitive psychologist might be interested in how the semantic similarity of word pairs in one list affects time to learn on a second list (the transfer task).  From this perspective, the original learning task and the \"later activity\" look very much alike.\n</p><p>Baldwin and Ford's definition reflects an Industrial/Organizational (I/O) Psychology perspective.  An I/O psychologist might be interested in how trainees' motivation to transfer is related to later job performance.  The training domain (e.g., a web-based training program) might be very different from the later \"activity\" domain (e.g. job performance).\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Types\">Types</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Transfer_of_training&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Types\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>There are three types of transfer of training:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Positive Transfer</li></ul>\n<dl><dd>This is when prior learning or training facilitates acquiring a new skill or reaching the solution to a new problem.
