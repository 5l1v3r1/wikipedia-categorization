The Berlin Model (German: Berliner Modell) was developed by Paul Heimann (1901–1967) and is also known as the “Teaching-learning theory of education" (German: lehr-lern-theoretische Didaktik) in order to distinguish it from the "developmental education theory" (German: bildungstheoretische Didaktik) of  Wolfgang Klafki. Heinemann considered Klafki to be thinking in purely ideal terms with his humanistic approach, and instead created a practical model for making education decisions. Heimann’s model is intended to enable teachers to analyze their lessons on a purely empirical and objective basis to make more transparent decisions. It was also intended to assist teachers to consider as many factors as possible in planning their lessons. This would permit specific and scheduled learning. The goal of the “Berlin Model” is to support the process of making useful decisions with regard to the questions “why”, “whereto”, “what” and “how” within a group, considering all the different conditions and situations. It offers support for analysis and planning of single steps and for subsequent reflection and evaluation of work units or group works. By systematic evaluation of teaching on an empirical basis, Heimann established “formal constants” (also known as categories) of lessons, occurring time-independent in teaching. These identified categories (teaching factors) can serve as a guideline to lesson planning. Heimann identifies six of these constants within two fields: The main statements of this model are: The model was advanced to the “Hamburger Modell” in the 1980s by Wolfgang Schulz, a former associate of Heimann. The planning model of Heimann becomes an action model for “emancipatory appreciable and professional pedagogic teaching”. Schulz avoids the strict phenomenological descriptively analysis of teaching and develops a normative model of sceptical teaching which allows pupils to get rid of unnecessary control and act in maximum self-control.
