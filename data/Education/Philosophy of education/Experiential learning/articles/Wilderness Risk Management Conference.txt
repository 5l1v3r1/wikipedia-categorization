The core objective of the Wilderness Risk Management Conference (WRMC) is to offer an outstanding educational experience to help adventure travel and ecotourism companies, clubs, and organizations mitigate the risks inherent in exploring, working, teaching, and recreating in wild places.  The WRMC was founded in 1994 by a collaboration of organizations that had a stake in how risk is managed in outdoor recreation and outdoor education. The founding group consisted of representatives from NOLS, Outward Bound USA, Wilderness Medical Society, Exum Mountain Guides, Association for Experiential Education, National Park Service, National Safety Network, American Alpine Club, and Outdoor Network.   The WRMC covers a variety of topics that fall into a few major categories including: emergency planning and crisis response, field practices, legal considerations, program administration, and staff training and decision making. Additionally, the conference provides structured networking time to meet with other professionals working and managing field programs in the United States, Canada, and internationally. 2016 - Salt Lake City, Utah 2015 - Portland, Oregon  2014 - Atlanta, Georgia 2013 - Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming 2012 - Portland, Oregon 2011 - Boston, Massachusetts 2010 - Colorado Springs, Colorado 2009 - Durham, North Carolina 2008 - Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming 2007 - Banff, Alberta, Canada 2006 - Killington, Vermont Wilderness Risk Management Conference
