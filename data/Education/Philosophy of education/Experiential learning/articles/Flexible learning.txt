Flexible learning is a principle of practice in formal education, concerned with increasing flexibility in the requirements, time and location of  study, teaching, assessment and certification   Flexible learning saw significant development in New Zealand and Australia throughout the late 90s and early 2000s, along with investments in online learning.  It has become synonymous with online learning in recent years, but only because online learning is currently a primary focus of educational institutions, to achieve flexible learning among other things.
