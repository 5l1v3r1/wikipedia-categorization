The Network for Capacity Development in Nutrition is a working group of the United Nations Standing Committee on Nutrition (SCN).  SCN established a set of working groups (WG) on Capacity Development (CD) in close collaboration with United Nations University (UNU).  Reports are available on the Network's website.  The Network had an initial meeting in 2005 and five meetings between 2006 and 2010; its results are published in scientific journals.  SCN formed nine WGs, of which NCDN is one. NCDN CD nutrition includes human resource development, organizational, institutional and legal framework development.CD is a long term, continuing process. It gives primacy to national priorities, plans, policies and processes. Participants came from Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Macedonia, Hungary, Poland, Republika  Srpska, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia and facilitators came from the Netherlands and Norway. The Network links to multiple European Community projects: The general objective of the NCDN Network is to initiate and support CD activities in research and training in Central and Eastern European countries based on country-specific needs. The objectives will be linked to CEE-specific topics of interest. This is to be open for new challenges following the changes in the various countries over time. The European System of Cooperative Research Networks in Agriculture (ESCORENA) was established in 1974 by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization and European research institutions. It became an umbrella for cooperation between research institutions focused on food, agriculture and related fields. Since its foundation, ESCORENA has expanded to include 19 networks, including NCDN CEE. In 2009 with the financial support of FAO REU and FAO technical support, a new server was set up in Rome to serve as common technical background for the AgroWeb Network, ESCORENA and the Thematic Knowledge Networks.
