</noinclude> This WikiProject banner uses {{WPBannerMeta}}, a meta-template for easily creating and maintaining banners and talk-page notices. Please report any such errors or feature requests to Template talk:WPBannerMeta. Any information or warnings about the template are below: This template categorizes pages using assessment grades and importance through built-in transclusion. An article's assessment is generated from the class and importance parameters in the {{WikiProject Homeschooling|class=|importance=}} banner on its talk page. The following values may be used for the class parameter: Articles for which a valid class is not provided are listed in Category:Unassessed homeschooling articles.  The class should be assigned according to the quality scale. The following values may be used for the importance parameter: The parameter is not used if an article's class is set to NA, and may be omitted in those cases. Articles for which a valid importance rating is not provided are listed in Category:Unknown-importance homeschooling articles. The importance should be assigned according to the importance scale. Please note: This template should be transcluded and not substituted (subst), because it employs conditional code. Transclusion also allows easy updating of all the Project's talk pages without having to edit hundreds of pages.
