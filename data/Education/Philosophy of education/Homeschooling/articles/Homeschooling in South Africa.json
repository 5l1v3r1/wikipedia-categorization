This document confirmed that the DBE was indeed willing to attempt to understand home education, because a number of significant paradigms shifts have been made since the previous Discussion Document that was presented in October 2014. In the preparation for the meeting, the agenda was changed a few times.

Three homeschooling individuals were invited to join these meeting. The first meeting was attended by Leendert van Oostrum and Joy Leavesley. Bouwe van der Eems, the third invitee, was unable to travel from Cape Town at short notice. From the start of the first working group meeting, it was made abundantly clear that a different dynamic was at work. During his opening remarks, for example, the chairman (the same Dr Simelane) claimed that \u201c<i>children belong to the state</i>\u201d. He proceeded to make it clear that those present were not there to represent their own stakeholder groups \u2013 they represented no-one except the Department of Basic Education. Very soon, it became obvious that the policy to be written would not represent anything that was presented by homeschool organisations during the consultation sessions. Instead, the discussions were aimed at implementing the original objective of the education minister \u2013 to bring home education in conformance with \u201c<i>the formal education system</i>\u201d. It became apparent to the two homeschoolers present that they were there only so that their names could be listed in the final policy proposal as \u201cmembers of the working group\u201d, giving the impression that homeschoolers were in support of the final proposals. During the second day, Leendert and Joy withdrew as members of the working group, but stated that they remained willing as resources to assist when needed. Only one of the three homeschoolers who had been invited on the working groups had not withdrawn \u2013 Bouwe van der Eems from Cape Town, who did not attend the first work group meeting. He was also unable to travel to Pretoria for the second meeting in November. Karin van Oostrum, another trustee of the Pestalozzi Trust, represented Bouwe at the November meeting. Karin\u2019s impressions of the second meeting were the same as those of the two who had withdrawn during the first meeting. Before the third meeting Karin also withdrew.</li>\n<li><b>Sep - Dec</b>&#160;: In April the children of the Doe (real name withheld) family of KwaZulu-Natal have been removed from their parents by social workers for \u201c<i>not attending school</i>\u201d. The only reasons given to the court were that the children were not attending schools and that their parents were allegedly \"<i>indoctrinating</i>\" the children with their religious beliefs. After this, the Pestalozzi Trust became involved. In December the their three eldest children (of whom the youngest is only three years old) were permanently returned to the care of their parents by the children's court, and set aside all the previous court orders. The court also refused to accept the recommendations of the social worker and other \"<i>interested parties</i>\" that the court orders the social worker to supervise the family's homeschooling for a year. He commented that there is nothing wrong when parents bring up their children in their own beliefs, and that such an upbringing makes the children better people. He also made it very clear that, in his view, these children should never have been before the court in the first place - the matter should have been dealt with by other means.</li></ul>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"2016\">2016</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Homeschooling_in_South_Africa&amp;action=edit&amp;section=23\" title=\"Edit section: 2016\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<ul><li>In <b>March 2016</b> the <u>Global Home Education Conference</u> (GHEC) 2016 took place in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

The Pestalozzi Trust, other associations of home educators and individual home educators only became aware of this in the course of the week-end of the 14th and 15th of October. If a vigilant home educator did not notice this in a press article and alert organisations of home educators, the deadline for comment could easily have passed by without any comment or input from the home education community. The closing date for submissions was 10 November. The most important changes that the bill introduces are the following:\n<ol><li>The content and skills of the curriculum to be used by home learners must be at least comparable to the national curriculum.</li>\n<li>Home learners must be assessed annually by registered assessors.</li>\n<li>Home learners are not allowed to enrol for alternative matric qualifications such as Cambridge and GED.</li>\n<li>The penalty for not registering for home education is increased from 6 months to 6 years.</li></ol></li>\n<li><b>18 Oct</b>&#160;: The Pestalozzi Trust and associations and individual parents requested that the closing date is extended. Reasons for an extension include: home educators have been procedurally prejudiced by lack of prior notice; the prescribed comment period (October\u2013November) is a period of preparation for and taking of exams for home educating families; the need for detailed consultation with members before responding; the impacts of the proposed changes are not merely technical, but may have multiple complex substantive financial, curricular, time, and legal impacts on home educating families and their supporting and representative organisations; the changes do not merely edit elements of the previous law but include entirely new provisions; many consequences thereof that may be unintended by the authors of the proposal bill and if not remedied may lead to unnecessary litigation which is neither in the interests of the Department of Basic Education, home educators nor any other party; homeschool organisations will need to take legal counsel on constitutional and other issues after consulting our members.</li>\n<li><b>10 Nov</b>&#160;: The Pestalozzi Trust and all the homeschool associations submitted their comments on the BELA Bell to the Department of Basic Education (DBE). Parents were also encouraged to send their comments in their own words. A total of about <u>1000 letters from homeschoolers</u> were sent to the DBE. Some of these letters were sent as anonymous submissions to the Pestalozzi Trust. The main objections to the BELA Bill were the following:\n<ol><li>The provision that home learners must register with the state is unreasonable and negatively affects the interests of children. It is untenable that parents, who are primarily responsible for the education of their children, require permission from the state to choose home education.</li>\n<li>The requirement that the proposed home education programme must cover contents and skills comparable to the national curriculum prohibits parents from choosing a curriculum or educational approach that would be in the best interests of the child, and which would not necessarily cover comparable skills and contents.</li>\n<li>The requirement for annual assessments by external assessors serves no educational purpose, covertly enforces the National Curriculum and will be costly to homeschooling parents and the taxpayer.</li>\n<li>The provision to outlaw alternative matric qualifications such as Cambridge and GED would give rise to the creation of a class of persons so disadvantaged that this would be in violation of the fundamental principle of equality which underlies the provisions of the Constitution. Secondly, the requirement that any person wishing to gain the National Senior Certificate should have to follow a three-year programme in order to do so significantly limits the rights of such a person to education.</li>\n<li>The provision to outlaw alternative curriculums and matric qualification would give an unfair financial advantage to CAPS compliant curriculum providers.</li></ol></li></ul>\n<p>To ensure that statements on the negative consequences of the proposed bill can be proven empirically, homeschooling parents were requested to complete a survey. A total of <u>2750 parents completed the survey</u>.\n</p>\n<ul><li><b>17 Nov</b>.&#160;: The Department of Basic Education released a draft policy on home education with 21 days to provide comments.<sup id=\"cite_ref-38\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-38\">&#91;38&#93;</a></sup></li>\n<li><b>22 Nov</b>.&#160;: The Pestalozzi Trust sent a letter to the Department of Basic Education requesting and extension of the closing date for comments to the draft policy on home education. The reasons are similar to the reasons given to request and extension of the BELA Bill.</li>\n<li><b>28 Nov</b>&#160;: Parliament\u2019s oversight education committee has taken the exceptional step of calling a hearing \u2013 before the legislation is even tabled. In their presentation, DBE Director General Mathanzima Mweli said \u2018<i>the word avalanche would not describe</i>\u2019 the submissions they had received <i>\u2018and that he had never seen it in his career in public service</i>\u2019. Democratic Alliance (DA) Shadow Minister of Basic Education Ian Ollis said \u201c<i>the reason you are getting such an avalanche is because you are tampering with the democratic rights of parents with this bill</i>\u201c. Ollis objected to the Director General saying they would be \u201c<i>processing inputs</i>\u201d without saying \u201c<i>they would be considering amendments</i>\u201d. He objected to the Director General\u2019s proposal to hold hearings in which to \u2018<i>educate the public about the bill</i>\u2019, which wrongly assumed they were uninformed and needed education until they agreed. He said they \u201c<i>needed to listen to the public</i>\u201c. The public participation process was also criticized by the ACDP and even ANC members of parliament.  The meeting was extraordinary in a number of respects: First, a bill is normally only discussed in parliament after it is finalised and referred by cabinet. Second, the DBE sent their top officials to the meeting instead of a cabinet meeting discussing on education held at the same time. Third, they deferred to next year another scheduled parliamentary education briefing because after all the questions from parliamentarians, there was no time left for further discussion. Fourth, normally restrained ruling party parliamentarians showed strong independence, asking tough questions and making strong comments. Fifth, because a parliamentary committee requested the education department to extend the time for comment and received agreement. Sixth, strong feelings led the chair to calm the meeting. Seventh, a concerned mom brought her few month old baby, likely the youngest attendee of a parliamentary briefing, much to the delight of female parliamentarians.  At the end of the session, Deputy Minister of Basic Education Enver Surty, granted an extension of time for public comment on the Basic Education Laws Amendment Bill (BELA) till 10 January 2018.</li></ul>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:BELA_Bill_Briefing.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/BELA_Bill_Briefing.jpg/220px-BELA_Bill_Briefing.jpg\" width=\"220\" height=\"165\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/BELA_Bill_Briefing.jpg/330px-BELA_Bill_Briefing.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/BELA_Bill_Briefing.jpg/440px-BELA_Bill_Briefing.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"640\" data-file-height=\"480\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:BELA_Bill_Briefing.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Homeschoolers at briefing on BELA Bill</div></div></div>\n<ul><li><b>5 Dec</b>&#160;: The Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) measured literacy levels between 2011 &amp; 2016 and has found 78% of the Gr. 4 pupils who took part are functionally illiterate and South Africa scored the lowest out of 50 countries globally.</li>\n<li><b>8 Dec</b>&#160;: The Pestalozzi Trust and all the homeschool associations submitted their comments on the Draft Policy on Home Education to the Department of education.

In fact, it could be said that the practical provisions of the Draft Policy are diametrically opposed to the principles on which the Draft Policy is based.</li>\n<li>To further compound this problem, the Draft Policy is based on both the South African Schools Act (No. 84 of 1996) and the BELA Bill.
