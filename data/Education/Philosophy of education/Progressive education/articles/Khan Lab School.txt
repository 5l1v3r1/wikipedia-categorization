Khan Lab School is an independent school in Mountain View, California, associated with Khan Academy.     It is a laboratory school founded by educator Sal Khan.  Khan Lab School allows educators, administrators, and educational technology leaders to tour the school and participate in conversations about the model.  Oxford Day Academy, a charter school in East Palo Alto, California, has publicly credited Khan Lab School with being the inspiration for key components of its model. Oxford Day Academy founder Mallory Dwinal conducted pilot work with students at Khan Lab School.  Charla Harris, founder of Learning by Design Charter School in Los Angeles, has purportedly stated that she will use the Khan Lab School learning space as a model for how she will design the learning space of her elementary school.  After visiting Khan Lab School in 2016, she stated that her school would offer personalized and project-based learning because “there’s not only an achievement gap, but also an innovation gap.”  At the Arizona State University Global Silicon Valley Summit in May 2017, Colleen Broderick of startup company AltSchool drew comparisons between AltSchool and Khan Lab School, referencing the changing role of the educator and the absence of grades and grade bands.  In 2017, Khan Lab School worked with architect Danish Kurani to design and build a high school.  Instead of traditional classrooms, the school has architecturally diverse spaces where faculty test different approaches to learning. Physical and digital displays enable faculty to share their educational experiments with colleagues and visiting educators. A wide range of tools and settings allows students to work according to their preference and learning style.
