Students (known as Fellows in the context of the Entrepreneurship for Good Program) spend 10 weeks on a DO School campus completing a Challenge set by an organization while working through a curriculum built around the DO School Method for creating and implementing innovation. Previous challengers have included, among others, <a href=\"/wiki/Messe_Berlin\" title=\"Messe Berlin\">Messe Berlin</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/H%26M\" title=\"H&amp;M\">H&amp;M Germany</a>. Challenges focus on areas central to good business and innovation, e.g. sustainability, professional development or bottom billion business. By the end of the 10-week period, the Fellows present a solution to the given Challenge that should be ready to implement. In addition, they should have refined their venture idea and business plan. In the following 10 months of the program, Fellows work on setting up their social enterprises in their home countries, with guidance and support from the DO School team. The school currently accepts up to 80 students per year over four different programs.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Innovation_Program\">Innovation Program</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=The_DO_School&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Innovation Program\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The Innovation Program is a three-week, on-campus program which invites aspiring social entrepreneurs to work on an innovation Challenge set by an organization. Using the DO School Method, Challenge participants co-create a concrete, hands-on solution, with or without involvement from the organizations\u2019 employees. Unlike the Entrepreneurship for Good Program, this compact Challenge format does not involve a venture component during which participants work on launching their own start-up.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"DO_Camp\">DO Camp</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=The_DO_School&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: DO Camp\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The DO Camp is an intensive 5-day workshop during which participants learn to use the DO School Method to take them from ideation to implementation.
