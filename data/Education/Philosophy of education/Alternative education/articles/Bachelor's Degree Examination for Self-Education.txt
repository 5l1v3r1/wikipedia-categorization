Bachelor's Degree Examination for Self-Education(BDES, Korean: 독학학위제) makes it possible to obtain a bachelor's degree without attending a regular college or university by passing the examination administered by the government. The Constitution of the Republic of Korea states the government should promote lifelong education. To actualize this, "the Law of Bachelor’s Degree Examination for Self-Education" was established on 7 April 1990. Three major fields(Chinese Language & Literature, Mathematics, and Agriculture) were closed because of the decrease in the number of applicants. But, those who already passed more than a course in the three major fields are still allowed to apply for their further examinations. Childhood education is established only in the 3rd and the final examination and Nursing is established only in the final examination because it needs practicum. There are 4 exams for obtaining a bachelor's degree. Applying each exam needs qualification. For example, a person who is eligible for applying 2nd exam don't need to pass 1st exam. Each exam is once in a year. So it takes a year at least to obtain a bachelor's degree.
