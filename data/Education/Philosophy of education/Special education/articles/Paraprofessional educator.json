In recent years, legislation has been introduced which enables teachers to delegate a range of tasks to their TAs. Teaching Assistants in England and Wales can apply for Higher Level Teaching Assistant (HLTA) status, which requires them to document the ways in which their work meets a set of specified criteria. Those with HLTA status can substitute for teachers and (where appropriate) supervise other TAs. Scotland uses the term \"classroom assistant\" rather than \"teaching assistant\" as teaching is strictly not part of an assistant's responsibilities there.\n</p><p>In Canada, they are widely known as Educational Assistants to emphasize their role in educating special needs students.\n</p><p>In Japan, foreign native speakers employed as paraprofessional language educators (primarily English) are known as <a href=\"/wiki/Assistant_Language_Teacher\" title=\"Assistant Language Teacher\">Assistant Language Teachers</a>.

This links the paraprofessional to the students, but not the teacher or schools itself.  \n</p><p>The role of the paraprofessional educator is constantly evolving.
