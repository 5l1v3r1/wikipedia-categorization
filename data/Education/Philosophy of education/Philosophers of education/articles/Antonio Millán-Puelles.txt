Antonio Millán-Puelles (February 11, 1921 – March 22, 2005) was a Spanish philosopher interested in phenomenology and metaphysics, who published many books and articles. He discovered his vocation to philosophy when he read Husserl’s Logical Investigations and abandoned the medical studies he had just begun. His preferred topics were the relationship between conscience and subjectivity, the value of freedom, the ideal and the unreal being, and the rapport between metaphysics and logic. "The properly and refreshing philosophical attitude of the author is precisely made evident by the fact that he is open to the truth regardless of who stayed it. He is close to the phenomena and data of experience and analyzes them carefully and without a trace of reductionism and constructivism".  Among his most important books there are: His books could be divided in three main groups: those devoted to the theory of knowledge and metaphysics, those devoted to ethics and society, and educational handbooks. In all these works he studies and comments Brentano, Aristotle, Aquinas, Husserl, Kant, Hartmann, Meinong, Sartre, Heidegger, and many other ancient, medieval, and modern philosophers.
