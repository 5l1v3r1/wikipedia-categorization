SCAMPER is an acronym that provides a structured way of assisting students to think out of the box and enhance their knowledge.  It is thought to protect students' creativity as they mature.  SCAMPER was proposed by Alex Faickney Osborn in 1953, and was further developed by Bob Eberle in 1971 in his book; SCAMPER:  Games for Imagination Development.  SCAMPER is an activity based thinking process that can be performed by Cooperative learning. Here the teacher assists the students in choosing a particular topic and helps them to develop it through a structured process. After choosing an idea, the students are given a tale where they perform the activity in steps corresponding to the letters in the name. Hence, SCAMPER as a teaching strategy helps the students to analyse the knowledge in its creative form and helps the teacher to make teaching creative and interesting. SCAMPER also provides a ‘hip-pocket’ tool; i.e., an unplanned method of developing questions on an impromptu basis designed to challenge meeting participants' creativity and to make their thinking visible.
