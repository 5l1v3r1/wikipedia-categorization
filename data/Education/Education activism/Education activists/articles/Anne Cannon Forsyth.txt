Stauffer Foundation largely helped integrate the Virginia Episcopal School in 1967, Bill Alexander and Marvin Barnard were among the first two to attend.  Forsyth rationalized starting the program because of the benefits she believed both black and white students would acquire.

Anne Cannon Forsyth was the daughter of Zachary Smith Reynolds and Anne Cannon Stauffer.  Forysth had a tumultuous childhood after the divorce of her parents and the early death of her father.  Forsyth has two sons, Zachary Tate and Jock Tate, both involved in the Z. Smith Reynolds Foundation.
