An organization that provides programs and services for students, parents and educators. She is quoted as saying why she founded (BEPAA);  “There was a Jewish Board, a Catholic Board, all these Boards—yet nothing to represent and stand for us. It had to be done.”   In 2006, over 1000 community leaders, educators, and residents in Central Brooklyn came together for a Black Brooklyn Empowerment Convention. The convention was held to address community issues related to education, employment, health, housing, and quality of life issues in Central Brooklyn. School and education disparities were a core concern at the convent. A recommendation to formulate a organization around this concern grew out of the convent with the creation of the Adelaide Sanford Institute to honor Adelaide Sanford. In 2012 the Adelaide L. Sanford Institute (ASI) started having community round table discussions in Central Brooklyn. The round table discussions were started to provide community based organizations, elected officials, parents, clergy, community leaders a forum for discussions and strategies around State Standards in New York City public schools.   I try to get children to internalize discipline, so we don't have to tell them what not to do."   “We took every White image off the walls [at PS 21]. George Washington, Abraham Lincoln and more,” reflected Dr. Sanford. “Those people made war, and we were teaching our children not to fight. We had to have images on our walls of peacemakers.”   “I wear beads and bangles in my hair to represent the okra seeds and yam tubers our ancestors kept in theirs as they traveled here from home,” she said gently but powerfully. “We must pass on these things to the next generation, and always give them something to hold onto.”  Adelaide SanfordDr. Adelaide Sanford and the Story of John Hernrik Clarke House  Dr. Adelaide Sanford - The Great Harlem Debate - December 14, 2008
