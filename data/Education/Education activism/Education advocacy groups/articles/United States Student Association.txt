The United States Student Association (USSA) was founded in 1947 and bills itself as the oldest, largest, and most inclusive student association in the United States.  USSA was formed by a merger of the National Student Association (NSA) and the National Student Lobby (NSL); and it later absorbed the National Student Educational Fund (NSEF). Its political activism was cited in a 1995 lawsuit concerning the University of Wisconsin's mandatory student fee. In Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System v. Southworth 529 U.S. 217 (1999), the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the university's right to subsidize political speech with student fees. Regions: Affiliations and coalitions: The USSA annually elects a President and Vice President at its National Student Congress to manage the organization full-time. The current President is Joseline Garcia, and the current Vice President is Chris Gannon.
