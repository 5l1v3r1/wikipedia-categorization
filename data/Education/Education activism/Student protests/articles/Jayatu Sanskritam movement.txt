The Jayatu Sanskritam movement was begun in July 1947 by students of the Tindhara School in Nepal. They demanded democracy and the inclusion of modern subjects in their curriculum. It was the first student uprising in Nepal's history.   The students of tindhara pakshala (hostel) was also not unaffected by the anti-rana movements in Nepal. The hostel was so called because it had three taps. There were the students of Rajkiya Sanskrit Vidyalaya situated nearby the Ranipokhari. On 1 Asar, 2004 the students summited a demand paper to P.M Padma Shumsher requesting to introduce courses in geography, history,economics and political science too.  But the P.M paid no attention to their demand as a result they went on a strike. This is the info we have got from historian "Kalyan Krishna Timsina"
