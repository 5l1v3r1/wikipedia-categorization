class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Soon after the passing of the Fundamental Law, there were numerous arguments suggesting its revision.  Some suggested that ideas of <a href=\"/wiki/Patriotism\" title=\"Patriotism\">patriotism</a> and regard for Japanese traditions were lacking, and others maintained that such provisions could lead to renewed feelings of nationalism and subservience to the state.  Such arguments have been brought up repeatedly since the law was first passed.\n</p><p>On April 28, 2006, the Cabinet drafted a reformed version of the law which was submitted to the 164th ordinary session of the <a href=\"/wiki/National_Diet\" title=\"National Diet\">National Diet</a> (sitting from January to June 2006).  The draft is composed of a preamble and 18 articles.  The new preamble does not include the phrase \"the realization of the ideals laid forth in the constitution depend on the education of the people\", as is stated in the current law, and includes some additions, such as the phrases \"community spirit\" and \"the inheritance of tradition\".  In addition, the \"purpose of education\" has been divided into five items, containing such moral provisions as \"to nurture an attitude[...]to love our country and our home\".\n</p><p>On May 2, 2006, the Ministry of Education announced that they had established a \"Fundamental Law of Education Reform Promotion Headquarters\" under the direction of <a href=\"/wiki/Kenji_Kosaka\" title=\"Kenji Kosaka\">Kenji Kosaka</a>, the Minister of Education.  The first meeting was scheduled for May 8, and a project team was established.  The objective of this group is not only to regulate argument in the Diet, but also to assist in initiatives to explain the educational reforms to the public and decide on basic programs promoting education.\n</p><p>On December 22, 2006 the complete revision of the Fundamental Law of Education passed and was implemented. It now contains 18 Articles.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Main_points_of_contention\">Main points of contention</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Fundamental_Law_of_Education&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Main points of contention\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Opinion was divided on whether students should receive education \"according to individual ability\" or \"equally\". The new Law does not contain the word \"equally\" any longer.\n</p><p>There was also debate about whether the absolution of school fees at public universities should be limited only to tuition costs, or should also include textbook fees, food costs, commutation costs, etc.\n</p><p>There was debate concerning the topic of political neutrality, namely, what kind of political education should be forbidden, and how to harmonize this with the promotion of political interest amongst students. In 1954, the Japanese government, aiming to curb political activity by the <a href=\"/wiki/Japan_Teachers_Union\" title=\"Japan Teachers Union\">Japan Teachers Union</a>, passed a law designed to ensure \"political neutrality\" in Japanese public schools. In 2004, Prime Minister <a href=\"/wiki/Junichiro_Koizumi\" title=\"Junichiro Koizumi\">Junichiro Koizumi</a> refused to accept a petition\u2014written by Japanese high school students\u2014against the deployment of the <a href=\"/wiki/Japan_Self-Defense_Forces\" title=\"Japan Self-Defense Forces\">Japan Self-Defense Forces</a> to <a href=\"/wiki/Iraq\" title=\"Iraq\">Iraq</a>\n, said to be due to the prohibition on political education.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Political_Debate\">Political Debate</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Fundamental_Law_of_Education&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Political Debate\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>On March 20, 2003, based on the discussions of the People's Educational Reform Council (a consultative body to the Prime Minister dissolved in Dec. 2000), the Central Education Council reported to Minister of Education <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Atsuko_Toyama&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Atsuko Toyama (page does not exist)\">Atsuko Toyama</a> on the necessity of reform to the Fundamental Law.\n</p><p>According to the report, the concepts expressed in the Fundamental Law should continue to be valued; however, in order to meet the challenges of the 21st century, the following reforms would be necessary.\n</p>\n<ol><li>the establishment of a trustworthy schooling system</li>\n<li>promotion of university reform, to become leaders in the information age</li>\n<li>to restore the educational ability of the family, and to promote a society in which the school, family, and local community cooperate</li>\n<li>to foster attitudes to take part in community planning</li>\n<li>to foster respect for Japanese traditions and culture, to encourage love for the homeland, and promote the spirit of membership in the international community</li>\n<li>the realization of a society based on lifelong learning</li>\n<li>to decide on a master plan to encourage education</li></ol>\n<p>In April 2004, the ruling <a href=\"/wiki/Liberal_Democratic_Party_(Japan)\" title=\"Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)\">Liberal Democratic</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/New_Clean_Government_Party\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"New Clean Government Party\">Komei</a> Parties reached an agreement on the meaning of the term \"patriotism\" (\"to value customs and culture, and to love our country, from which they have developed\") and submitted a reform proposal to the Diet, the first such proposal to be submitted to the Diet since the end of World War II.\n</p><p>The proposed reforms reflect three influential lines of thinking.\n</p>\n<ol><li>Educational reform is necessary to nurture an educational elite and in order for Japan to continue to be a leader in developing cutting-edge technology.</li>\n<li>Problem children responsible for the disintegration of Japanese society (including such problems as youth crime, bullying and truancy) can be dealt with through home discipline, the strengthening of moral education, and community service.</li>\n<li>The expansion of the Ministry of Education's realm of authority is critical.
