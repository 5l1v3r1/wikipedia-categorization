The University Act was enacted by the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia to establish one degree-granting universities for British Columbia. The first University Act was passed in 1890, which act continues in force and defines the first Convocation of The University of British Columbia. A subsequent Act was passed in 1908 (in conjunction with the University Endowment Act of 1907). Under this new statute, the governance of the University of British Columbia was clarified.
