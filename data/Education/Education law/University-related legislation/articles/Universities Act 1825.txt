The Universities Act 1825 (Ch 97 6 Geo 4, long name An Act for the better Preservation of the Peace and good Order in the Universities of England) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom which provides for officers of police constable status within Cambridge and Oxford Universities. Sections 3 and 4 have been repealed.  In 2003 the University of Oxford closed its police force to avoid the complexity and costs of complying with new standards.

Jurisdiction was within the precincts and four miles outside of the relevant universities.   Provides for a pro vice chancellor, or deputy vice chancellor to create constables in the absence of the chancellor.   Provided for the apprehension of prostitutes within the precincts of the university. This was repealed by Statute Law (Repeals) Act 1989 (c. 43), s. 1(1), Sch. 1 Part I.  Defined the act as a Public Act. This was repealed by Statute Law Revision (No. 2) Act 1888 (c. 57).
