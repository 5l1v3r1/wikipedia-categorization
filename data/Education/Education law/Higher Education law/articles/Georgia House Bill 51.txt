House Bill 51 (full title: Postsecondary institutions; reporting and investigation of certain crimes by officials and employees; provide manner) is a bill introduced into the Georgia House of Representatives which would limit the ability of college campuses in Georgia to investigate alleged sex crimes committed on campus.  For example, it would effectively sidestep the common university practice of holding so-called "Title IX hearings" to decide whether to discipline a student accused of sexual assault.  Instead, the bill would require some university employees to report possible felonies to law enforcement. The bill was introduced by Representative Earl Ehrhart (R-Powder Springs) on January 11, 2017,  and was passed by the House of Representatives on March 1, 2017, in a 115-55 vote.  On March 24, the Georgia State Senate Judiciary Committee tabled the bill,  On March 28, Ehrhart replaced a part of Senate Bill 71 that pertained to health savings accounts with language from House Bill 51 in an effort to get it passed.  Nevertheless, this bill, like HB51, failed to receive final approval before the state legislature ended its work for the year. However, it can still be considered for passage in next year's session.
