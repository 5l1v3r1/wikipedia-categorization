A college is required to be affiliated in order to exist and maintain standards and norms set by the university. The autonomy of the college is thereby impaired.</li>\n<li>It mandates a territorial jurisdiction of universities, thereby denying colleges to make a free choice as to which university they want to affiliate to.</li>\n<li>Independent senates of several universities were abolished. The new structure consists of positions of power held  by state government officials, and those nominated directly or indirectly by government ministries or politicians.</li>\n<li>Authorities having more influence and power have more appointed officers and less academicians.</li>\n<li>The act specifies seniority (number of years of employment) as a means of selecting professors rather than alternative means of evaluation.</li>\n<li>It prohibits those appointed to teach, to conduct private tuitions. Financing and Labour issues prevent the university or affiliated colleges from hiring the best available lecturer with higher remuneration. Prohibiting private tuitions only treated the issue symptomatically than by addressing the cause of decreasing quality.</li>\n<li>Research is considered to be the same as teaching in the sense of extended study. No administrative provisions exist to facilitate the research impact of a university, like laboratories, research centers, PhD student enrollment, graduate student enrollment, tenure process of a professor, research grants to professors.</li></ul>\n<p><b>Politically (legislature) appointed officials within the syndicate</b>\n</p><p>Since the university is maintained and funded by the state government it is expected that officials of the state government executive manage the administrative affairs.

However, the law makes it possible for the ruling state government legislature to also make appointments and thereby have political control.\n</p>\n<ul><li>Six persons are nominated by the State Government legislature.</li></ul>\n<p>The others include two members nominated by the Chancellor, commissioner for collegiate education, director of technical education, one dean, two chancellor nominees, four principals. \n</p><p>The position of Pro-Chancellor is the current minister in charge of higher education of the legislature, and can act on behalf of the Chancellor if the Chancellor is absent.\n</p><p><b>Non-academic government (executive and legislature) appointed officials within the academic council</b>\n</p>\n<ol><li>Commissioner for collegiate education or his nominee</li>\n<li>Director of technical education or his nominee</li>\n<li>One member of the Karnataka Legislative Assembly</li>\n<li>Two members of the Karnataka Legislative Council</li>\n<li>Three eminent persons representing industry nominated by the state government</li></ol>\n<p>The others include five professors, five deans and six students.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Karnataka_State_Universities_Act,_2000&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://dpal.kar.nic.in/STATE%20UNIVERSITY%20ACT-B%20(VIII)%20(BM).pdf\">THE KARNATAKA STATE UNIVERSITIES ACT, 2000</a></span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-2\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Tumkur University, 1st Floor, Dr B R Ambedkar Bhavan, M G Road Tumkur - 572 101, Karnataka</span>\n</li>\n</ol></div>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw2241\nCached time: 20180913040841\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.016 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.017 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 47/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 0/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 760/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:9000398-0!canonical and timestamp 20180913040841 and revision id 771148344\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"Mysore","*":"Universities_in_Karnataka"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Karnataka_state_legislation"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Education_law_in_India"},{"sortkey":"","*":"2000_in_India"},{"sortkey":"","*":"2000_in_law"},{"sortkey":"","*":"2000_in_education"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"India"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Karnataka"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Monitoring and Evaluation"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Ordinance (university)"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Statutes"}],"templates":[],"images":[],"externallinks":["http://dpal.kar.nic.in/STATE%20UNIVERSITY%20ACT-B%20(VIII)%20(BM).pdf"],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Description","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Karnataka_State_Universities_Act,_2000","byteoffset":314,"anchor":"Description"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Amendments","number":"2","index":"2","fromtitle":"Karnataka_State_Universities_Act,_2000","byteoffset":658,"anchor":"Amendments"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Structure","number":"3","index":"3","fromtitle":"Karnataka_State_Universities_Act,_2000","byteoffset":1398,"anchor":"Structure"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Merits","number":"4","index":"4","fromtitle":"Karnataka_State_Universities_Act,_2000","byteoffset":2252,"anchor":"Merits"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Criticisms","number":"5","index":"5","fromtitle":"Karnataka_State_Universities_Act,_2000","byteoffset":2743,"anchor":"Criticisms"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"References","number":"6","index":"6","fromtitle":"Karnataka_State_Universities_Act,_2000","byteoffset":5663,"anchor":"References"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Karnataka State Universities Act, 2000","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q6372915"}]}}
