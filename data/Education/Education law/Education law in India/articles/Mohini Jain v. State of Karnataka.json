The Government of Karnataka issued a notification dated 5 June 1989 under section 5(1) of the Karnataka Educational Institutions (Prohibition of capitation fee) Act, 1984, which fixed the tuition and other fees to be charged from the students by the private medical colleges in the state.

According to the third respondent, the private medical college, those students who were admitted under \"Government seat quota\" were meritorious and those who were admitted under the \"Management quota\" (other than \"Government seat\") were not meritorious; the classification was valid and hence, in such situation, the college-management had the right to charge more fee from non-meritorious students to meet the expenses in order to provide <a href=\"/wiki/Medical_education\" title=\"Medical education\">medical education</a> to the students.<sup id=\"cite_ref-scoi_2-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-scoi-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>According to the intervener, Karnataka Private Medical Colleges Association, the private medical colleges in the state of Karnataka received no financial aid either from the State or Central Government. The expenditure per student for 5-year MBBS course in private medical colleges was about 5 lakhs and forty percent of the seats were filled by the \"Government Quota\" under which students paid only Rs. 2,000/- per year, therefore, students admitted under \"Management quota\" had to share the burden.

An individual cannot be assured <a href=\"/wiki/Human_dignity\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Human dignity\">human dignity</a> unless his/her personality is developed and the only way to do that is to educate the individual. When the Constitution was framed (the Constitution was adopted in 1950), 70 percent of the citizens of the country were <a href=\"/wiki/Illiterate\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Illiterate\">illiterate</a>. The framers of the constitution hoped to achieve 100 percent <a href=\"/wiki/Literacy\" title=\"Literacy\">literacy</a> within a time period of 10 years. Guided by this hope, Article 41 (\"The State shall, within the limits of its economic capacity and development, make effective provision for securing the right to work, to education and to public assistance in cases of unemployment, old age, sickness and disablement, and in other cases of underserved want\") and Article 45 (\"The State shall endeavour to provide, within a period of ten years from the commencement of this Constitution, for free and <a href=\"/wiki/Compulsory_education\" title=\"Compulsory education\">compulsory education</a> for all children until they complete the age of fourteen years\") were included in the Chapter IV of the constitution.<sup id=\"cite_ref-scoi_2-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-scoi-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The court referred to the various provisions in the Constitution of India and reminded that the 'Preamble' has promised to secure to all citizens of India \"Justice, social, economic and political\", \"Liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith, and worship\". It further provided \"Equality of status and of opportunity\" and assured dignity of the individual. The objectives flowing from the 'Preamble' cannot be achieved and shall remain on paper unless the people in this country were educated.<sup id=\"cite_ref-scoi_2-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-scoi-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The Court said that although 'right to education' had not been guaranteed as a <a href=\"/wiki/Fundamental_rights\" title=\"Fundamental rights\">fundamental right</a> under Part III of the constitution, the Articles 21 (in Part III of the Constitution of India), Article 38, 39(a), (f), 41 and 45 (in Part IV of the Constitution of India) together makes it clear that the framers of the constitution made it obligatory for the State to provide education for its citizens. Article 21 says \"No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law\". The <a href=\"/wiki/Right_to_life\" title=\"Right to life\">right to life</a> under Article 21 and the dignity of an individual cannot be assured unless it is accompanied by right to education. Therefore, every citizen had a 'right to education' under the constitution and thus, the state had an obligation to provide <a href=\"/wiki/Educational_institution\" title=\"Educational institution\">educational institutions</a> at all levels for the benefit of all the citizens. All educational institutions whether it was state owned or state recognized were obliged to secure the 'right to education'.<sup id=\"cite_ref-scoi_2-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-scoi-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In Part IV, the directive principles of the state policy, the Constitution asks the State to secure <a href=\"/wiki/Social_order\" title=\"Social order\">social order</a> and minimize inequalities for the promotion of welfare of citizens (Article 38). Article 39 of Part IV talks about directing the state policies to secure adequate means of livelihood of citizen and offer opportunities to children to facilitate their healthy al-round development. Reality of the fundamental rights under chapter III will not be realized by illiterate citizens unless \"right to education\" under Article 41 was ensured to the individual citizen. Therefore, \"right to education\" was concomitant to the fundamental rights provided under Part III of the constitution.<sup id=\"cite_ref-scoi_2-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-scoi-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The fundamental rights guaranteed under Part III of the constitution of India including the right to <a href=\"/wiki/Freedom_of_speech\" title=\"Freedom of speech\">freedom of speech</a> and expression and other rights under Article 19 cannot be appreciated and fully enjoyed unless a citizen is educated and is conscious of his individual dignity. Education is instrumental to reduce the <a href=\"/wiki/Social_inequality\" title=\"Social inequality\">inequality</a>, and ensuring adequate livelihood. Illiterate people is vulnerable to <a href=\"/wiki/Exploitation_of_labour\" title=\"Exploitation of labour\">exploitation</a>. Without education the vision expressed in the said articles of the Constitution can not be realized. The court said that the 'Directive Principles', which were fundamental in the governance of the country, cannot be isolated from the fundamental rights guaranteed under Part III. They were supplementary to each other and have to be read into the fundamental rights.<sup id=\"cite_ref-scoi_2-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-scoi-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Court.27s_responses_on_charging_capitation_fee\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Court's_responses_on_charging_capitation_fee\">Court's responses on charging capitation fee</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Mohini_Jain_v._State_of_Karnataka&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Court&#039;s responses on charging capitation fee\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Charging capitation fee limits the access to the education only to the richer section of the people. Poorer person with better merit can not get admission due to inability to pay money and as a consequence in educational institution a citizen's 'right to education' gets denied. Further, allowing charging capitation fee violates Article 14 of the constitution of India. The only method of admission to the medical colleges should be by <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/merit\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikt:merit\">merit</a> and merit alone. The court further stated that the capitation fee was simply a price for selling education. The concept of \"teaching shops\" was not at par with the constitutional scheme and was entirely opposing character to the Indian culture and heritage.<sup id=\"cite_ref-scoi_2-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-scoi-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Court made one significant remark in stating that if government recognises or approve a professional institution to run a professional course, it is State responsibility to ensure that the Institute should charge the government rates only and right to education is preserved.<sup id=\"cite_ref-scoi_2-14\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-scoi-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Significance_of_the_Case\">Significance of the Case</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Mohini_Jain_v._State_of_Karnataka&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Significance of the Case\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The judgment is historic in its own accord.

The decision of the Court that the fulfillment of the right to life requires a life of dignity and therefore, must be interpreted to include both the economic and social rights. Education is as basic as to ensure rights to food, water, and health. But, question arise whether right to education at all level is essential for citizens for living a descent life? Whether right to education should be limited to only right to primary and basic education?
