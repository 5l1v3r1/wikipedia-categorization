The most famous by far is the law of 1647, also known as the <b>Old Deluder Satan Law</b> (after the law's first sentence) and <b>The General School Law of 1642</b>. These laws are commonly regarded as the historical first step toward compulsory government-directed <a href=\"/wiki/Public_education\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Public education\">public education</a> in the <a href=\"/wiki/United_States_of_America\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"United States of America\">United States of America</a>.

The first Massachusetts School Law of 1642 broke with English tradition by transferring educational supervision from the clergy to the <a href=\"/wiki/Selectmen\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Selectmen\">selectmen</a> of the colony, empowering them to assess the education of children \"to read &amp; understand the principles of religion and the capital laws of this country.\" It held parents and masters responsible for their children's and apprentices' ability to read and write, stressing education rather than schooling. However, its implementation appears to have been somewhat neglected. Probably in response to this, the 1647 law was enacted by the <a href=\"/wiki/Massachusetts_General_Court\" title=\"Massachusetts General Court\">Massachusetts General Court</a> to impel the towns of the colony to found, operate and fund schools.<sup id=\"cite_ref-eberling_1-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-eberling-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Framing_and_provisions_of_the_Acts\">Framing and provisions of the Acts</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Massachusetts_School_Laws&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Framing and provisions of the Acts\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The 1647 legislation specifically framed ignorance as a <a href=\"/wiki/Satan\" title=\"Satan\">Satanic</a> ill to be circumvented through the education of the country's young people. It required every town having more than 50 families to hire a teacher, and every town of more than 100 families to establish a \"grammar school\". Failure to comply with the mandate would result in a fine of \u00a35. The grammar school clause was intended to prepare students to attend <a href=\"/wiki/Harvard_College\" title=\"Harvard College\">Harvard College</a>, whose mission was to prepare young men for the ministry.\n</p><p>The rationale for the law reflected the <a href=\"/wiki/Calvinism\" title=\"Calvinism\">Calvinist</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Puritan\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Puritan\">Puritan</a> ethos of the time and in particular the influence of the Reverend <a href=\"/wiki/John_Cotton_(puritan)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"John Cotton (puritan)\">John Cotton</a>, who was a teacher in the <a href=\"/wiki/First_Church_of_Boston\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"First Church of Boston\">First Church of Boston</a> and one of the Massachusetts Bay Colony's most influential leaders. The Puritans sought to create a literate population to ensure that, as the law put it, \"<a href=\"/wiki/Thorn_(letter)\" title=\"Thorn (letter)\">ye</a> ould deluder, Satan\" could not use illiteracy to \"keepe men from the knowledge of ye <a href=\"/wiki/Scriptures\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Scriptures\">Scriptures</a>.\" <sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> Their religious beliefs emphasized the view that personal knowledge of the Scriptures was an essential requirement for temporal living and eternal salvation.<sup id=\"cite_ref-eberling_1-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-eberling-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> The statute also endorsed the principle that the interpretation of the Scriptures should be done under the aegis of proper authority, namely the Puritan leaders, in order to avoid \"false glosses of saint seeming deceivers\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>A further piece of educational legislation was passed in 1648, addressing and extending the schooling requirements set out in the 1642 law. It stipulated that children and apprentices, under the authority of parents or masters, were to be taught reading, the public laws, the <a href=\"/wiki/Catechism\" title=\"Catechism\">catechism</a> and \"some honest lawful calling, labour or employment.\" Selectmen were to act as supervisors of the population, conducting examinations and if necessary fining parents or placing the young with other masters if their education was neglected.<sup id=\"cite_ref-eberling_1-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-eberling-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The practical implementation of the educational laws appears to have been distinctly inconsistent. By the end of the 1650s, all eight of the 100-family towns and a third of the 50-family towns had met the respective requirements for grammar schools and the hiring of teachers. However, the remainder of the towns and many new towns ignored both mandates and instead paid the fine. The <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Massachusetts_Evil_Code&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Massachusetts Evil Code (page does not exist)\">Massachusetts Evil Code</a> of 1660 reiterated the school laws, but still met with a lack of implementation; to enforce it, a fresh act was passed in 1668.<sup id=\"cite_ref-eberling_1-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-eberling-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Text_of_the_Massachusetts_School_Law_of_1642\">Text of the Massachusetts School Law of 1642</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Massachusetts_School_Laws&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Text of the Massachusetts School Law of 1642\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<blockquote><p>Forasmuch as the good education of children is of singular behoof and benefit to any Common-wealth; and whereas many parents &amp; masters are too indulgent and negligent of their duty in that kind.
