Kuhlmeier\">Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier</a> (1988) Supreme Court ruling, which limited the <a href=\"/wiki/Freedom_of_speech\" title=\"Freedom of speech\">freedom of speech</a> granted to public <a href=\"/wiki/School_newspaper\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"School newspaper\">high school newspapers</a>. The Hazelwood v.

Ed Code 48907 affirms the right of high school newspapers to publish whatever they choose, so long as the content is not explicitly obscene, libelous, or slanderous.

As a recent Legal News Advisory issued by the <a href=\"/wiki/California_Department_of_Education\" title=\"California Department of Education\">California Department of Education</a> noted, these newspapers exist mainly to teach students the elements of journalism and to supplement the language arts curriculum. However, the same advisory also noted that students have a legitimate interest in the full expression of their own ideas on topics of concern, even when those ideas are in conflict with or are critical of those of the school or the majority of the public. Following the landmark Supreme Court ruling in Tinker v. Des Moines, which asserted that students do not lose their free speech protections in school, students are allowed a degree of freedom of expression in school, even if these rights are justifiably less than those experienced out of the classroom.\n</p><p>However, the 1974 study commissioned by the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial, <i>Captive Voices</i>, found that <a href=\"/wiki/Censorship\" title=\"Censorship\">censorship</a> and the systematic lack of freedom to engage in open, responsible journalism characterize high school journalism. This study, which examined censorship issues, minority participation and journalism education, and the commercial media's involvement with scholastic journalism, also found that censorship of journalism is a matter of policy in all areas of the country despite legal protections that override such censorship. Importantly, the issue of <a href=\"/wiki/Self-censorship\" title=\"Self-censorship\">self-censorship</a> was found to have created passivity among students and made them cynical about the guarantees of a free press under the First Amendment.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>As a counter to these suppressions and as a reaction to Tinker v. Des Moines, California became the first state in the United States to enact a statutory scheme that protected the free speech rights of students. These protections were codified in Educational Code 10611.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> In 1977, the California Legislature rewrote this code and replaced it with Educational Code 48907. This revision was prompted by Bright v. Los Angeles Unified School District (1976), in which the <a href=\"/wiki/California_Supreme_Court\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"California Supreme Court\">California Supreme Court</a> found that Educational Code 10611 did not authorize <a href=\"/wiki/Prior_restraint\" title=\"Prior restraint\">prior restraint</a>, and thus that a school could only discipline a student for violation of a publications rule or prohibit further distribution. However, Educational Code 10611 was not completely clear, and thus the Legislature replaced it with the current statute, 48907, which now states that prior restraint is allowed only when student expression violates the specific prohibitions of Section 48907.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Text\">Text</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=California_Education_Code_48907&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Text\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The main text of the Code is as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Students of the public schools including charter schools, shall have the right to\nexercise freedom of speech and of the press including, but not\nlimited to, the use of bulletin boards, the distribution of printed\nmaterials or petitions, the wearing of buttons, badges, and other\ninsignia, and the right of expression in official publications,\nwhether or not such publications or other means of expression are\nsupported financially by the school or by use of school facilities,\nexcept that expression shall be prohibited which is obscene,\nlibelous, or slanderous.  Also prohibited shall be material which so\nincites students as to create a clear and present danger of the\ncommission of unlawful acts on school premises or the violation of\nlawful school regulations, or the substantial disruption of the\norderly operation of the school.\n<br /><br />\nEach governing board of a school district and each county board of\neducation shall adopt rules and regulations in the form of a written\npublications code, which shall include reasonable provisions for the\ntime, place, and manner of conducting such activities within its\nrespective jurisdiction.\n<br /><br />\nStudent editors of official school publications shall be\nresponsible for assigning and editing the news, editorial, and\nfeature content of their publications subject to the limitations of\nthis section.  However, it shall be the responsibility of a\njournalism adviser or advisers of student publications within each\nschool to supervise the production of the student staff, to maintain\nprofessional standards of English and journalism, and to maintain the\nprovisions of this section.\n<br /><br />\nThere shall be no prior restraint of material prepared for\nofficial school publications except insofar as it violates this\nsection.  School officials shall have the burden of showing\njustification without undue delay prior to any limitation of student\nexpression under this section.\n<br /><br />\n\"Official school publications\" refers to material produced by\nstudents in the journalism, newspaper, yearbook, or writing classes\nand distributed to the student body either free or for a fee.\n<br /><br />\nNothing in this section shall prohibit or prevent any governing\nboard of a school district from adopting otherwise valid rules and\nregulations relating to oral communication by students upon the\npremises of each school.\n<br /><br />\nAn employee shall not be dismissed, suspended, disciplined, reassigned, transferred, or otherwise retaliated against solely for acting to protect a pupil engaged in the conduct authorized under this section, or refusing to infringe upon conduct that is protected by this section, the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, or Section 2 of Article I of the California Constitution.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Specific_provisions\">Specific provisions</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=California_Education_Code_48907&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Specific provisions\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>School authorities can only prohibit publication of stories in school newspapers if they are obscene, libelous, slanderous, or likely to incite others to commit illegal or disruptive acts. Additionally, school districts may not censor, even if the above conditions are met, if the district has not adopted in written form rules and regulations including reasonable provisions for the time, place, and manner in which issues of censorship may be addressed or settled. Thus, even if material falls within the realm of obscene, defamatory, illegal, or disruptive, all reasonable restrictions on school newspapers, school officials may not censor student material simply because no written school district regulations governing publications exist.\n</p><p>Also, a school district rule which generally prohibits such potentially sensitive topics as pregnancy and divorce is not permitted by the statute.\n</p><p>In issues of school liability, often stemming from libel or defamation lawsuits, the majority opinion in Leeb v. Delong 1988 stated that to impose a prior restraint requires the article to contain a \u201cfalse statement\u2026likely to harm the reputation of another\u2026\u201d and cannot be allowed \u201cto hinge on the subjective pique\u201d of a prospective plaintiff. This again holds the school to a high level of free speech protection before being allowed to censor.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Additionally, Leeb v. Delong holds that a lack of \u201cprofessional standards of English and journalism\u201d is not justification for prior restraint; post-publication responses are the only way to maintain these standards.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Recent_usage\">Recent usage</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=California_Education_Code_48907&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Recent usage\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>This policy and Education Code 48907 was supported by the case <i>Smith v. Novato Unified School District</i> (2007). A California Court of Appeal found that school unlawfully disciplined by condemning a controversial editorial as a violation of school policy and stating it should not have been published. The editorial, titled \u201cImmigration,\u201d contained extremely controversial statements about illegal immigrants. The principal, soon after the newspaper\u2019s release, ordered that all remaining copies of the newspaper no longer distributed. Smith sued the school district, and the Marin County Superior Court ruled against him; however, the First District Court of Appeal reversed the decision, stating that Code 48907 prohibits schools from censoring speech simply \u201cbecause it presents controversial ideas and opponents of the speech are likely to cause disruption.\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=California_Education_Code_48907&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Leonard_Law\" title=\"Leonard Law\">Leonard Law</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Student_Press_Law_Center\" title=\"Student Press Law Center\">Student Press Law Center</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Student_rights\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Student rights\">Student rights</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=California_Education_Code_48907&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Leaming, Jeremy.
