The Committee for Academic Freedom in Africa (CAFA) was an organisation set up in light of the struggles in the universities consequent to the implementation of the Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP).

They took on the role of coordinators and produced their first newsletter in spring 1991. and were later joined by Ousseina Alidou, Alamin Mazrui, Andrew Nash and Nigel Gibson.
