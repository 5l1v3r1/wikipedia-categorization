SAT Subject Tests are 20 multiple-choice standardized tests given by the College Board on individual subjects. They are typically taken to improve a student's credentials for admission to colleges in the United States. Many colleges use the SAT Subject Tests for admission, course placement, and to advise students about course selection. Some colleges specify the SAT Subject Tests that they require for admission or placement; others allow applicants to choose which tests to take. Students typically choose which tests to take depending upon college entrance requirements for the schools to which they plan to apply. From their introduction in 1937 until 1994, the SAT Subject Tests were known as Achievement Tests, and until January 2005, they were known as SAT II: Subject Tests. They are still commonly known by these names. Every test is now a one-hour timed test. Historically, the exception to the one-hour time was the writing test, which was divided into a 20-minute essay question and a 40-minute multiple-choice section. The writing test was discontinued in January 2005. A student may take up to three SAT Subject Tests on any given date at a flat rate. There is a per-administration registration fee, plus a flat fee for each test the student plans to take. Students aren't required to take the same number of tests they signed up for, nor are they required to take the same tests they initially indicated when filling out the registration form (except for language with listening tests).  If one takes more tests than initially paid for, he/she will be billed later for the additional test(s). Students eligible for an SAT fee waiver are allowed to take up to six subject tests in up to two administrations free of charge.  With the exception of the March test administration, SAT Subject Tests are offered on the same days as the regular SAT Reasoning Test; therefore, students cannot take both the SAT Reasoning Test and Subject Tests on the same day. In addition, not all Subject tests are offered on every test date. Most non-foreign language tests are offered in every administration, but World History and foreign-language tests are only available on certain dates. In particular, the language tests with listening are available only once a year, in November. Typically, the subject tests are administered in August, October, November, December, May and June.  A calendar of test dates and registration deadlines can be found on The College Board's official website.  There are currently 20 different tests, 12 of which are foreign language. Examinees are required to bring an acceptable calculator to take the Mathematics tests (calculators are not permitted on any other test), and a CD player to take the language with listening tests.    647 (M) 110 (M) These were discontinued after January 2005 when the SAT II in Writing was incorporated into the SAT. Each individual test is scored on a scale of 200 to 800; however, some of the tests are scored on such generous curves that it is impossible to get a 200; for example, if someone gets every question wrong on the Mathematics Level 2 test, he/she might receive a score of 310; it all depends on the version of the test.  The one and only exception was the ELPT, which was scored on a scale of 901 to 999. Prior to the first administration of the new SAT Reasoning Test (which includes the writing section) in March 2005, some highly selective colleges required applicants to take three SAT Subject Tests, including the writing test and two other tests of the applicant's choosing, in addition to the SAT. However, with writing now a standard component of the SAT Reasoning Test, most selective colleges recommend applicants to submit scores for any two SAT Subject Tests. Engineering schools may recommend or require Chemistry or Physics and Math Level 2.       A handful of the most competitive schools still require three Subject Tests in addition to the three sections of the SAT Reasoning Test,  while schools such as Georgetown and Harvard, which earlier required three Subject Tests, now 'strongly recommend' taking three Subject Tests.  Schools also vary with regard to their SAT Subject Test requirements of students submitting scores for the ACT in place of the SAT: some schools consider the ACT an alternative to both the SAT and some SAT Subject Tests, whereas others accept the ACT but require SAT Subject Tests as well. Information about a school's specific test requirements can typically be found on its official website. In October 2002, the College Board decided to drop the "Score Choice" option for exams, due to the fact that it disproportionally benefited wealthier students taking the exam who could afford to take it multiple times. Score Choice means that scores are not released to colleges until the student approves the score after seeing it.  However, the "Score Choice" option was reinstated as of the March 2009 test, meaning test takers again have the ability to choose whether or not to send scores.  The answer sheet has room for 115 answers; however, no test has more than 95 questions. 1–100 are standard multiple-choice bubbles and 101–115 are for 'relationship analysis questions', which are only used for the chemistry exam. The biology test is the only test to use answers 96–100; questions 1–60 are common to both the E and M tests, in addition, the E uses 61–80, and the M uses 81–100.
