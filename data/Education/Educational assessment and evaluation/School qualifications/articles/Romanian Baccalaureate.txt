The Bacalaureat (or bac for short) is an exam held in Romania and Moldova when one graduates high school (Romanian: liceu). Unlike the French Baccalaureate, the Romanian one has a single degree. The subjects (except subject A) depend on the profile studied (Romanian: profil de studiu): mathematics and computer science (Romanian: matematică-informatică), philology (Romanian: filologie), natural sciences (Romanian: științe ale naturii), social sciences (Romanian: științe sociale), or various other vocational tracks (Romanian: filiera vocaţională), and the candidate's choice. The Hungarian minority living in Romania and taking baccalaureate examination translate Bacalaureat into Érettségi, which means maturity, like the Spanish Matura. Diploma de Bacalaureat is translated into Érettségi Diploma. The marking scale is between 1 and 10. In order to pass, students must obtain at least 5.00 in every subject with a minimum of 6.00 overall. Moldavian Bacalaureat consists of four exams. Pupils from schools with a language of instruction other than Romanian must take one supplementary exam in their native language and literature. Exams usually take place in June. All of them are written and each is graded separately. Students must also choose one more subject taught in school. The majority take Geography or Chemistry. The baccalaureate has up to 5 modules, each one graded separately. Module E, the written examination, is the one considered for admission to higher education. A, B and D are marked with: Beginner, Average, Advanced and Experienced. Each exam takes three hours.
