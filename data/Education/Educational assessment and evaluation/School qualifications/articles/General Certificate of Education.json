Thus England, Scotland and Northern Ireland have distinct education systems. Wales was politically subsumed into England during the Tudur era in the sixteenth century and only re-emerged as a political jurisdiction with the establishment of the Welsh Assembly in 1997, hence the term \"England and Wales\". \n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"England_and_Wales\">England and Wales</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=General_Certificate_of_Education&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: England and Wales\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The General Certificate of Education (GCE) was established in England and Wales after the second world war, along with the Certificate of Secondary Education (CSE). Both these examinations set out to provide a national standard of public examinations, within the wider reform of secondary education under the Education Act of 1943 (The Baker Act). Prior to the second world war the standards of education offered by different local education authorities varied widely, whilst some urban education authorities supported  Technical Schools others particularly in rural areas, offered only \"Higher Elementary\" education to the majority of pupils. The Education Act of 1943 established a strategy to deliver a universal secondary education system fit for the post-war social and economic reconstruction of the country. It envisaged three distinct types of schools: Grammar schools, Technical Schools and Secondary Modern Schools, all to be provided at public expense and each of which where intended to provide education appropriate to the abilities and aspirations of their pupils. The syllabii and examination standards of both GCE and CSE should be seen in this context. \n</p><p>The General Certificate of Education set out to provide a national standard for matriculation to university undergraduate courses. It had two levels, Ordinary and Advanced which rapidly became known throughout the education system as \"O levels\" and \"A Levels\". Ordinary levels were usually taken at the age of 16 - the statutory minimum school leaving age and Advanced levels at the age of 18 after a further two year course. Both the O level and A level courses were examined by subject and matriculation (the minimum standard for university entrance) was set at five passes in different subjects of which two had to be at A level. \n</p><p>For matriculation purposes the highest grade pass of a subject taken at CSE level was considered a pass at O level.\n</p><p>In the English education system both the GCE and CSE examinations were replaced in the 1980's with the General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE), which set out to provide a multi level examination system catering for all abilities of secondary school pupils. This supported the ongoing development of a comprehensive education system, which recognised education as a fundamental human right, and sought to avoid the risk of writing children off at the age of eleven which had become apparent as an undesirable by-product of the 11+ selection system\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Examination_Boards_.28England.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Examination_Boards_(England)\">Examination Boards (England)</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=General_Certificate_of_Education&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Examination Boards (England)\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Though the GCE was considerd a national standard there was no national syllabus, and it was run by a number of different Examination Boards, each of which set their own syllabii and papers. These included the \"Northern Universities Joint Matriculation Board\" - generally known as the JMB, The University of London \"The London Board\" and the \"Oxford and Cambridge Board\". \n</p><p>Examination sessions were held bi-annually in May and November and successful candidates received a certificate listing the subjects they had passed in the session, together with the marks achieved in each. In the earliest years of the system subject marks were given as percentages at both Ordinary and Advanced Level. \nIn later years  ordinary level pass marks were graded 1-6, with 1 being the highest. The grading system was further simplified in 1975 when the six pass marks were reduced to three graded A, B, C. In normalised terms at O level the lower bound for A was then 70% and the lower bound for C 45%. For matriculation purposes C was the lowest pass grade. D, E and F grades were also shown for the first time- rather embarrassingly indicating that a paper had been sat but the student had not achieved a pass mark.\n</p><p>In the late 1970's A level certificates showed grades from A to F. At A level E was considered a pass for matriculation and corresponded to 30%. All these examinations were closed book and Art was the only subject for which any assignment outside the examination hall contributed to the final mark.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Scotland\">Scotland</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=General_Certificate_of_Education&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Scotland\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>GCE Ordinary and Advanced levels did not exist within the Scottish Education system, but had an equivalent, administered by the Scottish Education Department, part of the Scottish Office. This  predated the GCE and also had two levels, originally called Higher Grade and Lower Grade. Lower grade was renamed the Ordinary Grade around the time that the GCE O level was established. The two were exact equivalents. Higher grade however was a lower level course than the A level and taken over one year- preparing students for entry to Scottish Universities which had 4 year degree courses, traditionally commenced at the age of 17.\n</p><p>The Scottish \"O grade\" was replaced by a new examination, the \"standard grade\" phased in over several years in the late 1980's. This in turn has been replaced (2015-18) by a new examination the \"National Level 5\" , however the Higher examination remains the matriculation standard for Scottish Universities, though most school leavers destined for university today remain for a further year in School taking further courses ( up to date information needed on this ) \n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Northern_Ireland\">Northern Ireland</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=General_Certificate_of_Education&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Northern Ireland\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The secondary education system in Northern Ireland continues to use the GCE Ordinary and Advanced level system.

The results for the GCE O-Level and A-level exams in Cameroon are announced around mid-July.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=General_Certificate_of_Education&amp;action=edit&amp;section=16\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-UCASIntQuals-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\">^ <a href=\"#cite_ref-UCASIntQuals_1-0\"><sup><i><b>a</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-UCASIntQuals_1-1\"><sup><i><b>b</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-UCASIntQuals_1-2\"><sup><i><b>c</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-UCASIntQuals_1-3\"><sup><i><b>d</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-UCASIntQuals_1-4\"><sup><i><b>e</b></i></sup></a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><cite class=\"citation web\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.arts.ac.uk/media/arts/colleges/lcf/courses/application-forms/int-quals2013.pdf\">\"International Qualifications for entry into college or university in 2013\"</a> <span style=\"font-size:85%;\">(PDF)</span>. <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20161225115515/http://www.arts.ac.uk/media/arts/colleges/lcf/courses/application-forms/int-quals2013.pdf\">Archived</a> <span style=\"font-size:85%;\">(PDF)</span> from the original on 25 December 2016.</cite><span title=\"ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Abook&amp;rft.genre=unknown&amp;rft.btitle=International+Qualifications+for+entry+into+college+or+university+in+2013&amp;rft_id=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.arts.ac.uk%2Fmedia%2Farts%2Fcolleges%2Flcf%2Fcourses%2Fapplication-forms%2Fint-quals2013.pdf&amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fen.wikipedia.org%3AGeneral+Certificate+of+Education\" class=\"Z3988\"><span style=\"display:none;\">&#160;</span></span></span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-ChavegnesUSInfo-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-ChavegnesUSInfo_2-0\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><cite class=\"citation web\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.chavagnes.org/news/Info_for_US_families.shtml\">\"Info for US Families\"</a>.
