wanted to pursue further education, but some students took individual examinations to increase their chance of continuing their study or to fulfil certain requirements in tertiary education programs. \n</p><p>The final year in which school candidates were accepted was 2010. There were 127,162 candidates entered for the examination, 90,063 of them school candidates and 37,099 private candidates.\n</p><p>The HKCEE was conducted from late February to June, but major subjects were taken between mid-April and May, after the major subjects examination in the <a href=\"/wiki/Hong_Kong_Advanced_Level_Examination\" title=\"Hong Kong Advanced Level Examination\">Hong Kong Advanced Level Examination</a> were completed, by the Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority (<a href=\"/wiki/HKEAA\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"HKEAA\">HKEAA</a>). Oral examinations were conducted in late May to early July.\n</p><p>Examination results were released in early August, traditionally on the Wednesday after the first-round admission of the <a href=\"/wiki/Joint_University_Programmes_Admissions_System\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Joint University Programmes Admissions System\">Joint University Programmes Admissions System</a> had been released. There were 39 subjects available in the HKCEE. Most day-school candidates took 6 to 8 subjects in the HKCEE, with 10 being the upper limit. Apart from Chinese and English, which were taken by almost every school candidate, and language-specific subjects (French, <a href=\"/wiki/Chinese_History\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Chinese History\">Chinese History</a> (Chinese only), <a href=\"/wiki/Buddhism\" title=\"Buddhism\">Buddhist Studies</a> (Chinese only), Literature in English (English only), <a href=\"/wiki/Putonghua\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Putonghua\">Putonghua</a> (Chinese only) and <a href=\"/wiki/Word_Processing\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Word Processing\">Word Processing</a> and Business Communication (English only), all subjects could be taken in either Chinese or English. The same standards were applied in marking and grading regardless of the choice of language, and the language medium was not recorded on the results notices or certificates. It was, however, recorded on admission forms.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Purpose\">Purpose</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Hong_Kong_Certificate_of_Education_Examination&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Purpose\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>After sitting the HKCEE and having their examination results announced, candidates could apply for a place in sixth form in local schools in Hong Kong. Moreover, to qualify for the <a href=\"/wiki/Hong_Kong_Advanced_Level_Examination\" title=\"Hong Kong Advanced Level Examination\">Hong Kong Advanced Level Examination</a> (HKALE), students had to pass certain requirements of HKCEE as a prerequisite. The <a href=\"/wiki/Joint_University_Programmes_Admissions_System\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Joint University Programmes Admissions System\">Joint University Programmes Admissions System</a> (JUPAS), including the <a href=\"/wiki/Early_Admission_Scheme_(Hong_Kong)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Early Admission Scheme (Hong Kong)\">EAS system</a> under JUPAS, also considered students' HKCEE results as a requirement and as a decisive factor of admission in the admission processes. Thus, students' results in HKCEE affected their application to sixth form but also directly affected the chance of entering the universities after seventh form, which was commonly ignored by students until they entered sixth form. In JUPAS, most admissions programs gave HKCEE results about a 10\u201330% weight, and some as much as 50%; the HKALE results provided the other 50%.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> Thus, HKCEE was the initial stage of University Entrance Examination.\n</p><p>The HKCEE was fully recognised by other countries including New Zealand, Australia, the UK, the US and many other major countries. It was equivalent to Year 11 in Australia and in the UK.\n</p><p>For comparison, the Mathematics syllabus of HKCEE was equivalent to New Zealand's <a href=\"/wiki/National_Certificate_of_Educational_Achievement\" title=\"National Certificate of Educational Achievement\">National Certificate of Educational Achievement</a> Level 2 Mathematics at Form 6 (Year 12) level (excluding Calculus) rather than NCEA Level 1 or its predecessor the <a href=\"/wiki/School_Certificate_(New_Zealand)\" title=\"School Certificate (New Zealand)\">School Certificate</a> examination, sat by the country's Form 5 (Year 11) students.\n</p><p>Additional Mathematics in the HKCEE was  more advanced than NCEA Level 3 Mathematics with Calculus, sat by Form 7 (Year 13) students in New Zealand to gain university entrance in science and engineering. HKCEE's Additional Mathematics was also recognised by most of the programs in Hong Kong's universities as equivalent to <a href=\"/wiki/HKALE\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"HKALE\">HKALE</a> Pure Mathematics.\n</p><p>For the examination questions on the same topics, those in HKCEE tended to be loaded with unclear wordings and difficult manipulations<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template\" style=\"margin-left:0.1em; white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify\" title=\"Wikipedia:Please clarify\"><span title=\"The text near this tag may need clarification or removal of jargon.

Obtaining an A is very difficult, especially for languages in the past system, where only about 1.5\u20133% of students received A's. On average, only the top 3\u20134% in each subject can get an A. The cutoff scores vary greatly from subject to subject and from year to year. To give a clearer picture, for Chinese, A-grades are sometimes given for candidates having scored 70 or above, while for Mathematics, an A invariably translates to a score in excess of 90.

Under the new system There are seven grades: five numerical grades from 1\u20135, where 1 is the lowest and 5 is the highest, and two other grades, \"5*\" and \"UNCL\", for students with particularly outstanding and poor performance respectively. The traditional \"on-the-curve\" system was not used other than to distinguish between the 5*'s and the 5's.\n</p><p>The point system was in chaos in its first year of implementation since level 2, which is the passing line in HKEAA, counts as two points in some schools and the HKEAA, but counts as one point in EMB and most schools. This counting process not only confused Form 5 students, but also some Form 6 students who repeated the exam to obtain better Language results for JUPAS admissions.  The problems with the points system caused changes in the method for calculating points in HKEAA in the following years.\n</p><p>Since the two syllabi in English were merged into one along with the new system, some schools were worried that the level of English is insufficient for the HKALE as they expect HKEAA will decrease the difficulty to allow students who previously studied in Syllabus A(mainly from some non-EMI schools) to pass more easily. This resulted in some schools rejecting students who had a level 2 in English.\n</p><p>The system will be fully utilised in all major subjects in the HKDSE.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Further_Studies\">Further Studies</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Hong_Kong_Certificate_of_Education_Examination&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Further Studies\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Students' results in HKCEE and their conduct (behavior at school which is usually shown in the school's internal report) at school are the main admission factors in Secondary 6, which is the main stream for university admission.

Students with 14 marks above, including passes in English and one other Language subject have an advantage as they can be admitted from the first stage of Form 6 admissions.

Standards of performance in the HKCEE and HKALE have for many years been benchmarked against standards in comparable subjects at British GCE O-Level and A/AS-Level. In the case of performance in the English Language, studies have been conducted to link standards of performance in HKCEE English Language (Syllabus B) and HKALE Use of English to standards in <a href=\"/wiki/IELTS\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"IELTS\">IELTS</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/TOEFL\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"TOEFL\">TOEFL</a>.\n</p><p>Starting from 2007, HKCEE standards-referenced reporting was adopted in Chinese language and English language subjects. The results in the two subjects have also been benchmarked against International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE) results.\n</p><p>The Hong Kong Diploma for Secondary Education Examination (HKDSE) will be conducted for the first time in 2012. To secure appropriate recognition of HKDSE qualifications, the HKEAA has been holding discussions with international agencies including <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_Cambridge_International_Examinations\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"University of Cambridge International Examinations\">University of Cambridge International Examinations</a> (CIE), <a href=\"/wiki/National_Academic_Recognition_Information_Centre\" title=\"National Academic Recognition Information Centre\">National Academic Recognition Information Centre</a> (NARIC), <a href=\"/wiki/UCAS\" title=\"UCAS\">Universities and Colleges Admissions Service</a> (UCAS) in the UK and the <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Australian_Education_International&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Australian Education International (page does not exist)\">Australian Education International</a> (AEI) in Australia to conduct benchmarking and comparability research on HKDSE.\n</p><p>Although HKEAA examinations have been widely accepted, some universities have set particular criteria for admission of overseas students.

The official argument from the HKEAA for not publishing these marking schemes was that it might be \"pedagogically unsound\" and would encourage \"rote memorisation\" behaviour from students. Nevertheless, students were often able to obtain these \"restricted documents\" by taking classes at <a href=\"/wiki/Cram_schools_in_Hong_Kong\" title=\"Cram schools in Hong Kong\">cram schools</a>. Hence, the policy of the HKEAA indirectly denied less privileged students from gaining access to information pertaining to how examination papers are scored. This might have created a socio-economic bias in the ability of students to obtain good results in the HKCEE. Moreover, according to media reports, some so-called \"star tutors\" managed to earn more than <a href=\"/wiki/Hong_Kong_dollar\" title=\"Hong Kong dollar\">HK$</a>7 million per annum (~<a href=\"/wiki/United_States_dollar\" title=\"United States dollar\">US$</a>900,000), leading some to speculate that the HKEAA's policy had indirectly transferred large amounts of wealth to these cram schools.\n</p><p>To deal with this problem, the HKEAA started to release the marking schemes together with the year's examination papers in 2003.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"HKSAR_Government_Scholarship\">HKSAR Government Scholarship</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Hong_Kong_Certificate_of_Education_Examination&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: HKSAR Government Scholarship\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The HKSAR Government Scholarship is a prestigious award associated with the HKCEE Examination.

Rather than calculating the number of A's each student has, the HKSAR Government Scholarship is awarded on the basis of the highest total in raw scores attained in the seven best subjects of each student.

The problem was so severe that some students wrongfully received an F grade (the second-lowest grade) when they were supposed to receive an A (the highest grade) in the oral section. Since the final English mark is calculated by averaging the marks in the oral, reading comprehension, listening, and writing sections, having an F in oral would have seriously affected the final English mark if the candidate did well in other components.\n</p><p>In an attempt to mitigate the situation, the HKEAA publicly apologised and offered free rechecks on the oral component of the English language subject for all candidates. Candidates who would have had a higher score if the error had not occurred received an upgrade.

That led to assumption that the tutor had knowledge of the question in the actual exam.\n</p><p>Two students lodged a complaint to the. A spokesperson of the HKEAA stated that copying by candidates will result in no marks given to the plagiarised parts.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"2007_English_Language_questions_leakage_incident\">2007 English Language questions leakage incident</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Hong_Kong_Certificate_of_Education_Examination&amp;action=edit&amp;section=18\" title=\"Edit section: 2007 English Language questions leakage incident\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Before the examination date of English Language Papers in 2007, \"Mr. Ken\", one of the well-known tutors at the Modern Education Centre in Hong Kong, called his students back to the tutorial centre for a few days before the test to review some material on fashion. It was later found that the actual test had some of the same topics and even some questions identical that were identical, fuelling worries of a possible leakage.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"2008_Chinese_Language_incident\">2008 Chinese Language incident</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Hong_Kong_Certificate_of_Education_Examination&amp;action=edit&amp;section=19\" title=\"Edit section: 2008 Chinese Language incident\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Controversies were in two papers: paper 1, comprehension, and paper 5, integrated skills.\n</p><p>In paper 1, the format in previous years was that two passages were supplied, one in <a href=\"/wiki/Vernacular_Chinese\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Vernacular Chinese\">Vernacular Chinese</a> and one in <a href=\"/wiki/Classical_Chinese\" title=\"Classical Chinese\">Classical Chinese</a>, and candidates were required to answer questions mainly in words. In 2008, however, the second passage was a <a href=\"/wiki/Chinese_poetry\" title=\"Chinese poetry\">Chinese poem</a> instead. Also, half of the total scores were from <a href=\"/wiki/Multiple_choice\" title=\"Multiple choice\">multiple choice</a> questions, and in some questions, choices were said to be difficult to distinguish. For example, in question 5, the four choices were \"believable\" (\u53ef\u4ee5\u76f8\u4fe1), \"affirmative\" (\u80af\u5b9a\u7684\u662f), \"proved by facts\" (\u4e8b\u5be6\u8b49\u660e) and \"undeniable\" (\u7121\u53ef\u5426\u8a8d). Some teachers said that they could not even make the relevant decisions in a short period of time or said that the paper required deduction skills and common sense rather than Chinese knowledge, and some candidates said the paper was more like gambling than an examination. Some also commented that the passages were too difficult for CE level. Even a university professor admitted that he could not finish the exam in a reasonable amount of time. The first Vernacular Chinese passage was said to be of the difficulty of Form 7 <a href=\"/wiki/Hong_Kong_Advanced_Level_Examination\" title=\"Hong Kong Advanced Level Examination\">Advanced Level Examination</a> Chinese Language and Culture, and the second poem, <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Moonlight_of_Spring_River&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Moonlight of Spring River (page does not exist)\">Moonlight of Spring River</a> (\u6625\u6c5f\u82b1\u6708\u591c) in <a href=\"/wiki/Tang_Dynasty\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Tang Dynasty\">Tang Dynasty</a>, was said to be of the difficulty of university Chinese.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> the HKESA replied that papers can be set in any format and style.\n</p><p>In paper 5, candidates were required to listen to a recording and do various tasks, but both the recording and the data file were criticised. A <a href=\"/wiki/Halloween\" title=\"Halloween\">Halloween</a> advertisement was included in the recording, and some candidates afterward said that they felt uneasy or thought the radio channel was switched. In the data file, Chinese slang terms were discussed in an extract from a newspaper article and in a poster promoting reading. Some teachers and students criticised the materials for promoting slang terms, some students said that they had not heard of such terms and others said that the HKEAA had misconceptions about the use of the slang terms. The Authority responded that, as is the norm, some of the materials provided were deliberately false or worthless to promote critical thinking and choice-taking by students.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>On <a href=\"/wiki/YouTube\" title=\"YouTube\">YouTube</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Internet_forum\" title=\"Internet forum\">Internet forums</a>, ringtones of the recording appeared after the paper, including the imitation of <a href=\"/wiki/Cantopop\" title=\"Cantopop\">Cantopop</a> duo <a href=\"/wiki/Twins_(group)\" title=\"Twins (group)\">Twins</a> singing their song, \"Lian Ai Da Guo Tian\" (\u6200\u611b\u5927\u904e\u5929, Love Is More Important Than Anything), and the recording of the Halloween advertisement.\n</p><p>Some candidates also suggested actions to protest the difficulty of the comprehension paper by wearing black clothes and staying on seats after the end of examinations on 2 May and 3 May 2008, when the English Language examinations were held.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Publishing\">Publishing</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Hong_Kong_Certificate_of_Education_Examination&amp;action=edit&amp;section=20\" title=\"Edit section: Publishing\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>As a regular practice, the HKEAA published past papers, marking schemes and examination reports every year.

Marking schemes were to be given only to markers.\n</p><p>From 2003, the authority issued the examination report and the question papers in year form, which included a question paper, suggested answers (changed to marking schemes from 2005), and candidates' performance and examination statistics; the price ranged from HK$20\u201345.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Hong_Kong_Certificate_of_Education_Examination&amp;action=edit&amp;section=21\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Education_in_Hong_Kong\" title=\"Education in Hong Kong\">Education in Hong Kong</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/HKALE\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"HKALE\">Hong Kong Advanced Level Examination</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Hong_Kong_Certificate_of_Education_Examination&amp;action=edit&amp;section=22\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">JUPAS Walkthrough 2008, Mingpao Education Net, 2007</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-2\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><cite class=\"citation news\">Yung, Chester (13 August 2005). <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20090404031739/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/stdn/std/Metro/GH13Ak01.html\">\"Exams body in another blunder\"</a>. <a href=\"/wiki/The_Standard_(Hong_Kong)\" title=\"The Standard (Hong Kong)\">The Standard</a>.
