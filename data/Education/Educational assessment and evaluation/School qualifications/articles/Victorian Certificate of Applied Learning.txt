The Victorian Certificate of Applied Learning (VCAL) is a 'hands-on' option for students in Years 11 and 12 and is a credential awarded to secondary school students who successfully complete year 11 and 12 in the Australian State of Victoria. The VCAL gives students practical work-related experience, as well as literacy and numeracy skills and the opportunity to build personal skills that are important for life and work. Like the Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE), VCAL is an accredited senior secondary school qualification.   Further information in regards to attaining a VCAL can be found on than the Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Authority.    VCAL is a practical education stream, where students may work in a trade or part-time job on some days of the week and supplement this by doing a set course at school. In 2012, the Victorian Liberal/National Coalition, under the leadership of Ted Baillieu made large funding cuts (over $300m) to the TAFE public education system, a major deliverer of VCAL courses for the youth and mature aged students, and cut funding to Secondary school VCAL programs.  This resulted in students being unable to access many courses and job losses for VCAL co-ordinators in secondary schools.  VCAL is also referred to as "veggie school"
