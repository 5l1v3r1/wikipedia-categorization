These two years are normally completed either at separate campuses of <a href=\"/wiki/List_of_schools_in_Tasmania#Independent_schools\" title=\"List of schools in Tasmania\">Tasmanian independent schools</a>, or at government <a href=\"/wiki/List_of_schools_in_Tasmania#Colleges\" title=\"List of schools in Tasmania\">colleges</a>.\n</p><p>The onus of TCE education is the promotion of independent learning for students, with the aim of equipping students to be able to learn independently of guided education.

This basically means students can be assessed depending upon their meeting or successful completion of standards and criteria. These criteria usually assess knowledge, skills and competencies in differing ways to ensure a wide understanding of the course <a href=\"/wiki/Syllabus\" title=\"Syllabus\">syllabus</a> has been obtained by the student. It is felt that this is fair and more practical that just relying upon traditional examinations, although many areas of study still utilise exams in conjunction with other methods of assessment.\n</p><p>Subjects are offered at varying levels of difficulty, ranging from a basic understanding, through to a pre-tertiary entrance qualification. The difficulty of a subject is guided by its rating as a 1-3 level subject. Subjects are also given an A, B or C rating based on the number of hours that are required for the course, C being the longest. In this way, all subjects will have a rating such as 3A, or 2C etc., depending on the time it involves and the difficulty of the work involved.\n</p><p>C level subjects can also be offered as pre-tertiary (level 3C), and for students wishing to gain university entrance, enough points from pre-tertiary entrance subjects must be obtained to gain a Tertiary Entrance Rank (TER) score above the requirements for the applied  course.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Award\">Award</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Tasmanian_Certificate_of_Education&amp;action=edit&amp;section=15\" title=\"Edit section: Award\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Upon successful completion of a satisfactory pattern of study students are awarded the \"Tasmanian Certificate of Education\" (TCE) by way of a <a href=\"/wiki/Testamur\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Testamur\">testamur</a>.
