The Northern Territory Certificate of Education (NTCE) is the credential awarded to High School students who successfully complete senior high school level studies (years 11 and 12 or equivalent) in the Northern Territory, Australia. NTCE is normally taught in years 11 and 12 of senior high school in the Northern Territory. There are two levels: Stage 1, generally taught in Year 11, and Stage 2, taught in Year 12. At least 22 approved units must be studied. Each NTCE subject is organised into units, there is a list of subjects available to senior secondary students through Territory schools. Students can select up to 9 free choice units from Stage 1 and/or Stage 2 subject offerings. Each territory school can provide a list of senior subjects it offers. Secondary students work towards the Northern Territory Certificate of Education. The Northern Territory Board of Studies issues the certificate to students who meet the requirements of achievement during their studies. The TER is calculated by the South Australian Tertiary Admissions Centre (SATAC) for students who successfully complete the Northern Territory Certificate of Education (NTCE) and fulfill certain other criteria to qualify for a TER. Results for the NTCE are forwarded to SATAC by the Northern Territory Board of Studies.
