In Uganda, students receive the Uganda Advanced Certificate of Education (UACE) when they finish the 2-year upper secondary school which is also called the HSC. It is comparable to GCE A-Level in the UK. UACE is also known colloquially as "A-Level". The examinations for the UACE are administered by the Uganda National Examinations Board (UNEB).  these examinations are administered countrywide to all registered schools and students. All students are subjected to the same grading scale.
