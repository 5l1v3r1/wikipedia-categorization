Members of the Council hold office for a period of three years. The Chairman (who is eligible for re-election) and Deputy Chairman are elected from among the members of Council to hold office for three years or for the unexpired term of their appointments as members of the Council. The Council organises its business on a triennial basis, using the calendar year as its operative year. The Registrar is the Chief Executive of the Council and the Council may delegate to him any of its duties relating to the holding of examinations and the appointments of staff members other than himself or the Pro-Registrar. The Caribbean Examinations Council offers three levels of examinations and certifications: The CXC Associate Degree Programme was unveiled in 2005, it is a tertiary qualification based on the CAPE certification. While it may vary by territory, the CSECs are generally viewed as an employment qualification certifying the holder as a secondary school graduate. While the CAPE is considered a suitable qualification for entry into tertiary education. The island territories of Saint Maarten and Saba - both part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands - also conduct exams administered by the Council. In 1993, the Caribbean Examinations Council Act was commenced to secure the integrity of examinations conducted by the council.
