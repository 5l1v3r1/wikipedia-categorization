The Advanced International Certificate of Education (AICE) is an academically rigorous, internationally used, specialized, English language curriculum offered to students in the higher levels of secondary school intended to prepare them for an honours programme during tertiary education.  The curriculum is overseen by Cambridge International Examinations which is a branch of Cambridge Assessment and operates globally.  It includes classes in the subject areas of mathematics and science; languages; and arts and humanities with two levels of difficulty Advanced Subsidiary level and Advanced level with Advanced level being more challenging.  It is mandatory for a student to have taken and passed a subject on the Advanced Level. Students need to select subject from 4 different groups (Group 1: Mathematics and Sciences, Group 2: Languages, Group 3: Arts and Humanities, Group 4: Interdisciplinary and skills-based subjects (optional)). Successful completion of the program within a thirteen-month period confers a Cambridge AICE Diploma.  Three levels of diploma—Pass Level, with Merit and with Distinction—are offered based on the number of points that a student receives; these points depend upon factors such as the grade earned in an AICE class and the level of the class taken.  To successfully complete the curriculum, a student must achieve at least 120 points with a minimum of seven credits in courses spread across the subject areas. The United States has identified AICE as a graduation option and acceleration mechanism through which students can be awarded up to 45 hours of college credit.  Students earning the AICE Diploma in Florida qualify for the Florida Bright Futures Academic Scholarship while students completing the curriculum can earn the Medallion tuition scholarship.
