Some students preferred the vocational system due to its practical 'hands-on' nature.\n</p><p>The qualification was created in September 2000 to replace the Advanced <a href=\"/wiki/GNVQ\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"GNVQ\">GNVQ</a>, with the main change being that the marking system was altered from the three level Distinction, Merit and Pass system to A&#8211;E grading, bringing the AVCE into line with <a href=\"/wiki/Advanced_Level_(UK)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Advanced Level (UK)\">A-Levels</a>. The AVCE was intended to lead on to <a href=\"/wiki/Higher_education\" title=\"Higher education\">higher education</a> or employment and was made up of modules, each covering different aspects of the subject. Some of these modules overlapped and some institutions chose to merge their content. Students had to complete a set number of modules in order to qualify for an AVCE: \n</p>\n<ul><li>AVCE Double Award - 12 units (worth two A-levels)</li>\n<li>AVCE Single Award - 6 units (worth one A-level)</li>\n<li>ASVCE - 3 units (worth one AS-level)</li></ul>\n<p>Assessment was by a mixture of <a href=\"/wiki/Continuous_assessment\" title=\"Continuous assessment\">continuous assessment</a>, based on a portfolio of evidence, and externally set and marked examinations. \n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Withdrawal\">Withdrawal</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Vocational_Certificate_of_Education&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Withdrawal\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The regulatory body, the <a href=\"/wiki/Qualifications_and_Curriculum_Authority\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Qualifications and Curriculum Authority\">Qualifications and Curriculum Authority</a> (QCA), along with <a href=\"/wiki/Wales\" title=\"Wales\">Welsh</a> equivalent <a href=\"/wiki/ACCAC\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"ACCAC\">ACCAC</a>, decided in June 2004 to withdraw the Advanced VCE, with the final candidates starting in September 2004. They created and piloted an \"Applied GCE (<a href=\"/wiki/AGCE\" title=\"AGCE\">AGCE</a>)\" qualification to replace the AVCE. <a href=\"/wiki/Edexcel\" title=\"Edexcel\">Edexcel</a> withdrew AVCE ICT in June 2006 but students were able to re-submit coursework until November 2006 and could re-sit exams until January 2007. The <a href=\"/wiki/General_National_Vocational_Qualification\" title=\"General National Vocational Qualification\">GNVQ</a> is still currently available in two forms &#8211; Foundation and Intermediate levels &#8211; which both work up to the Advanced level. This was withdrawn in 2007. The decision to withdraw the qualification proved unpopular.\n</p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw1242\nCached time: 20180911200327\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.044 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.067 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 82/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 4149/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 13/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 6/40\nExpensive parser function count: 1/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\nLua time usage: 0.018/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 818 KB/50 MB\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   51.734      1 Template:Unreferenced\n100.00%   51.734      1 -total\n 60.89%   31.500      1 Template:Ambox\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:895943-0!canonical and timestamp 20180911200327 and revision id 805530293\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[{"lang":"cy","url":"https://cy.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tystysgrif_Addysg_Galwedigaeth","langname":"Welsh","autonym":"Cymraeg","*":"Tystysgrif Addysg Galwedigaeth"}],"categories":[{"sortkey":"Vocational Certificate Of Education","hidden":"","*":"Articles_lacking_sources_from_December_2009"},{"sortkey":"Vocational Certificate Of Education","hidden":"","*":"All_articles_lacking_sources"},{"sortkey":"Vocational Certificate Of Education","*":"School_qualifications"},{"sortkey":"Vocational Certificate Of Education","*":"Educational_qualifications_in_the_United_Kingdom"}],"links":[{"ns":14,"exists":"","*":"Category:Articles lacking sources from December 2009"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"ACCAC"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"AGCE"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Advanced Level (UK)"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Continuous assessment"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Edexcel"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Further Education"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"GNVQ"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"General National Vocational Qualification"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Higher education"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Information technology"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Qualifications and Curriculum Authority"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Sixth form"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"United Kingdom"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Vocational education"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Wales"},{"ns":4,"exists":"","*":"Wikipedia:Citing sources"},{"ns":4,"exists":"","*":"Wikipedia:Verifiability"},{"ns":12,"exists":"","*":"Help:Introduction to referencing with Wiki Markup/1"},{"ns":12,"exists":"","*":"Help:Maintenance template removal"}],"templates":[{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Unreferenced"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Ambox"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Unsubst"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Message box"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:No globals"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Yesno"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Arguments"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Message box/configuration"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/data"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/config"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/shared"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/blacklist"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Namespace detect/data"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Namespace detect/config"}],"images":["Question_book-new.svg"],"externallinks":[],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Subjects and assessment","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Vocational_Certificate_of_Education","byteoffset":335,"anchor":"Subjects_and_assessment"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Withdrawal","number":"2","index":"2","fromtitle":"Vocational_Certificate_of_Education","byteoffset":1565,"anchor":"Withdrawal"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Vocational Certificate of Education","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"defaultsort","*":"Vocational Certificate Of Education"},{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q7939223"}]}}
