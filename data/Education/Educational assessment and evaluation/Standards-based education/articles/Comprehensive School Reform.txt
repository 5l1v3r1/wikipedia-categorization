The Comprehensive School Reform (CSR) program was a program administered by the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Elementary and Secondary Education. As established in the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, the purpose of the program was "to provide financial incentives for schools to develop comprehensive school reforms, based upon scientifically based research and effective practices that include an emphasis on basic academics and parental involvement so that all children can meet challenging state academic content and academic achievement standards."  The CSR program made its last award in 2005, although it continued to appropriate funds to one school in 2006-2008.
