This was the first election after the county was divided by Justice Department decree into commissioner districts. He was elected a San Juan County Commissioner and became the first Native American to hold such a position in the state of Utah. \n</p><p>An elected official, he realized even greater inequities in services given to his Navajo constituents. The Navajo people were bringing in more money for the county than they were receiving back in services. He mixed it up with the other commissioners, often battling the always capable <a href=\"/wiki/Utah_Republican_Party\" title=\"Utah Republican Party\">right-wing</a> former Commissioner Calvin Black, the undisputed kingpin of San Juan County politics, during hotly contested commission meetings. \n</p><p>Maryboy's four terms on the San Juan County Commission - particularly the first half-dozen years - were the subject of much press and the stuff of legend-making. His sword-crossing with the late commission chairman, Cal Black, spiked tensions across southern Utah as Maryboy fought for funding for roads, sanitation and water for Utah's Navajos.\n</p><p>In 1989 Navajo elders and other Democratic stalwarts determined to run a Navajo for every county post up for election. 56 percent of San Juan's population was Navajo at the time.  The campaign aimed at getting tribal members to the polls was called \"Niha-Whol-Zhiizh\", meaning \"It's our turn.\" \n</p><p>The Democratic-Navajo plan fizzled.
