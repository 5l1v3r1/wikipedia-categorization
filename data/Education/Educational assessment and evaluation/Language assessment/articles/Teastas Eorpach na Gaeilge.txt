The Teastas Eorpach na Gaeilge (TEG)  or European Certificate in Irish  is a set of examinations for adult learners of Irish. TEG is linked to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (Council of Europe, 2001).  It examines four skills: speaking, listening, reading and writing. Examinations are currently available at five levels from Beginners 1 (A1) to Advanced 1 (C1) and are run internationally. In 2016 exams were held in Sydney, New York, Ottawa, and nationally in Ireland. There is the option for candidates at all levels to undertake the full examination (Lánchreidiúint) or just the oral examination (partial credit). TEG is the first certification system for adult learners of Irish connected with the ALTE examination system / Council of Europe. It has previously developed such a system for the majority of other European languages. This system helps learners to plan their studies and gain recognition for the progress they have made. Another advantage of the system is that it gives educational institutions and employers on language ability of candidates for courses, jobs or promotions. Of particular importance to this since the provisions of the Official Languages Act (2003) in Ireland. The Language Centre in Maynooth is a member of ALTE (Association of Language Testers in Europe), monitors the content and quality of TEG.
