Unigram is a socio-educational platform that allows current undergraduates and alumni to assign ratings to universities and lecturers. Unigram is currently available in 53 African countries, and is Africa's largest website for lecturer and university ratings.   The site includes over 2000 schools, 14,000 lecturers, and over 6,000 ratings. University ratings are based on facilities, accommodation, security, a school's quality of education, research, and innovation. For lecturers, ratings are based on attendance, quality of teaching, student engagement/communication, teaching methods, and knowledge of the curriculum. Users who cannot find lecturers on the website can manually add them thereto. Unigram also uses a ranking algorithm to determine the top universities in each country.  The Staff at Unigram compile and release the top universities in Africa yearly. Unigram was founded in August 2016 by Dami Osiyale, Akinbola Asalu, Farawe iLyas and Ajibola Tosin.
