The following List of colleges and universities which have signed the Presidents Letter refers to a 2007 movement criticizing the practice of college rankings which developed among faculty and administrators in American Institutions of Higher Education. It follows previous movements in the U.S. and Canada (by schools in the 1990s such as Reed College, Stanford University,  Alma College, as well as a number of universities in Canada in 2006) which have criticized the practice of college rankings. The Presidents Letter (dated May 10, 2007), developed by Lloyd Thacker of the Education Conservancy, was sent to college and university presidents in the United States in May 2007 concerning the U.S. News and World Report college rankings. The letter does not ask for a full boycott but rather: Instead, it asks presidents not to participate in the "reputational survey" portion of the overall survey (this section accounts for 25% of the total rank and asks college presidents to give their subjective opinion of other colleges). The letter also asks presidents not to use the rankings as a form of publicity: The letter currently has sixty-one signatures. Twelve college  and university presidents originally signed the letter in early May, 2007.  A number of signatures have been added to the original twelve. Others may be added at a later date.
