Cambridge Assessment Admissions Testing (formerly the Admissions Testing Service) supports educational institutions, professional organisations, governments and employers in the selection and recruitment of applicants, by providing admissions tests for medicine and healthcare, assessments in thinking skills and behavioural styles, and subject-specific admissions tests.  It is part of Cambridge Assessment, a not-for-profit department of the University of Cambridge, England. The Thinking Skills Assessment (TSA) was introduced in 2001 for entry to a range of undergraduate courses at the University of Cambridge.  In 2004, a dedicated unit was formally set up within Cambridge Assessment, with responsibility for developing and administering admissions tests. The Thinking Skills Admissions Testing (TSAT) unit was responsible for administering the Thinking Skills Assessment (TSA) and the first BioMedical Admissions Test (BMAT), which had been introduced in 2003. In 2004, interest in fair admissions to higher education was fuelled by the Schwartz Report. This led to a collaboration between TSAT and the Australian Council for Educational Research (ACER) and the development of uniTEST. uniTEST explored whether a single test could be used for admission to a broad range of courses and higher education institutions. uniTEST was introduced by some Australian universities, but there was relatively little demand in the UK. Other projects followed, including work with the Faculty of English at the University of Oxford to develop an admissions test for undergraduate courses in English. Following a successful trial in autumn 2006, the English Literature Admissions Test (ELAT) was introduced in the 2007â€“08 admissions cycle. In recent years there has been more work with the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge to administer their own admissions tests/pre-interview assessments. This has included: After becoming the Admissions Testing Service in 2011, the name changed to Cambridge Assessment Admissions Testing in January 2017, making clear it is part of Cambridge Assessment, a not-for-profit department of the University of Cambridge. BMAT is used by universities in the UK and overseas for entry to Medicine, Biomedical Science and Dentistry courses.  IMAT is used by a number of Italian universities for entry to English language-taught Medicine, Surgery and related degree courses. The test was developed in conjunction with the Italian Ministry of Education. It is currently taken in September for admission in October. ELAT is used for entry to English Literature courses at the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge. It is taken in late October/early November for admission the following October.  STEP is used for entry to Mathematics courses at the University of Cambridge and the University of Warwick. It is used by the University of Cambridge as the basis for conditional offers, and is taken in June for admission in October. Other UK universities may take STEP results into account when making offers for their Mathematics courses.  The Test of Mathematics for University Admission is a 2-hour 30-minute test of mathematical thinking and reasoning. Durham University, Lancaster University, the University of Warwick, the University of Sheffield and the University of Southampton encourage applicants to their Mathematics courses to take the test. The University of Cambridge Cambridge Assessment Admissions Testing delivers pre-interview assessments for the following University of Cambridge courses: The University of Oxford Cambridge Assessment Admissions Testing administers the following admissions tests for the University of Oxford: TSA is used for entry to a wide range of undergraduate university courses, including: Economics and Management, Engineering, European Social and Political Studies (ESPS), Land Economy, Human Sciences, Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE), Psychology and Philosophy. It assesses whether applicants have the critical thinking and problem-solving skills which universities consider to be essential for success in higher education. In the UK, it is used by the University of Cambridge, University of Oxford and University College London (UCL). It is also used by Stockholm School of Economics, Sweden and Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS (UTP), Malaysia.  CPSQ is designed to assess behavioural styles, specifically focusing on how people approach tasks and interact with others. This includes key areas such as thinking and learning, motivation, self-management, resilience and interpersonal values and attitudes. CPSQ has been specifically created for use within two areas: healthcare education and employment, higher education and schools. The assessment was developed over four years of research and trialling with general and vocational higher education (including medicine, nursing and healthcare institutions).  Cambridge Assessment Admissions Testing conducts a broad programme of research to ensure the fairness and validity of its admissions tests for university admissions. The key aim of the research activity is to gather evidence to demonstrate that the admissions tests make a useful contribution to the admissions process.
