A varsity novel is a novel whose main action is set in and around the campus of a university and focuses on students rather than faculty. Examples include Evelyn Waugh's Brideshead Revisited, Donna Tartt's The Secret History, Tom Sharpe's Porterhouse Blue and Stephen Fry's The Liar and Making History. Novels that focus on faculty rather than students are often considered to belong to a distinct genre, termed campus novels.
