 iSpring Suite is a rapid learning authoring toolkit produced by iSpring for developing training  courses in PowerPoint with embedded (or standalone) quizzes, surveys, and interactions. Its output is compatible with mainstream LMS standards (SCORM/AICC  ), and there is also an option to publish courses specially for BlackBoard LMS. The new xAPI (Tin Can) format for LRSes is supported as well.  Output can be a solid  SWF file(s),  EXE file, HTML page or ZIP archive. Additionally, the cross-platform output format (Flash + HTML5) allows published content to be viewed on any type of modern device. In 2005, Flashspring Pro, the prototype of all iSpring products, was released. It was a simple PowerPoint-to-Flash converter with free and commercial versions. Later, iSpring released Flashspring Ultra and SCORM compatibility became available. The companion products FlashSpring Lite and FlashSpring Server were released in 2006 and 2007, respectively. In 2008 the name was changed to iSpring.    The current version of iSpring Suite, iSpring Suite 9.0, came out in April 24th, 2018.  One enhancement made to iSpring Suite 7 was the support of combined, cross-platform Flash + HTML5 format. It allowed users to create mobile-ready projects that adapt to any screen size and orientation. iSpring Suite 7 came with free mobile apps for iOS  and Android,  which allow offline content viewing. The apps collect statistics on learning activity even with no Internet connection and send them to an LMS once the connection is restored. iSpring Suite 8 introduces several new features to the toolkit.  In version 8, a conversation simulator was added, allowing users to create simulated dialogues. Also, iSpring Suite 8 has a screen recording tool, allowing users to capture the screen and insert the recording on a PowerPoint slide, an audio/video editor both for screen recordings and audio/video narrations, and a video lecture player to show PowerPoint slides and lecture video side by side. Released in April 2018, the 9th version introduced 14 new interactions, a new built-in video editor with extended capabilities for screen recording, and major improvements of the quiz editor: the new drag-and-drop question, the new built-in equation editor, extended feedback options, and 7 new survey question templates.  iSpring Suite includes 5 authoring components: the iSpring add-in, iSpring QuizMaker, conversation simulator, screen recording tool and iSpring Visuals â€” a set of standalone tools that can be used both separately and together. Additional components available in the publishing interface are PowerPoint-to-Video/YouTube (available separately as iSpring SlideAlloy), and iSpring Cloud hosting and sharing platform. iSpring Converter Pro turns PowerPoint projects into mobile-ready online presentations. It supports the standard PowerPoint features such as animation, transition effects and narration facilities  and contains additional features that aren't provided by PowerPoint, such as publishing to the Web or an LMS.  iSpring QuizMaker allows users to create quizzes and surveys. iSpring Visuals adds rich media interactions to PowerPoint presentations. iSpring TalkMaster is a conversation simulator that allows users to create simulated dialogues for customer support training and other purposes. iSpring ScreenRecorder allows users to capture all or part of a screen and insert the recording on a PowerPoint slide, save it to MP4 video, or publish it to a YouTube account. iSpring SlideAlloy converts PowerPoint presentations to videos in .mp4 format, or publishes them to YouTube. iSpring Cloud is a hosting and delivery platform for PowerPoint presentations, Microsoft documents and spreadsheets, images, video, audio, and PDF files.
