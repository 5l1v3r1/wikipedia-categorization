A <a href=\"/wiki/Master_craftsman\" title=\"Master craftsman\">master craftsman</a> was entitled to employ young people as an inexpensive form of labour in exchange for providing food, lodging and formal training in the craft.

They cover all industry sectors in Australia and are used to achieve both 'entry-level' and career 'upskilling' objectives. There were 475,000 Australian Apprentices in-training as at 31 March 2012, an increase of 2.4% from the previous year. Australian Government employer and employee incentives may be applicable, while State and Territory Governments may provide public funding support for the training element of the initiative. Australian Apprenticeships combine time at work with formal training and can be full-time, part-time or school-based.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Australian Apprentice and Traineeship services are dedicated to promoting retention, therefore much effort is made to match applicants with the right apprenticeship or traineeship. This is done with the aid of aptitude tests, tips, and information on 'how to retain an apprentice or apprenticeship'.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Information and resources on potential apprenticeship and traineeship occupations are available in over sixty industries.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The distinction between the terms apprentices and trainees lies mainly around traditional trades and the time it takes to gain a qualification. The Australian government uses Australian Apprenticeships Centres to administer and facilitate Australian Apprenticeships so that funding can be disseminated to eligible businesses and apprentices and trainees and to support the whole process as it underpins the future skills of Australian industry. Australia also has a fairly unusual safety net in place for businesses and Australian Apprentices with its Group Training scheme. This is where businesses that are not able to employ the Australian Apprentice for the full period until they qualify, are able to lease or hire the Australian Apprentice from a Group Training Organisation. It is a safety net, because the Group Training Organisation is the employer and provides continuity of employment and training for the Australian Apprentice.<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In addition to a safety net, Group Training Organisations (GTO) have other benefits such as additional support for both the Host employer and the trainee/apprentice through an industry consultant who visits regularly to make sure that the trainee/apprentice are fulfilling their work and training obligations with their Host employer. There is the additional benefit of the trainee/apprentice being employed by the GTO reducing the Payroll/Superannuation and other legislative requirements on the Host employer who pays as invoiced per agreement.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources.

Apprentices spend about 30\u201360% of their time in companies (soci\u00e1ln\u00ed partne\u0159i \u0161koly) and the rest in formal education.

From 1919, young people had to take 150 hours of theory and general lessons in their subject a year. This minimum training time rose to 360 hours a year in 1961, then 400 in 1986.\n</p><p>The first training centres for apprentices (<i>centres de formation d'apprentis</i>, CFAs) appeared in 1961, and in 1971 apprenticeships were legally made part of professional training. In 1986 the age limit for beginning an apprenticeship was raised from 20 to 25. From 1987 the range of qualifications achieveable through an apprenticeship was widened to include the <i>brevet professionnel</i> (certificate of vocational aptitude), the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Baccalaur%C3%A9at\" title=\"Baccalaur\u00e9at\">bac</a> professionnel</i> (vocational baccalaureate diploma), the <i>brevet de technicien sup\u00e9rieur</i> (advanced technician's certificate), engineering diplomas, master's degree and more.\n</p><p>On January 18, 2005, President <a href=\"/wiki/Jacques_Chirac\" title=\"Jacques Chirac\">Jacques Chirac</a> announced the introduction of a law on a programme for social cohesion comprising the three pillars of employment, housing and equal opportunities. The French government pledged to further develop apprenticeship as a path to success at school and to employment, based on its success: in 2005, 80% of young French people who had completed an apprenticeship entered employment. In France, the term apprenticeship often denotes manual labor but it also includes other jobs like secretary, manager, engineer, shop assistant... The plan aimed to raise the number of apprentices from 365,000 in 2005 to 500,000 in 2009. To achieve this aim, the government is, for example, granting tax relief for companies when they take on apprentices. (Since 1925 a tax has been levied to pay for apprenticeships.) The minister in charge of the campaign, <a href=\"/wiki/Jean-Louis_Borloo\" title=\"Jean-Louis Borloo\">Jean-Louis Borloo</a>, also hoped to improve the image of apprenticeships with an information campaign, as they are often connected with academic failure at school and an ability to grasp only practical skills and not theory. After the <a href=\"/wiki/2005_civil_unrest_in_France\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"2005 civil unrest in France\">civil unrest end of 2005</a>, the government, led by prime minister <a href=\"/wiki/Dominique_de_Villepin\" title=\"Dominique de Villepin\">Dominique de Villepin</a>, announced a new law. Dubbed \"law on equality of chances\", it created the <a href=\"/wiki/First_Employment_Contract\" title=\"First Employment Contract\">First Employment Contract</a> as well as manual apprenticeship from as early as 14 years of age. From this age, students are allowed to quit the compulsory school system in order to quickly learn a vocation.

An apprenticeship takes between 2.5 and 3.5 years. Originally, at the beginning of the 20th century, less than 1% of German students attended the Gymnasium (the 8\u20139 year university-preparatory school) to obtain the Abitur graduation which was the only way to university back then. In the 1950s still only 5% of German youngsters entered university and in 1960 only 6% did.

During the programme it is not allowed to assign the apprentice to regular employment and he is well protected from abrupt dismissal until the programme ends.

Each profession takes a different time, usually between 24 and 36 months.\n</p><p>Thus, everyone who had completed an apprenticeship e.g., as an industrial manager (<i>Industriekaufmann</i>) has learned the same skills and has attended the same courses in <a href=\"/wiki/Procurement\" title=\"Procurement\">procurement</a> and stocking up, <a href=\"/wiki/Control_(management)\" title=\"Control (management)\">controlling</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Human_resources\" title=\"Human resources\">staffing</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Accounting\" title=\"Accounting\">accounting</a> procedures, <a href=\"/wiki/Production_planning\" title=\"Production planning\">production planning</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Terms_of_trade\" title=\"Terms of trade\">terms of trade</a> and transport <a href=\"/wiki/Logistics\" title=\"Logistics\">logistics</a> and various other subjects.\nSomeone who has not taken this apprenticeship or did not pass the final examinations at the chamber of industry and commerce is not allowed to call himself an <i>Industriekaufmann</i>.

An 'usta' is eligible to take in and accept new 'ciraks' to train and bring them up. The training process usually starts when the small boy is of age 10\u201311 and becomes a full-grown master at the age of 20\u201325. Many years of hard work and disciplining under the authority of the master is the key to the young apprentice's education and learning process.\n</p><p>In Turkey today there are many vocational schools that train children to gain skills to learn a new profession.

The parents or guardians of a minor would agree with a <a href=\"/wiki/Master_craftsman\" title=\"Master craftsman\">master craftsman</a> or tradesman the conditions for an apprenticeship. This contract would then bind the youth for 5\u20139 years (e.g., from age 14 to 21). Apprentice's families would sometimes pay a \"premium\" or fee to the craftsman and the contract would usually be recorded in a written <a href=\"/wiki/Indenture\" title=\"Indenture\">indenture</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Aldrich1997_19-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Aldrich1997-19\">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup>  Modern apprenticeships range from craft to high status in professional practice in engineering, law, accounting, architecture, management consulting, and others.\n</p><p>In towns and cities with guilds, apprenticeship would often be subject to guild regulation, setting minimum terms of service, or limiting the number of apprentices that a master could train at any one time.<sup id=\"cite_ref-20\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-20\">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup> Guilds also often kept records of who became an apprentice, and this would often provide a qualification for later becoming a freeman of a guild or a citizen of a city.<sup id=\"cite_ref-21\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-21\">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup> Many youths would train in villages or communities that lacked guilds, however, so avoiding the impact of these regulations.\n</p><p>In the 16th century, the payment of a \"premium\" to the master was not at all common, but such fees became relatively common by the end of the 17th century, though they varied greatly from trade to trade. The payment of a one-off fee could be very difficult for some parents, limiting who was able to undertake apprenticeships. In the 18th-century, apprenticeship premiums were taxed, and the registers of the Stamp Duty that recorded tax payments mostly survive, showing that roughly one in ten teenage males served an apprenticeship for which they paid fees, and that the majority paid five to ten pounds to their master.<sup id=\"cite_ref-22\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-22\">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In theory no wage had to be paid to an apprentice since the technical training was provided in return for the labour given, and wages were illegal in some cities, such as London. However, it was usual to pay small sums to apprentices, sometimes with which to buy, or instead of, new clothes. By the 18th century regular payments, at least in the last two or three years of the apprentice's term, became usual and those who lived apart from their masters were frequently paid a regular wage. This was sometimes called the \"half-pay\" system or \"colting\", payments being made weekly or monthly to the apprentice or to his parents. In these cases, the apprentice often went home from Saturday night to Monday morning. This was the norm in the 19th century but this system had existed in some trades since the 16th century.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Apprenticeship_in_England_23-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Apprenticeship_in_England-23\">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In 1563, the <a href=\"/wiki/Statute_of_Artificers_1562\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Statute of Artificers 1562\">Statute of Artificers and Apprentices</a> was passed to regulate and protect the apprenticeship system, forbidding anyone from practising a trade or craft without first serving a 7-year period as an apprentice to a master<sup id=\"cite_ref-NA_FamilyHistory_24-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-NA_FamilyHistory-24\">&#91;24&#93;</a></sup> (though in practice Freemen's sons could negotiate shorter terms).<sup id=\"cite_ref-Dunlop1912_25-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Dunlop1912-25\">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>From 1601, '<a href=\"/wiki/Parish\" title=\"Parish\">parish</a>' apprenticeships under the <a href=\"/wiki/Elizabethan_Poor_Law_(1601)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Elizabethan Poor Law (1601)\">Elizabethan Poor Law</a> came to be used as a way of providing for poor, illegitimate and orphaned children of both sexes alongside the regular system of skilled apprenticeships, which tended to provide for boys from slightly more affluent backgrounds.

The aims were to ensure an adequate supply of training at all levels; to improve the quality and quantity of training; and to share the costs of training among employers. The ITBs were empowered to publish training recommendations, which contained full details of the tasks to be learned, the syllabus to be followed, the standards to be reached and vocational courses to be followed. These were often accompanied by training manuals, which were in effect practitioners' guides to apprentice training, and some ITBs provide training in their own centres. The ITBs did much to formalise what could have been a haphazard training experience and greatly improved its quality. The years from the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s saw the highest levels of apprentice recruitment, yet even so, out of a school leaving cohort of about 750,000, only about 110,000 (mostly boys) became apprentices. The apprenticeship system aimed at highly developed craft and higher technician skills for an elite minority of the workforce, the majority of whom were trained in industries that declined rapidly from 1973 onwards, and by the 1980s it was clear that in manufacturing this decline was permanent.<sup id=\"cite_ref-27\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-27\">&#91;27&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Since the 1950s, the UK high technology industry (Aerospace, Nuclear, Oil &amp; Gas, Automotive, Telecommunications, Power Generation and Distribution etc.) trained its higher technicians and professional engineers via the traditional indentured apprenticeship system of learning \u2013 usually a 4\u20136 year process from age 16\u201321. There were 4 types of traditional apprenticeship: craft, technician, higher technician, and graduate.  Craft, technician and higher technician apprenticeships usually took 4 to 5 years while a graduate apprenticeship was a short 2-year experience usually while at university or post graduate experience.  Non-graduate technician apprenticeships were often referred to as \"technical apprenticeships\". The traditional apprenticeship framework in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s was designed to allow young people (from 16 years old) an alternative path to A Levels to achieve both an academic qualification (equivalent to today's level 4 or 5 NVQs) and competency-based skills for <a href=\"/wiki/Knowledge_worker\" title=\"Knowledge worker\">knowledge work</a>. Often referred to as the \"Golden Age\" of work and employment for bright young people, the traditional technical apprenticeship framework was open to young people who had a minimum of 4 O Levels to enroll in an Ordinary National Certificate or Diploma (ONC, OND) or a City &amp; Guilds engineering technician course. Apprentices could progress to the <a href=\"/wiki/Higher_National_Certificate\" title=\"Higher National Certificate\">Higher National Certificate</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Higher_National_Diploma\" title=\"Higher National Diploma\">Higher National Diploma</a> (HNC, HND) or advanced <a href=\"/wiki/City_and_Guilds\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"City and Guilds\">City and Guilds</a> course such as Full Technological Certification. Apprenticeship positions at elite companies often had hundreds of applications for a placement. Academic learning during an apprenticeship was achieved either via block release or day release at a local technical institute. An OND or HND was usually obtained via the block release approach whereby an apprentice would be released for periods of up to 3 months to study academic courses full-time and then return to the employer for applied work experience. For entrance into the higher technical engineering apprenticeships, O Levels had to include Mathematics, Physics, and English language. The academic level of subjects such as mathematics, physics, chemistry on ONC/OND, and some City &amp; Guilds advanced technician courses, was equivalent to A level mathematics, physics and chemistry. The academic science subjects were based on applied science in subjects such as thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, mechanics of machines, dynamics and statics, electrical science and electronics.  These are often referred to as the engineering sciences. HNC and HND were broadly equivalent to subjects in the first year of a bachelor's degree in engineering but not studied to the same intensity or mathematical depth. HNC was accepted as entrance into the first year of an engineering degree and high performance on an HND course could allow a student direct entry into the second year of a degree.  Few apprentices followed this path since it would have meant 10\u201312 years in further and higher education. For the few that did follow this path they accomplished a solid foundation of competency-based work training via apprenticeship and attained a higher academic qualification at a university or Polytechnic combining both forms of education; vocational plus academic. During the 1970s, City and Guilds assumed responsibility for the administration of HNC and HND courses.\n</p><p>The <a href=\"/wiki/City_and_Guilds_of_London_Institute\" title=\"City and Guilds of London Institute\">City and Guilds of London Institute</a> the forerunner of <a href=\"/wiki/Imperial_College\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Imperial College\">Imperial College</a> engineering school has been offering vocational education through apprenticeships since the 1870s from basic craft skills (mechanic, hairdresser, chef, plumbing, carpentry, bricklaying, etc.) all the way up to qualifications equivalent to university master's degrees and doctorates. The City and Guilds diploma of fellowship is awarded to individuals who are nationally recognised through peer review as having achieved the very highest level in competency-based achievement. The first award of FCGI was approved by Council in December 1892 and awarded in 1893 to Mr H A Humphrey, Engineering Manager of the Refined Bicarbonate and Crystal Plant Departments of <a href=\"/wiki/Brunner_Mond\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Brunner Mond\">Brunner, Mond &amp; Co</a>. His award was for material improvements in the manufacture of bicarbonate of soda. The system of nomination was administered within Imperial College, with recommendations being passed to the Council of the Institute for approval. About 500\u2013600 people have been awarded Fellowship.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Traditional_framework\">Traditional framework</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Apprenticeship&amp;action=edit&amp;section=25\" title=\"Edit section: Traditional framework\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>The traditional apprenticeship framework's purpose was to provide a supply of young people seeking to enter work-based learning via apprenticeships by offering structured high-value learning and transferable skills and knowledge. Apprenticeship training was enabled by linking industry with local technical colleges and professional engineering institutions. The apprenticeship framework offered a clear pathway and competency outcomes that addressed the issues facing the industry sector and specific companies. This system was in place since the 1950s. The system provided young people with an alternative to staying in full-time education post- 16/18 to gain purely academic qualifications without work-based learning. The apprenticeship system of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s provided the necessary preparation for young people to qualify as a Craft trade (Machinist, Toolmaker, Fitter, Plumber, Welder, Mechanic, Millwright etc.), or Technician (quality inspector, draughtsman, designer, planner, work study, programmer), or Technician Engineer (tool design, product design, methods, stress and structural analysis, machine design etc.) and enabled a path to a fully qualified Chartered Engineer in a specific discipline (Mechanical, Electrical, Civil, Aeronautical, Chemical, Building, Structural, Manufacturing etc.). The Chartered Engineer qualification was usually achieved aged 28 and above.  Apprentices undertook a variety of job roles in numerous shop floor and office technical functions to assist the work of master craftsmen, technicians, engineers, and managers in the design, development, manufacture and maintenance of products and production systems.\n</p><p>It was possible for apprentices to progress from national certificates and diplomas to engineering degrees if they had the aptitude.<sup id=\"cite_ref-28\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-28\">&#91;28&#93;</a></sup> The system allowed young people to find their level and still achieve milestones along the path from apprenticeship into higher education via a polytechnic or university. Though rare, it was possible for an apprentice to advance from vocational studies, to undergraduate degree, to graduate study and earn a master's degree or a PhD. The system was effective; industry was assured of a supply of practically educated and work-skilled staff, local technical colleges offered industry relevant courses that had a high measure of academic content and an apprentice was prepared for professional life or higher education by the age of 21. With the exception of advanced technology companies particularly in aerospace (BAE systems, Rolls-Royce, Bombardier) this system declined with the decline of general manufacturing industry in the UK.\n</p><p>Traditional apprenticeships reached their lowest point in the 1980s: by that time, training programmes declined.  The exception to this was in the high technology engineering areas of aerospace, chemicals, nuclear, automotive, power and energy systems where apprentices continued to served the structured four- to five-year programmes of both practical and academic study to qualify as <a href=\"/wiki/Engineering_technician\" title=\"Engineering technician\">engineering technician</a> or Incorporate Engineer (<a href=\"/wiki/Engineering_technologist\" title=\"Engineering technologist\">engineering technologist</a>) and go on to earn a master of engineering degree and qualify as a <a href=\"/wiki/Chartered_Engineer_(UK)\" title=\"Chartered Engineer (UK)\">Chartered Engineer (UK)</a>; the UK gold standard engineering qualification.  Engineering technicians and technologists undertook combined theory and practice typically for example at a technical college for one day and two evenings per week on a <a href=\"/wiki/City_%26_Guilds\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"City &amp; Guilds\">City &amp; Guilds</a> programme or <a href=\"/wiki/Ordinary_National_Certificate\" title=\"Ordinary National Certificate\">Ordinary National Certificate</a> / <a href=\"/wiki/Higher_National_Certificate\" title=\"Higher National Certificate\">Higher National Certificate</a> course. Becoming a chartered engineer via the apprenticeship route normally involved 10 \u2013 12 years of academic and vocational training at a combination of an employer, college of further education and/or university.

There are three levels of apprenticeship available spanning 2\u20136 years of progression. It is possible for ambitious apprentices to progress from level 2 (intermediate) to level 7 ( master's degree) over many years of training and education. Learners start at a level which reflects their current qualifications and the opportunities available in the sector of interest:\n</p><p><b>Intermediate Apprenticeship (Level 2; equivalent to five good GCSE passes)</b>: provides learners with the skills and qualifications for their chosen career and allow entry (if desired) to an Advanced Apprenticeship.

They seek to link academic education to careers. Some programs include <a href=\"/wiki/Job_shadowing\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Job shadowing\">job shadowing</a>, watching a real worker for a short period of time, or actually spending significant time at a job at no or reduced pay that would otherwise be spent in academic classes or working at a local business.

American high schools were introduced in the early 20th century to educate students of all ability and interests in one learning community rather than prepare a small number for college. Traditionally, American students are tracked within a wide choice of courses based on ability, with vocational courses (such as auto repair and carpentry) tending to be at the lower end of academic ability and trigonometry and pre-calculus at the upper end.\n</p><p>American education reformers have sought to end such <a href=\"/wiki/Tracking_(education)\" title=\"Tracking (education)\">tracking</a>, which is seen as a barrier to opportunity. By contrast, the system studied by the <a href=\"/wiki/NCEE\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"NCEE\">NCEE</a> (National Center on Education and the Economy) actually relies much more heavily on tracking. Education officials in the U.S., based largely on school redesign proposals by NCEE and other organizations, have chosen to use <a href=\"/wiki/Criterion-referenced_test\" title=\"Criterion-referenced test\">criterion-referenced tests</a> that define one high standard that must be achieved by all students to receive a uniform diploma. American education policy under the \"<a href=\"/wiki/No_Child_Left_Behind_Act\" title=\"No Child Left Behind Act\">No Child Left Behind Act</a>\" has as an official goal the elimination of the <a href=\"/wiki/Achievement_gap\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Achievement gap\">achievement gap</a> between populations.

In states such as Washington, critics have questioned whether this ensures success for all or just creates massive failure (as only half of all 10th graders have demonstrated they can meet the standards).<sup id=\"cite_ref-44\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-44\">&#91;44&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The construction industry is perhaps the heaviest user of apprenticeship programs in the United States, with the US Department of Labor reporting 74,164 new apprentices accepted in 2007 at the height of the construction boom.

All such incorporations were anciently called universities, which indeed is the proper Latin name for any incorporation whatever. The university of smiths, the university of tailors, etc., are expressions which we commonly meet with in the old charters of ancient towns [...] As to have wrought seven years under a master properly qualified was necessary in order to entitle any person to become a master, and to have himself apprenticed in a common trade; so to have studied seven years under a master properly qualified was necessary to entitle him to become a master, teacher, or doctor (words anciently synonymous) in the liberal arts, and to have scholars or apprentices (words likewise originally synonymous) to study under him.<sup id=\"cite_ref-48\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-48\">&#91;48&#93;</a></sup>\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Also similar to apprenticeships are the <a href=\"/wiki/Professional_development\" title=\"Professional development\">professional development</a> arrangements for new graduates in the professions of <a href=\"/wiki/Accountancy\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Accountancy\">accountancy</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Chartered_Engineer\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Chartered Engineer\">engineering</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Management_consulting\" title=\"Management consulting\">management consulting</a>, and the <a href=\"/wiki/Solicitors\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Solicitors\">law</a>.
