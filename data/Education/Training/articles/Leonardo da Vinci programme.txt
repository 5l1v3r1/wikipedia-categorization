 The Leonardo da Vinci programme is a European Commission funding programme focused on the teaching and training needs of those involved in vocational education and training (VET). The programme is part of the European Commission's Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013  and aims to build a skilled and mobile workforce across Europe. The programme aims to enhance the competitiveness of the European labour market by helping European citizens to acquire new skills, knowledge and qualifications and have them recognised across borders. It also supports innovations and improvements in vocational education and training systems and practices.  The programme funds a wide range of actions, including transnational mobility and European projects focusing on the development or the transfer of innovation and networks. All of the projects funded by the Leonardo da Vinci programme involve working with European partners. The programme addresses trainees in initial vocational training, people on the labour market and professionals in vocational education and training, as well as any organisation active in this field. The Leonardo da Vinci programme was started in 1995.  In 1998 the whistleblowing of Paul van Buitenen criticised misdirection of funds in the EU, particularly in the Leonardo da Vinci programme. A second, broader phase (Leonardo II 2000–2006) concentrated on skills and employability of young people. Of the 21,000 projects financed in this phase, 19,000 had to do with mobility, supporting 367,000 individuals. The budget was €1.45 billion. Phase II was evaluated for the Directorate General for Education and Culture of the European Commission in 2008.  In 2007 a new programme was started, to run until 2013.
