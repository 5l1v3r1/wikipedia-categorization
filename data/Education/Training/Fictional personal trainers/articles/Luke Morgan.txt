Luke Morgan is a fictional character from the British Channel 4 soap opera Hollyoaks, played by Gary Lucy. He was introduced by the show's creator Phil Redmond as part of the Morgan family, and made his first on-screen appearance on 7 June 1999. The character was involved in a male rape storyline, which was branded "groundbreaking" and met with controversy. Lucy opted to leave the role in 2001 after two years, although he returned for two episodes in August 2002. The character's reintroduction was announced on 21 May 2017 and he returned on 24 July. Lucy took a break from the series in 2018 to appear in a play. The Mirror described him as "sullen face but loveable".  Luke has been described as a "heart-throb" and a "hunk" by the Daily Record.   Luke was bullied by Mark Gibbs and his friends for a while due to a football team rivalry. When Luke finally stood up to him Mark was incensed and he and his friends beat Luke up badly. When Luke tried to fight back Mark lost control and raped Luke to belittle and devastate him. Hollyoaks creator Phil Redmond defended criticism and said the storyline "aimed to tackle one of the last great social taboos responsibly".  In the lead up to the attack producers worked closely with rape-related support groups to help make the storyline as realistic as possible.  On the storyline Lucy said "When they first told me about the storyline I was dubious as to whether or not I should take it. Firstly because I was so young and secondly it hadn't been touched before so no-one knew how the public and press would take it. After thinking about it and doing research behind it I thought it was definitely a subject worth approaching. So we did it and reaped the rewards. I feel very lucky."  On why she wanted to tackle the subject series producer Jo Hallows said "The message is about banishing taboos - telling people it's OK to talk and there are people who can help. If this episode helps one person it will have been a worthwhile exercise."  Keith Greenaway, coordinator of Central Birmingham Victim Support welcomed the decision saying "we can show victims it is not something to be ashamed of and it wasn't their fault".  Following the end of the storyline, Luke began to struggle with depression, which led to the character attempting suicide.  On 21 May 2017, it was reported by Ed Gleave of The Daily Star that Lucy had agreed to reprise the role after an absence of fifteen years and had signed an eighteen-month contract.  The longer contract allowed producers to create "some really meaty storylines" for the character, which would place him at "the centre of the action."  Lucy began filming in May 2017.  A show spokesperson confirmed the news to Digital Spy but refused to comment any further.  Sarah James (Digital Spy) praised the news and said she was looking forward to his return.  â€”Gary Lucy on how Luke acts upon his return.
