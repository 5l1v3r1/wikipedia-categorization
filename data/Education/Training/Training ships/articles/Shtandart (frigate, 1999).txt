The frigate Shtandart (Russian: Штандартъ) is modern replica of the first ship of Russia's Baltic fleet, was launched in 1703 at the Olonetsky shipyard near Olonets by the decree of Tsar Peter I and orders issued by commander Aleksandr Menshikov. The name Shtandart was also given to the royal yachts of the tsars until the Russian Revolution in 1917. Tsar Nicholas II's royal yacht was last of this series. In 1994 a small group of sailing enthusiasts led by Vladimir Martus started construction of a replica of the historical ship.  Martus developed a new layout of the Shtandart wherein she was built with four bulkheads, dividing her into five compartments.  The replica frigate has three masts and her displacement is 220 tons. She is 25.88 metres (82.0 ft) registered length, 27.5 metres (90 ft) long on deck and 34.5 metres (113 ft) long overall. The Shtandart is 7.0 metres (23 ft) wide with a draft of 3.0 to 3.3 metres (11 ft). The ship is designed for speeds between 8-9 knots under sail, and under auxiliary engines she can make up to 13 knots (25 km/h). The original crew complement in 1703 was between 120 and 150, and the modern crew consists of 30 trainees and 10 officers. The "Shtandart Project" (a non-commercial organisation dedicated to youth development) launched a replica of the frigate on September 4, 1999. The modern Shtandart has two zones: Beginning in 2007, all sailing vessels in Russia faced challenges with a certification.  The new National Sea and River Authority (then Росморречнадзор/Rosmorrechnadzor, now Госморречнадзор/Gosmorrechnadzor) refused to issue certificates for sailing ships. The Shtandart was one of the most prominent of these vessels, so her dispute with this government agency was widely publicized.  The Northwest directorate of the Rosmorrechnadzor cancelled the Shtandart's certifications but the St. Petersburg Arbitration Court reversed the decision in favor of the frigate, and the certificate's cancellation was ruled illegal.   The ship has now been sailing around in Europe for the last ten years. It is not known when she could return to her home port. List of Russian sail frigates
