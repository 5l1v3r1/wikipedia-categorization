Belle Poule is a French naval schooner used as a training vessel.  She was launched on 8 February 1932 at the Chantiers de Normandie at Fecamp.  She is a replica of a type of fishing vessel that was used until 1935 off Iceland for catching cod.  She has a sister ship, Étoile. In 1940 she fled to the United Kingdom and in July was seized by the British. Both Étoile and Belle Poule then served  the Free French Forces during the Second World War, Belle Poule as an annex.  In recognition of their loyalty to the Free French they received the honour of the right to fly the French flag with the cross of Lorraine. In 1945 she returned to Brest. Since 13 May 1978 Belle Poule has been sponsored by the city of Pauillac.
