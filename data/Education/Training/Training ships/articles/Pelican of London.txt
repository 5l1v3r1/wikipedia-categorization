  Pelican of London is a sail training ship based in the United Kingdom. Built in 1948 as Pelican she served as an Arctic trawler and then coastal trading vessel named Kadett until 1995. In 2007 the ship was completed after many years of being re-built as a sail-training ship.  Built in 1948 in Le Havre, France, Pelican was originally a double-beam Arctic fishing trawler,  one of five identical ships built in Chantiers et Ateliers, the shipyard once owned by the shipbuilder Augustin Normand. She was sold to a Norwegian firm and spent the next 19 years fishing the Arctic. In 1968 Pelican was reclassified from a trawler to a coaster. Her owners renamed her Kadett. She remained Kadett for 27 years until in 1995 she again changed hands. She was bought by ex-Naval Commander Graham Neilson who transformed her into a tall ship and renamed her Pelican of London. He had already undertaken a similar project with the TS Astrid. Working in Portland Harbour, Dorset, UK, Neilson and his team spent 12 years stripping back the trawler and rebuilding her as a main mast barquentine.  A moderate rearrangement of the mainmast standing rigging enables the yards to be braced to half the traditional angle when on the wind, giving the ship unusual windward ability for a square rigger. A trainee on the ship won the 2010 Torbay cup.  As of 2012, Pelican of London is operated as a sail training vessel for young people, by the charity Adventure Under Sail.  Sail Training International ranks it is a Class A tall ship.  In autumn of 2012, Pelican of London was scheduled to become the first sailing ship in a century to make a trans-Atlantic voyage from the Port of Liverpool with fare-paying passengers.  It's not clear if this voyage took place. Pelican has completed a number of transatlantic voyages.  Pelican of London was advertised for sale in 2012, valued at Â£2.45 million.   In June 2015 it was noted as an attendee of Tall Ships Belfast 2015.
