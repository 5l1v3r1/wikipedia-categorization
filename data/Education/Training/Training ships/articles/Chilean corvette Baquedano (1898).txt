Baquedano was the first training ship of the Chilean Navy ordered specifically for this purpose. She replaced in this function the old Abtao and Pilcomayo.  From 1922 to 1926 she was refitted in Talcahuano. She continued to serve as training ship until 1935. Francisco Coloane wrote the novel El Ãºltimo grumete de la Baquedano (The last ship boy of the Baquedano).
