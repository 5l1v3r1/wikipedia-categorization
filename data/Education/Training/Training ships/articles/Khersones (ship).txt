The Khersones or Chersones is a Russian three-mast tall ship, a full rigged ship.  It was built in 1989 in Gdańsk Shipyard, Poland, in a series of six sister ships (among which also the Mir), after the designs of Polish naval architect Zygmunt Choreń. The ship is named after the city of Chersonesus an ancient city and archaeological site near Sevastopol. Today Khersones was a training ship for the Admiral Ushakov Maritime State University. She partakes in many windjammer regattas.  Khersones will take part in "SCF Black Sea Tall Ships Regatta - 2016".
