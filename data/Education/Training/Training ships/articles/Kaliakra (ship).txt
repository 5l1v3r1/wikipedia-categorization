 The Sail Training Vessel Kaliakra (Known also as STV Kaliakra, Bulgarian: Калиакра) is a barquentine, built in 1984 at the Gdańsk Shipyard, after the plans of the Polish technical designer Zygmunt Choreń. She is a property of Bulgarian  Maritime Training Centre and is operated by Navigation Maritime Bulgare, Bulgaria. The ship's home port is Varna, Bulgaria. The general perception is that Kaliakra is a reproduction of a ship of the same name from the time before World War I. In fact, she is one of three modern sister ships designed for training, the other two being STS Pogoria and ORP Iskra. Now she is used for training the Naval Cadets from Nikola Vaptsarov Naval Academy in Varna, Bulgaria. The ship is one of the fastest tall ships in the world.  She has participated on relatively regular basis in the Cutty Sark Tall Ships regatta, organized by the Sail Training International (STI) Association. During the Columbus Race in 1992, dedicated to the 500 years jubilee of the discovery of America, Kaliakra sailed the Atlantic Ocean twice and finished third out of 143 ships. Onboard Kaliakra have been King Juan Carlos of Spain, Crown Prince Haakon of Norway and many other distinguished personalities.  Sail Training journeys are performed, as well as tourist cruises. In 1996 a coin of 1000 leva denomination that featured the ship on its tail was issued. The hull and the superstructure are made of steel; the masts are partly made of steel and partly of fabric.
