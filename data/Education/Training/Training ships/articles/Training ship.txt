A training ship is a ship used to train students as sailors. The term is especially used for ships employed by navies to train future officers.  Essentially there are two types: those used for training at sea and old hulks used to house classrooms. The hands-on aspect provided by sail training has also been used as a platform for everything from semesters at sea for undergraduate oceanography and biology students, marine science and physical science for high school students, and character building for at-risk youths. In the Sea Cadet Corps all Units use a ship prefix "T.S.", followed by the ship's proper name.  For example, the Fishguard Sea Cadets' ship's name is T.S. Skirmisher. The T.S. prefix is used as the Sea Cadets is not part of the Royal Navy, and cannot be prefixed "HMS".  Media related to Training ships at Wikimedia Commons
