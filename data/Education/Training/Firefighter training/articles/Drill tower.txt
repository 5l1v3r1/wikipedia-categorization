A drill tower is a tower and training facility for firefighters. It is usually built within a fire station facility for routine exercises and training.  A drill tower is a multi-level structure simulating high-rise buildings. Heights vary by location. Usually, its height is higher than fire engine ladders can reach.  Levels are accessible from a stairway inside the tower, similar to buildings in urban areas.  Drill towers usually contain windows for practising fire fighting and other rescue exercises.  Towers can help firefighters deal with real-life situations, including running upstairs with heavy equipment, using rope and safety nets, and operating a fire engine in a confined space.
