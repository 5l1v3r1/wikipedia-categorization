{"parse":{"title":"Returned to unit","pageid":11689689,"revid":578489436,"text":{"*":"<div class=\"mw-parser-output\"><p><b>Returned To Unit</b> or <b>RTU</b> refers to a military member being returned to their home base or home unit, either due to their being medically unfit, their requesting to be withdrawn from training, or their being unfit for training or otherwise disorderly. As military members can only be <a href=\"/wiki/Court-martial\" title=\"Court-martial\">court-martialed</a> at their home base or unit, being RTU'd for <a href=\"/wiki/Misconduct\" title=\"Misconduct\">misconduct</a> can often be a precursor to further judicial punishment.\n</p><p>RTU'ing is a concept used during a period of specialist training, whereby a service person has been extracted or detached from their home unit. For example, if a service person has been extracted to complete an instruction course run by a specialist unit within the armed forces such as a <a href=\"/wiki/Physical_Training_Instructor\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Physical Training Instructor\">PTI</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Shooting_range\" title=\"Shooting range\">Range</a> Control course. In the event of the service person wishing to withdraw from the course (e.g. for personal or medical reasons); or if the course <a href=\"/wiki/Supervisor\" title=\"Supervisor\">supervisors</a> deem that the service person is unfit to complete the course, for either medical or disciplinary reasons, the service person may be returned to their home unit. If a candidate is RTU'd, the supervisor responsible for sending them home will supply a written report to the service person's <a href=\"/wiki/Officer_Commanding\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Officer Commanding\">OC</a> detailing the reason why they have been RTU'd. If a service person is RTU'd on disciplinary grounds, their OC will decide if any further disciplinary action is needed, based on the RTU report from the course supervisor, and if necessary, by consultation with the course supervisors. The reason this is done is that, according to military law, disciplinary action such as a <a href=\"/wiki/Court-martial\" title=\"Court-martial\">court-martial</a> can only by issued against a service person by their home unit.\n</p><p>There are several reasons why a military member may be RTU'd. It can be for major or minor infractions of the rules, or disorderly behaviour. It may also be on compassionate grounds, such as RTU'ing an injured soldier (or other medical conditions).\n</p><p>The term <i>Returned To Unit</i> (<i>RTU</i>) is used in the <a href=\"/wiki/Canadian_Forces\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Canadian Forces\">Canadian Forces</a> and the <a href=\"/wiki/UK\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"UK\">UK</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Returned_to_unit&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Military_discipline\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Military discipline\">military discipline</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/List_of_established_military_terms\" title=\"List of established military terms\">List of established military terms</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sources_and_references\">Sources and references</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Returned_to_unit&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Sources and references\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.admfincs.forces.gc.ca/admfincs/subjects/cfao/011-09_e.asp\">[1]</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.specialboatservice.co.uk/sbs-selection.htm\">[2]</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.arrse.co.uk/wiki/RTU\">[3]</a></li></ul>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw1254\nCached time: 20180909103326\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.004 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.009 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 17/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 0/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:11689689-0!canonical and timestamp 20180909103326 and revision id 578489436\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","*":"Military_education_and_training"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Canadian Forces"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Court-martial"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"List of established military terms"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Military discipline"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Misconduct"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Officer Commanding"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Physical Training Instructor"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Shooting range"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Supervisor"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"UK"}],"templates":[],"images":[],"externallinks":["http://www.admfincs.forces.gc.ca/admfincs/subjects/cfao/011-09_e.asp","http://www.specialboatservice.co.uk/sbs-selection.htm","http://www.arrse.co.uk/wiki/RTU"],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"See also","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Returned_to_unit","byteoffset":2057,"anchor":"See_also"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Sources and references","number":"2","index":"2","fromtitle":"Returned_to_unit","byteoffset":2136,"anchor":"Sources_and_references"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Returned to unit","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q17126279"}]}}
