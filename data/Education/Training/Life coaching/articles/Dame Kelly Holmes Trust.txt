The Dame Kelly Holmes Trust is a charity that was set up in 2008 by double Olympic champion Dame Kelly Holmes. It supports retired athletes as they transition from sport, and uses their skills and experience to transform the lives of disadvantaged young people through mentoring programmes. The Dame Kelly Holmes Trust supports disadvantaged young people between the ages of 14 and 25, and works in all regions of the UK. By April 2015, the Dame Kelly Holmes Trust had made an impact on 200,000 young people, and supported over 400 athletes in their transition from sport.  The Trust worked directly with 3,198 young people in its long-term programmes in 2016â€“17, almost three times as many as the previous year.  The Dame Kelly Holmes Trust runs a number of programmes for disadvantaged young people throughout the UK including Get On Track, AQA Unlocking Potential, Sport For Change and Sporting Champions. Young people have been helped by the trust to gain permanent employment despite various difficulties including criminal records, special needs and lack of school qualifications.  Other vulnerable people supported by the Trust in 2016 included people leaving care, and young women at risk of sexual exploitation.  The charity is funded by a combination of grants, trusts, corporate partners and fundraising. The Dame Kelly Holmes Trust has achieved a greater and longer-lasting impact than various other sports stars' foundations in the UK.
