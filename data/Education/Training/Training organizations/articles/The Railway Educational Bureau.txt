Union Pacific's president, Edward Henry Harriman hired D. C. Buell to develop training materials for the railroad. Buell was later appointed the Director of Union Pacific's Educational Bureau of Information. Within a few years Buell and the Union Pacific realized other railroads could benefit by the training programs it developed. The division was spun off as The Railway Educational Bureau and Buell later became the owner.
