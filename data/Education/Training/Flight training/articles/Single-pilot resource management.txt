Single-pilot resource management (SRM) is an adaptation of crew resource management (CRM) training to single-pilot operations. The purpose of SRM is to reduce the number of aviation accidents caused by human error by teaching pilots about their own human limitations and how to maximize their performance. The initiative for this training began in 2005 when the NBAA published training guidelines for single-pilot operations of very light jets (VLJs).  However, the application of SRM is not limited to VLJ pilots. This training applies to all single-pilot flights in general aviation (GA).   In the United States, GA accounts for 96% of aircraft, 60% of flight hours. It also accounts for 94% of fatal aviation accidents,   Airline and military aviation estimates of the number of accidents caused by pilot error range from 70-80%   - these are the statistics that SRM seeks to reduce. The content of SRM is similar to that of CRM training, except the topics relating to pilot crews are excluded (ex. captain and co-pilot communication). Examples of topics included in SRM training are situational awareness, workload management, automation management, and aeronautical decision making.   Delivering this training to GA pilots is difficult as they are spread out throughout the country, unlike airline pilots who can gather at one time in a lecture hall. The University of Western Ontario is a leader in SRM and is researching how to deliver SRM training online. A major research investigation at UWO recently proved that online SRM training improves pilot situational awareness.  This investigation involved 36 licensed pilots completing SRM training followed by a performance evaluation in a high-fidelity Cessna 172 flight simulator.
