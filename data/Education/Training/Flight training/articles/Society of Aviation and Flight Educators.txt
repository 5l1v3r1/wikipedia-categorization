The Society of Aviation and Flight Educators (SAFE) is a professional organization open to all aviation educators, including flight instructors, ground instructors, academicians, and others who have an interest in aviation education. Founded in Connecticut in early 2009, SAFE "facilitates the professional development of aviation educators [and] seeks to create a safer aviation environment through enhanced education."  SAFE is governed by a Board of Directors composed of nine members, all of whom are elected by the SAFE membership. SAFE has signed letters of understanding with a number of organizations, including Cessna Aircraft Company  and the FAA Safety Team.  SAFE is also a sponsor of the General Aviation Awards Program.  The organization is proactive on issues that affect aviation educators   and has partnered with others to develop a mentoring program for aviation educators.  In July 2010, SAFE launched a flight instructor liability insurance program  developed for its member-instructors. In November 2010, SAFE announced plans to chair the GA Pilot Training Reform Symposium.
