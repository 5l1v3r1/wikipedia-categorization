Purportedly civilian in nature, these European government-sponsored programs were, in fact, nothing more than military flight training academies.\n</p><p>In October 1938, <a href=\"/wiki/Henry_H._Arnold\" title=\"Henry H.

President <a href=\"/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt\" title=\"Franklin D. Roosevelt\">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> unveiled the program on December 27, 1938, announcing at a White House press conference that he had signed off on a proposal to provide a needed boost to <a href=\"/wiki/General_aviation\" title=\"General aviation\">general aviation</a> by providing pilot training to 20,000 college students a year.\n</p><p>Following the precedent established by the Europeans, the CPTP was established as a civilian program but its potential for national defense was undisguised. The program started in 1939 with two laws passed by Congress in April and June,<sup id=\"cite_ref-shsu_2-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-shsu-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> with the government paying for a 72-hour <a href=\"/wiki/Ground_school\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Ground school\">ground school</a> course followed by 35 to 50 hours of <a href=\"/wiki/Flight_instruction\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Flight instruction\">flight instruction</a> at facilities located near eleven colleges and universities.  It was an unqualified success and provided a grand vision for its supporters\u2014to greatly expand the nation's civilian pilot population by training thousands of college students to fly.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Controversy\">Controversy</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Civilian_Pilot_Training_Program&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Controversy\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The military establishment was initially unenthusiastic about the CPTP concept, quite unimpressed by any program initiated and administered by civilians.  <a href=\"/wiki/United_States_Congress\" title=\"United States Congress\">Congress</a>, too, was split along mostly party lines as to the value of the CPTP.  <a href=\"/wiki/Isolationists\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Isolationists\">Isolationists</a> branded the program as provocative saber-rattling that threatened the nation's neutrality; others slammed it as a <a href=\"/wiki/Pork_barrel\" title=\"Pork barrel\">pork barrel</a> waste of tax dollars, while supporters touted the positive impacts on the aviation industry and the defense value of a vastly enlarged base of trained pilots.\n</p><p>After the <a href=\"/wiki/Polish_September_Campaign\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Polish September Campaign\">Nazi invasion of Poland</a> on September 1, 1939, triggered World War&#160;II, the military value of the CPTP became obvious, even to the program's detractors.  The United States started to evaluate its ability to fight an air war and the results were appalling. Pilots, <a href=\"/wiki/Flight_instructor\" title=\"Flight instructor\">instructors</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Training_aircraft\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Training aircraft\">training aircraft</a> were all in short supply.  Acknowledging the shortage of trained pilots, both the <a href=\"/wiki/United_States_Army_Air_Corps\" title=\"United States Army Air Corps\">Army Air Corps</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/United_States_Navy\" title=\"United States Navy\">Navy</a> reluctantly waived certain \u201celimination\u201d courses for CPTP graduates and allowed them to proceed directly into pilot training.\n</p><p>The <a href=\"/wiki/United_States_Army_Air_Corps\" title=\"United States Army Air Corps\">Army Air Corps</a> deemed the situation to be so grave it proposed that <a href=\"/wiki/Private_aviation\" title=\"Private aviation\">private aviation</a> be suspended and all pilot training (most notably the CPTP) be brought under the control of the military. The December 13, 1940, issue of <i>American Aviation Daily</i> carried this account of the Army's intentions:\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cPreliminary plans are understood to be already drafted by the Army to ground all private flying in the United States for the duration of the national emergency...The Army will take over all training (including CPTP).\u201d\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Army's proposal met with stiff resistance. Just two weeks after the American Aviation Daily article appeared, 83 companies with a vested interest in general aviation organized the <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=National_Aviation_Training_Association&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"National Aviation Training Association (page does not exist)\">National Aviation Training Association</a> (NATA). NATA members recognized that, if left unchallenged, the Army plan would, for all practical purposes, ban private aircraft from U.S. skies. The NATA and other aviation interests blunted the Army's bid with an effective lobbying campaign in Congress. Their actions not only saved the CPTP, they may have saved the entire general aviation industry in the United States.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Buildup\">Buildup</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Civilian_Pilot_Training_Program&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Buildup\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The result was a revitalized CPTP and an expansion of its curriculum to a larger segment of the nation's colleges and universities. In May 1939 the first nine schools were selected, nine more were added in August 1940 (as the <a href=\"/wiki/Battle_of_Britain\" title=\"Battle of Britain\">Battle of Britain</a> was raging), 11 more in March 1941, and 15 more by October 1941\u2014four months after the formation of the <a href=\"/wiki/USAAF\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"USAAF\">USAAF</a>\u2014and just two months before the United States' entry into World War&#160;II.  By the program's peak, 1,132 educational institutions and 1,460 flight schools were participating in the CPTP. Institutions such as the <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_Michigan\" title=\"University of Michigan\">University of Michigan</a>; <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_Virginia\" title=\"University of Virginia\">University of Virginia</a>; <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_Washington\" title=\"University of Washington\">University of Washington</a>; <a href=\"/wiki/Georgia_Institute_of_Technology\" title=\"Georgia Institute of Technology\">Georgia Institute of Technology</a>; <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Pomona_Junior_College&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Pomona Junior College (page does not exist)\">Pomona Junior College</a>; <a href=\"/wiki/San_Jos%C3%A9_State_University\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"San Jos\u00e9 State University\">San Jose State Teachers College</a>; and most notably, the <a href=\"/wiki/Tuskegee_Institute\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Tuskegee Institute\">Tuskegee Institute</a>, all included the CPTP in their curricula. (See References below to access complete list of educational institutions participating in the CPTP.)\n</p><p>The inclusion of <a href=\"/wiki/Tuskegee_University\" title=\"Tuskegee University\">Tuskegee University</a> in the ranks of CPTP participants, along with <a href=\"/wiki/Hampton_University\" title=\"Hampton University\">Hampton University</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Virginia_State_University\" title=\"Virginia State University\">Virginia State University</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Delaware_State_University\" title=\"Delaware State University\">Delaware State University</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Howard_University\" title=\"Howard University\">Howard University</a>, helped open the doors for the first <a href=\"/wiki/Tuskegee_Airmen\" title=\"Tuskegee Airmen\">African-American military pilots</a>. The onset of World War II and political pressure combined to compel the <a href=\"/wiki/U.S._Army_Air_Corps\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"U.S. Army Air Corps\">U.S. Army Air Corps</a> \u2014 as it was known before <a href=\"/wiki/United_States_Army_Air_Forces\" title=\"United States Army Air Forces\">June 20, 1941</a> \u2014 to employ African-Americans as officers and pilots, with the majority of its personnel being graduates of the CPTP.\n</p><p>The decision to train civilian pilots also produced an unexpected, but welcome, side effect on the general aviation industry. As it turned out, the United States faced just as large a shortage of training aircraft as it did civilian pilots. The federal <a href=\"/wiki/Civil_Aeronautics_Authority\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Civil Aeronautics Authority\">Civil Aeronautics Authority</a> (predecessor of the <a href=\"/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration\" title=\"Federal Aviation Administration\">Federal Aviation Administration</a>) regulations required a CPTP-participating <a href=\"/wiki/Flight_school\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Flight school\">flight school</a> to own one aircraft for every ten students enrolled in the program.\n</p><p>Furthermore, the requirements specified for these aircraft narrowed down the field to only several models in production at that time, with most flight schools preferring the <a href=\"/wiki/Tandem-seat_configuration\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Tandem-seat configuration\">tandem-seat configuration</a> of the <a href=\"/wiki/Piper_Cub\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Piper Cub\">Piper Cub</a>. Seizing the opportunity unexpectedly thrust upon them, several light aircraft manufacturers quickly filled the market void with CPTP-compatible aircraft of their own, such as the <a href=\"/wiki/Waco_Aircraft_Company\" title=\"Waco Aircraft Company\">WACO</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Waco_F_series\" title=\"Waco F series\">UPF-7</a> and the <a href=\"/wiki/Meyers_Aircraft_Company\" title=\"Meyers Aircraft Company\">Meyers</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Meyers_OTW\" title=\"Meyers OTW\">OTW</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Biplane\" title=\"Biplane\">biplane</a>. <a href=\"/wiki/Aeronca\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Aeronca\">Aeronca</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Taylorcraft\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Taylorcraft\">Taylorcraft</a> also produced <a href=\"/wiki/Tandem\" title=\"Tandem\">tandem</a> versions of their existing <a href=\"/wiki/Side-by-side_seating\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Side-by-side seating\">side-by-side seating</a> high-winged monoplanes, each of which would lead to their own military equivalents.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Entry_into_war\">Entry into war</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Civilian_Pilot_Training_Program&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Entry into war\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>After the <a href=\"/wiki/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor\" title=\"Attack on Pearl Harbor\">attack on Pearl Harbor</a> and the U.S. entrance into World War&#160;II, the CPTP changed forever, including the name. The Civilian Pilot Training Program became the War Training Service (WTS) and, from <a href=\"/wiki/1942_in_aviation\" title=\"1942 in aviation\">1942</a> to <a href=\"/wiki/1944_in_aviation\" title=\"1944 in aviation\">1944</a>, served primarily as the screening program for potential pilot candidates. Students still attended classes at colleges and universities and flight training was still conducted by private flight schools, but all WTS graduates were required to sign a contract agreeing to enter the military following graduation. There is a list of colleges and universities participating in the CPTP in '43-'44 in the appendix of \"They Flew Proud\".\n</p><p>The CPTP/WTS program was largely phased out in the summer of 1944, but not before 435,165 people, including hundreds of women and African-Americans, had been taught to fly. Notable legends trained under the CPTP include: Astronaut/Senator <a href=\"/wiki/John_Glenn\" title=\"John Glenn\">John Glenn</a>, top Navy ace <a href=\"/wiki/Alexander_Vraciu\" title=\"Alexander Vraciu\">Alexander Vraciu</a>, Douglas test pilot Robert Rahn, top World War&#160;II ace Major <a href=\"/wiki/Richard_Bong\" title=\"Richard Bong\">Richard Bong</a>, triple ace <a href=\"/wiki/Bud_Anderson\" title=\"Bud Anderson\">Bud Anderson</a>, former Senator <a href=\"/wiki/George_McGovern\" title=\"George McGovern\">George McGovern</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Women_Airforce_Service_Pilots\" title=\"Women Airforce Service Pilots\">WASP</a> Dora Dougherty and Tuskegee airman Major Robert W. Deiz. The CPTP admirably achieved its primary mission, best expressed by the title of aviation historian Dominick Pisano's book, <i>To Fill the Skies with Pilots</i>.\n</p><p>Two of the largest CPT/WTS schools were Piedmont Aviation, operated by Tom Davis, and Southern Airways, operated by Frank W. Hulse. Piedmont's school was based in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, while Southern had schools in Charlotte, North Carolina, Greenville and Camden, South Carolina, and in Birmingham and Decatur, Alabama. Both companies trained over 60,000 war pilots including young men from Brazil (Piedmont) and a large number of Royal Air Force pilots from England (Southern). By 1947 Davis had turned his school into Piedmont Airlines with scheduled passenger flights between North Carolina and Ohio. In 1949, Hulse had Southern Airways flying commercial service between Jacksonville, Florida and Memphis, Tennessee, and between Atlanta and Charlotte. Both airlines began operations with war surplus Douglas DC-3 aircraft that were modified for commercial service in their former CPT/WTS maintenance hangars.\n</p><p>One of the few women instructors in the CPTP later wrote about her experiences. With the threat of war rising on the horizon, <a href=\"/wiki/Opal_Kunz\" title=\"Opal Kunz\">Opal Kunz</a> renewed her pilot\u2019s license after taking a refresher course at Hagerstown, Maryland, and began teaching aviation students at the Arkansas State College (now <a href=\"/wiki/Arkansas_State_University\" title=\"Arkansas State University\">Arkansas State University</a>). She later moved to Rhode Island, and at the start of World War II became an instructor at the <a href=\"/wiki/Rhode_Island_State_Airport_Terminal\" title=\"Rhode Island State Airport Terminal\">Rhode Island State Airport Terminal</a> for Navy cadets and the government sponsored \u201cCivilian Pilot Training Program (CPTP)\u201d  during the war, teaching over 400 young men how to fly for the Air Corps. This was her old dream of the <a href=\"/wiki/Betsy_Ross_Air_Corps\" title=\"Betsy Ross Air Corps\">Betsy Ross Air Corps</a> come true, as she helped train the men who would fly fighter aircraft in combat. An account from the time shows the work she was doing by saying: \u201cMrs. Kunz has been in Providence since January [1942] as a member of the staff of E. W. <a href=\"/wiki/Wiggins_Airways\" title=\"Wiggins Airways\">Wiggins Airways</a>.  She has a mother\u2019s confidence in her \u2018boys\u2019 and they reciprocate with respect and enthusiasm. Nothing gives her greater joy than to see them solo, to know she has taken them one step nearer to Uncle Sam\u2019s aerial defense line.\u201d  Later, at her home in California, she would recall her experiences with fondness. \u201cI trained about 400 boys and it was easily the highlight of my career. I really became a sort of foster mother to them. You would be surprised how many of my boys brought their wives and children to see me after the war.\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> She also indicated in a letter that she had trained combat pilots. \u201c...I was a flight instructor all during the war.
