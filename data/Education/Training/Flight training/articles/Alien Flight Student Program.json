{"parse":{"title":"Alien Flight Student Program","pageid":5806346,"revid":822279360,"text":{"*":"<div class=\"mw-parser-output\"><p>The <b>Alien Flight Student Program</b> is a program operated by the United States <a href=\"/wiki/Transportation_Security_Administration\" title=\"Transportation Security Administration\">Transportation Security Administration</a> to screen prospective flight student candidates who are not citizens of the United States, before they are allowed to undergo <a href=\"/wiki/Pilot_certification_in_the_United_States\" title=\"Pilot certification in the United States\">pilot training</a>.  This program was created in response to the <a href=\"/wiki/September_11,_2001_attacks\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"September 11, 2001 attacks\">September 11, 2001 attacks</a>, in recognition of the fact that the individuals who piloted the hijacked aircraft first learned to fly at US flight schools.\n</p><p>The mission of the program is to ensure that foreign students seeking training at flight schools regulated by the <a href=\"/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration\" title=\"Federal Aviation Administration\">Federal Aviation Administration</a> (FAA) do not pose a threat to aviation or national security.  Section 612 of the Vision 100 \u2013 Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act (Public Law 108-176, December 12, 2003) prohibits flight schools regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) from providing flight training to a foreign student unless the <a href=\"/wiki/Secretary_of_Homeland_Security\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Secretary of Homeland Security\">Secretary of Homeland Security</a> first determines that the student does not pose a threat to aviation or national security. Vision 100 transferred responsibility for conducting security <a href=\"/wiki/Threat_assessment\" title=\"Threat assessment\">threat assessments</a> for foreign students seeking flight training from the <a href=\"/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice\" title=\"United States Department of Justice\">Department of Justice</a> to the <a href=\"/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security\" title=\"United States Department of Homeland Security\">Department of Homeland Security</a>. On September 20, 2004, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) issued an interim final rule establishing the Alien Flight Student Program (AFSP).\n</p><p>Persons seeking flight training must submit a request if they are not citizens or nationals of the U.S. and:\n</p>\n<ul><li>They wish to receive flight training in the U.S. or its territories, regardless of whether training will lead to an FAA certificate or type rating; and/or</li>\n<li>They wish to receive flight training from an FAA-certificated facility, provider, or instructor that could lead to an FAA rating whether in the U.S. or abroad.</li></ul>\n<p>(NOTE-Certain exemptions to AFSP published in 2004 and 2005 are still in effect.)\n</p><p>The rule as written has a broad scope, and at first seemed to pilots to extend to required regular flight reviews as well proficiency training given to non-citizen private pilots. After consultation with the pilot community, the TSA issued clarifications restricting the scope of the program: for example, in small airplanes, it only applies to pilots undergoing training for an initial <a href=\"/wiki/Pilot_certification_in_the_United_States\" title=\"Pilot certification in the United States\">certificate</a>, a multi-engine rating, or an <a href=\"/wiki/Instrument_Rating_in_the_United_States\" title=\"Instrument Rating in the United States\">instrument rating</a><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20060614003215/http://aopa2.org/tsa_rule/\">[1]</a>.\n</p><p>Candidates log onto the <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.flightschoolcandidates.gov\">AFSP Candidate website</a> to submit their background information and flight training request(s). Once the application process is completed, the AFSP performs a security <a href=\"/wiki/Threat_assessment\" title=\"Threat assessment\">threat assessment</a> to determine whether the Candidate poses a threat to aviation or national security.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Alien_Flight_Student_Program&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li>AFSP Candidate Website, <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.flightschoolcandidates.gov\">www.flightschoolcandidates.gov</a></li>\n<li>Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.aopa.org/tsa_rule/\">Guide to TSA's Alien Flight Training/Citizenship Validation Rule</a></li></ul>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw1255\nCached time: 20180906195900\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.004 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.015 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 14/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 0/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:5806346-0!canonical and timestamp 20180906195900 and revision id 822279360\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","*":"Aviation_in_the_United_States"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Flight_training"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Federal Aviation Administration"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Instrument Rating in the United States"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Pilot certification in the United States"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Secretary of Homeland Security"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"September 11, 2001 attacks"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Threat assessment"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Transportation Security Administration"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"United States Department of Homeland Security"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"United States Department of Justice"}],"templates":[],"images":[],"externallinks":["https://web.archive.org/web/20060614003215/http://aopa2.org/tsa_rule/","http://www.flightschoolcandidates.gov","http://www.aopa.org/tsa_rule/"],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"References","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Alien_Flight_Student_Program","byteoffset":3011,"anchor":"References"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Alien Flight Student Program","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q4726424"}]}}
