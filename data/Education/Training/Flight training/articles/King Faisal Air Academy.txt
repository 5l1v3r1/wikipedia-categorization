The King Faisal Air Academy is a military flight school in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.  Programs include fighter pilot, weapon director, air traffic controller, and information technology training. Training lasts for twenty-seven months. Because most of the Royal Saudi Air Force's equipment is made by the United Kingdom and the United States, instruction is in English, and much of the faculty is British.  Unlike other officer training schools, graduates of KFAA are trained as both pilots and officers  simultaneously and are fully qualified for both flight and command duties upon graduation. Some graduates go on to further training with the United States Air Force at Columbus Air Force Base.
