Qualifying Cross Country, also abbreviated QXC, is a flight training standard. Depending on the license type and country's regulatory requirements, it is generally a flight carried out solo, near the end of student training towards a Private Pilots License (PPL) or Private Ultralight Pilot license.  Normally the student would be expected to plan a triangular course navigation with one leg more than a specified distance and with one or more landings away from the home airfield. The QXC is considered by many pilots to be the single most challenging part of gaining the first pilots license.
