In aviation, a class rating is an allowance to fly a certain group of aircraft that require training common to all aircraft within the group. A type rating is specified if a particular aircraft requires additional specialized training beyond the scope of initial license and aircraft class training. What aircraft require a type rating is decided by the local aviation authority. Almost all single engine piston (SEP) or multi engine piston (MEP) single pilot aircraft can be flown without a type rating, but are covered by a class rating instead.  There are seven categories of aircraft, which may be further subdivided into two or more classes: A Mars water bomber, one of the largest multi-engine sea-class aircraft An airship class aircraft in the aerostat category, a Zeppelin NT An example of a glider class aircraft, a Schweizer SGS 2-33 An example of a rotorcraft class aircraft, a CH-149 Cormorant helicopter An example of a very large multi-engine class aircraft, a C-17 Globemaster III An example of a jet fighter aircraft, a CF-18 Hornet
