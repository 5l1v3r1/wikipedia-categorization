In aviation training, a view-limiting device simulates instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) by restricting a pilot's field of view only to the instrument panel. They are worn by pilots who are working toward an instrument rating, which allows a pilot to fly into conditions that are less than favorable for visual flight.  They are also used by instrument-rated pilots for practicing instrument flight to maintain currency for acting as pilot in command under instrument flight rules.
