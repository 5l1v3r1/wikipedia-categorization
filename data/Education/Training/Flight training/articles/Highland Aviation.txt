  Highland Aviation Training Ltd is an Authorised Training Facility at Inverness Airport.  Highland Aviation provides training towards the EASA/CAA Private Pilots Licence (PPL), the EASA/CAA Light Aircraft Pilot's Licence (LAPL) and the CAA UK National Private Pilots Licence (NPPL).  It also provides training for the UK CAA IMC rating (EASA IR(R)) and the night rating.    In addition to these ratings Highland Aviation also provides beach landing courses  and mountain flying training.  Started in 2009 with a fleet of Piper Aircraft,  Highland Aviation now has over 300 members. Situated near the Cairngorms and the Scottish Highlands, Inverness Airport is a suitable place from which to explore and learn to fly around mountains. Highland Aviation offers trial flights and training courses in mountain flying.   Ben Nevis, Scotland's highest mountain, extends up to only 4,409 ft  allowing pilots to experience mountain flying without having to consider the effect of altitude on aircraft performance.  Beach landing is illegal in most countries without proper permission.   With many secluded areas with long sandy beaches, Scotland is one of the few regions in the world where beach landings are possible.  Highland Aviation is the only training provider in the UK to offer a dedicated course of beach landing instruction. Most of the course is completed at Barra and Sollas.  Beach landings are accomplished by using a soft field approach  with power remaining on throughout the procedure.  This will result, if executed correctly, in a very smooth touchdown with a high nose attitude.  The nose can then be lowered onto the beach gently to avoid digging into the soft sand.
