While flying in actual IMC the pilots must be properly rated and follow instrument flight rules.\n</p><p>IMC exists when weather conditions are below those prescribed for Visual Flight Rules (VFR). VFR minimums are covered under FAR Part 91.155. Typically, IMC means you can not maintain adequate separation from clouds or low in-flight visibility exists. Simulated IMC conditions are accomplished by a pilot wearing a view limiting device while operating the controls of an aircraft. The most common view limiting devices are plastic visor hoods and foggles. Both devices block seeing outside the cockpit while the wearer's head is in a normal forward-facing position. Plastic visors fold over the crown of the pilot's head while foggles are glasses that only allow the bottom portion of the lenses to be transparent.\n</p><p>When a pilot elects to train <i>under the hood</i>, two options are available. The first is to fly with a <a href=\"/wiki/Flight_Instructor\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Flight Instructor\">Certificated Flight Instructor</a> - Instrument (CFII) who sits in the right seat and watches for aircraft, rising terrain, and other dangers. CFIIs typically charge between $30 and $60 per hour. The other option is to fly with a safety pilot.\n</p><p>The safety pilot option is a very popular among <a href=\"/wiki/General_aviation\" title=\"General aviation\">general aviation</a> pilots since it is the lesser expensive of the two options.  Either pilot can potentially log the time as Pilot In Command (PIC) and an agreement of who is acting as Pilot In Command should be discussed before the flight occurs.  The pilot wearing the foggles may log the time on the basis that he or she is rated in the airplane, and is the sole manipulator of the controls.  The safety pilot can log PIC time only if he or she is the agreed upon acting Pilot In Command for the flight.\n</p><p><i>It is important to note that both pilots must agree prior to flight which pilot is the Pilot In Command (PIC). The designated Pilot In Command is responsible for the safe operation of the aircraft and is liable for any mishaps. If the pilot operating the controls of the aircraft is designated the PIC, then the safety pilot cannot log PIC time. If the safety pilot is not the acting Pilot In Command, he or she can, however, log the time as Second-In-Command.</i>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"FAA_Regulations\">FAA Regulations</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Safety_pilot&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: FAA Regulations\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The following excerpts from the <a href=\"/wiki/Code_of_Federal_Regulations\" title=\"Code of Federal Regulations\">CFR</a> Title 14 Aeronautics and Space illustrate the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) pertaining to logging pilot-in-command and the flight experience required for maintaining IFR currency.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Logging_PIC_time\">Logging PIC time</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Safety_pilot&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Logging PIC time\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>FAR Part 1 Defines pilot-in-command as follows:\nPilot in command means the person who:\n(1) Has final authority and responsibility for the operation and safety of the flight;\n(2) Has been designated as pilot in command before or during the flight; and\n(3) Holds the appropriate category, class, and type rating, if appropriate, for the conduct of the flight.\n</p><p>FAR Part 61.51(e) Logging pilot-in-command flight time.\n(1) A sport, recreational, private, commercial, or airline transport pilot may log pilot in command flight time for flights-\n(i) When the pilot is the sole manipulator of the controls of an aircraft for which the pilot is rated, or has sport pilot privileges for that category and class of aircraft, if the aircraft class rating is appropriate;\n(ii) When the pilot is the sole occupant in the aircraft;\n(iii) When the pilot, except for a holder of a sport or recreational pilot certificate, acts as pilot in command of an aircraft for which more than one pilot is required under the type certification of the aircraft or the regulations under which the flight is conducted; or\n</p><p>FAR Part 91.3   Responsibility and authority of the pilot in command.\n(a) The pilot in command of an aircraft is directly responsible for, and is the final authority as to, the operation of that aircraft.\n(b) In an in-flight emergency requiring immediate action, the pilot in command may deviate from any rule of this part to the extent required to meet that emergency.\n(c) Each pilot in command who deviates from a rule under paragraph (b) of this section shall, upon the request of the Administrator, send a written report of that deviation to the Administrator.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"IFR_Currency\">IFR Currency</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Safety_pilot&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: IFR Currency\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>FAR Part 61.57 (c) Instrument experience.
