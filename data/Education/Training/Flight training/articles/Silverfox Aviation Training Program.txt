The Silverfox Aviation Training Program (SATP) is a Royal Canadian Air Cadet training program that streamlines and enhances Air Cadet aviation training. The program is a collection of lessons with tests, handouts, slide shows, and teaching aids. The goal of this training program is to establish a unified and easy to use training program based on the curriculum set forth in the Qualification Standard and Plan by the Canadian Department of National Defence.  The program is administered electronically and free for use by all Commonwealth cadet groups. The program is used mainly in British Columbia, Canada and the Yukon Territory Canada, although it has seen some use in the Canadian province of Alberta and the United Kingdom. Admission and use of the program is open to all Commonwealth cadets.  It may also be used by any not for profit aviation school.  Otherwise licensing is required.  The advanced and scholarship portion of the program is generally used by advanced students hoping to pursue glider and power pilot licenses.
