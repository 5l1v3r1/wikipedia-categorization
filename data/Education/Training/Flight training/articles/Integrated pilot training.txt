Integrated pilot training one of the two ways aviators may train to become qualified. Pilots will normally enter into an ab-initio scheme with a Flight Training Organisation (FTO) where they may have as little as zero hours flight experience, up to or above the minimum requirements of the law of that country or ICAO state. Integrated pilot training was first put to the United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority by Oxford Aviation Training in 1962. It thus became the world's first provider or ab-initio pilot training. Since then the idea has been adopted worldwide.
