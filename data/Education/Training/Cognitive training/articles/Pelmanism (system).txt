Pelmanism was a system of training the mind which was popular in the United Kingdom during the first half of the twentieth century. Originally devised as a memory system in the 1890s by William Joseph Ennever, the system was taught via correspondence from the Pelman Institute in London (named after Christopher Louis Pelman). It was advertised as a system of scientific mental training which strengthened and developed one's mind just as physical training strengthened your body.  It was developed to expand "Mental Powers in every direction" and "remove those tendencies to indolence and inefficiency". The system promised to cure a range of problems such as forgetfulness, depression, phobia, procrastination, and "Lack of System".  Pelmanism was practised and promoted by former British prime minister H.H. Asquith, Sir Robert Baden-Powell (founder of the Boy Scout movement), novelist Sir Rider Haggard, playwright Jerome K. Jerome, and composer Dame Ethel Smyth as well as thousands of less-famous Britons.   In the context of modern psychology, Pelmanism may have only limited academic interest today.[clarification needed] It remains of interest as a self-help opportunity, but is seen by some as quirky and eccentric.
