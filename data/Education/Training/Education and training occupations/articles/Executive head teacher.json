They remain the head teacher of their current school, but also become the strategic leader of one or more other schools. The executive head has no substantive headship in any school but remains the strategic leader of a chain, federation or collaboration of schools. In the case of the third option, the executive head teacher is above the head teachers appointed to manage each individual school within the consortium.\n</p><p>The role of executive heads was first introduced in 2004 when in 1996 the then Prime Minister <a href=\"/wiki/Tony_Blair\" title=\"Tony Blair\">Tony Blair</a> announced that a new policy would allow head teachers who had been classed as outstanding to take over the leadership of schools who had been designated by local authorities as failing. The idea put forward that once the standards in those failing schools had improved, a new head teacher could take over.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> Today however the role and idea of and executive head teacher has expanded, with many staying in place within a system leadership role rather than specific headship roles; working with a number of head teachers.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> \n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Executive_head_teacher&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/340000/executive-heads-summary.pdf\">Executive heads: Summary report</a> National College </span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-2\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><cite class=\"citation web\">Morrison, Nick (9 July 2013). <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/teacher-blog/2013/jul/09/executive-headteacher-schools-leadership\">\"The rise of the executive headteacher\"</a>. <i>the Guardian</i>.</cite><span title=\"ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rft.genre=unknown&amp;rft.jtitle=the+Guardian&amp;rft.atitle=The+rise+of+the+executive+headteacher&amp;rft.date=2013-07-09&amp;rft.aulast=Morrison&amp;rft.aufirst=Nick&amp;rft_id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fteacher-network%2Fteacher-blog%2F2013%2Fjul%2F09%2Fexecutive-headteacher-schools-leadership&amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fen.wikipedia.org%3AExecutive+head+teacher\" class=\"Z3988\"><span style=\"display:none;\">&#160;</span></span></span>\n</li>\n</ol></div></div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Executive_head_teacher&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Head_teacher\" title=\"Head teacher\">Head teacher</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Deputy_head_teacher\" title=\"Deputy head teacher\">Deputy head teacher</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"External_Links\">External Links</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Executive_head_teacher&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: External Links\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://www.nga.org.uk/Guidance/Research/Executive-Headteachers-What-s-in-a-name.aspx%7C\">National Governance Association -
