time, the majority of ALTs were recruited through the JET Programme, but now most are hired by private language teaching companies, also known as \"dispatch companies\", either within Japan or abroad. Once hired, ALTs are sent to work in junior and senior high-schools and, increasingly, in elementary schools throughout Japan. ALTs are either assigned to one main school, or can work at a number of different schools in their area.  ALTs entering on the JET programme are not required to have any prior teaching experience or ESL training. Many ALTs hired privately have prior experience and/or training.\n</p><p>ALTs hired on the JET Programme typically enter either in July or August, but most private ALTs are usually on a contract which runs from April until at least the end of the third school term in March. Some AETs dispatched to City of Nagoya public schools have contracts that begin in mid-May and end in mid-February. Some ALTs also have set, paid holidays during the spring, summer and winter school vacations, in addition to all Japanese public holidays, but some ALTs are not paid between semesters or for national holidays, and do not receive paid vacation leave. By combining the 23 national holidays with the time off during school holidays, the actual number of working days per year is somewhere near 200 through private companies, which is one of the major attractions of the ALT position, however many schools require you to undertake other tasks when not teaching, so the actual hours worked are similar to other jobs in Japan. Most JET Programme ALTs are required to work through the school holidays, receiving the 23 national holidays plus annual leave as holiday time.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Payment\">Payment</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Assistant_Language_Teacher&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Payment\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The pay for a private ALT is usually less than a full-time <a href=\"/wiki/Eikaiwa\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Eikaiwa\">Eikaiwa</a> teacher and far less than a teacher from the <a href=\"/wiki/JET_Programme\" title=\"JET Programme\">JET Programme</a> (\u00a53.36 to \u00a53.96 million depending on year in the program<sup id=\"cite_ref-jetsalary_2-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-jetsalary-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>), with some of the lowest salaries around \u00a5180,000 per month (\u00a52.16 million annually)<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources.

Some provide benefits, such as access to employer subsidized health insurance, paid holidays, paid vacation/sick leave and unemployment insurance, and some do not.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Job_duties\">Job duties</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Assistant_Language_Teacher&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Job duties\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>An ALT's primary duty is to assist Japanese teachers of English to deliver lessons in the classroom, and may be involved in lesson planning and other language teaching tasks. However, the degree to which the Japanese teacher of English actually uses the ALT is usually decided at the discretion of the Japanese teacher. Some allow ALTs to plan and lead language activities in class, sometimes for the entire class period, while others make minimal use of their ALT, such as limiting them to reading new vocabulary words for the students to repeat and having the ALT walk between the rows of students while the students do writing assignments. An ALT also contributes information to teaching advisors on phraseology and pronunciation.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>ALTs usually take part in three to five classes per day. The classes are usually 45\u201350 minutes in length. An ALT participates in about 17 to 20 classes per week. Sometimes ALTs are asked to help teach special education classes, which may include students who have barriers to learning. They may also be asked to take part in after/before school club activities (<i>bukatsud\u014d</i>), such as sports, calligraphy, music or ikebana, to learn more about the culture alongside their students and to foster international exchange. However, some ALTs choose not to participate, or go from group to group just to visit. The English level of the students varies from school to school, and at some schools the students and teachers are unable to communicate in English in any meaningful way. Higher level high schools sometimes have an English club, which the ALT would attend and assist in the students' planning and preparations for debate contests, speech competitions and English camps.\n</p><p>ALTs may also be asked to perform tasks normally done by Japanese students and teachers, such as cleaning the school, cleaning drainage gutters, and removing snow from parking areas. ALTs at some schools, mostly junior high schools, are expected to eat lunch with the students. These ALTs might not be allowed to leave the school for lunch or to run personal errands during their break. ALTs may be instructed to use non-standard English in front of students.  They are sometimes asked to perform clerical tasks, such as correcting student writing assignments, by the Japanese teachers.\n</p><p>ALTs may be required to read aloud stories about <a href=\"/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki\" title=\"Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki\">atomic bombings</a> and the lingering deaths of Japanese children to their classes, which omit any mention of <a href=\"/wiki/World_War_II\" title=\"World War II\">World War II</a> or the Japanese government's <a href=\"/wiki/Japanese_war_crimes\" title=\"Japanese war crimes\">conduct during the war</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Overview_of_the_private_ALT_system_in_Japan\">Overview of the private ALT system in Japan</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Assistant_Language_Teacher&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Overview of the private ALT system in Japan\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In 1999, Dispatch Law (\u52b4\u50cd\u8005\u6d3e\u9063) was deregulated to allow dispatch companies to enter into other fields of work aside from the traditional industry of manufacturing, including education. Since then more and more local boards of education have turned to private language companies to provide ALTs rather than using the JET Programme.\n</p><p>The business of private language teaching companies providing ALTs is increasing and some with hundreds of ALTs are covering all parts of the country.  There is the impression that the private sector in general continues to grow as The JET Programme loses share in the market. Private dispatch companies vary from large corporations to local firms.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Differences_between_JET_Programme_ALTs_and_private_company_ALTs\">Differences between JET Programme ALTs and private company ALTs</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Assistant_Language_Teacher&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Differences between JET Programme ALTs and private company ALTs\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<ul><li><b>Application:</b> The JET Programme may be very competitive based on the hiring nation (the US, UK, Canada, Australia being examples) or very lax depending on the needs of the Programme for any fiscal year. Private ALT application processes vary, but tend to be highly competitive for smaller companies and very open with larger companies.</li>\n<li><b>Compensation:</b> As of 2016, JET Programme ALTs are compensated between \u00a53.36 and \u00a53.96 million annually depending on their year in the program<sup id=\"cite_ref-jetsalary_2-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-jetsalary-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>. JET Programme participants will on average receive a higher initial monthly salary than ALTs from most private companies. However, some private companies require ALTs with TEFL certification who may be compensated at a higher level. This is rare, however, with some dispatched ALTs earning as little as \u00a52.2 million per annum<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources. (April 2018)\">citation needed</span></a></i>&#93;</sup>.</li>\n<li><b>Support:</b> The JET Programme has a nationwide support system for ALTs that tends to vary in utility based on the nature of each case. Private language companies that provide ALTs to BOEs vary in their approaches to supporting ALTs, ranging from a very hands-off approach to an experience more professionally invigorating than the JET Programme. Private ALTs tend to be more experienced and better trained to start, many being ex-JETs. Teacher support and professional development vary with company.</li>\n<li><b>Workload:</b> The JET Programme typically follows the request of the BOE regarding the workload of each ALT. A frequent issue with JET Programme ALTs is being required to report to a town office or education center when school is not in session, often when they have no other work to do. In general, ALTs provided by private language teaching companies do not require ALTs to report to the local BOE on days when school is not in session, although they may be required to attend training or asked to take other work during working time. Typically workload and salary are related, in that lower pay is accompanied by fewer required working days or hours.</li>\n<li><b>External Work:</b> JET Programme ALTs are generally prohibited from working outside the school. Private companies have differing policies that may or may not allow legal work on the side, however, most tend to either provide supplementary work at their own clients, or allow ALTs to seek extra work if they so choose.</li>\n<li><b>Contractual Term Limits</b>: JET Programme ALTs have a limited number of years to be contracted (to a maximum of 3 or 5 years, with contract renewals happening yearly), while private companies have no such restriction in most cases.</li></ul>\n<p>The above list is by no means comprehensive, and some other categories that vary from situation to situation may include: the ability to transfer (both locationally and between positions), evaluation, reward systems, and professional development opportunities.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Union_Activity_and_ALTs\">Union Activity and ALTs</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Assistant_Language_Teacher&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Union Activity and ALTs\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Education_law\">Education law</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Assistant_Language_Teacher&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: Education law\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Some of the contracts that school boards have signed with private language teaching companies are illegal <i>gyomu itaku</i> (service contracts).

In actuality, working hours usually range from 30 to 40 hours due to the fact that transition times between classes and other brief periods of time throughout the working day are scheduled as breaktimes. Employers often have employees sign such contracts in an effort to avoid paying into the employer based Social Insurance program, or <a href=\"/wiki/Social_welfare_in_Japan\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Social welfare in Japan\">Shakai hoken</a>. While Social Insurance law states that all regular employees should be enrolled by their employer in Shakai Hoken, companies consistently tell their employees that they are ineligible. Their reasoning is that the 29.5 hours a week working time written into the contracts fall below an erroneous minimum of 3/4 full-time necessary for eligibility. The Social Insurance Agency uses the 3/4 of the hours of a similar full-time as a guideline.<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>  However, the Japanese government has recent stated that there is, in fact, no minimum legal work time requirement for enrollment in Shakai Hoken.
