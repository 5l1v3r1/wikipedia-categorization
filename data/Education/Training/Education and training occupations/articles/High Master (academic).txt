High master is the term used, in place of the more conventional "headmaster",  "head teacher" or "principal", to denote the head teachers of two English independent schools: Manchester Grammar School  and St Paul's School  in London. The equivalent high mistress is used for female headteachers at some independent schools, including St Paul's Girls' School and Abercorn School.
