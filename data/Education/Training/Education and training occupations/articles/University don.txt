A don is a fellow or tutor of a college or university, especially traditional collegiate universities such as Oxford and Cambridge and Durham in England,  and Trinity College, Dublin, in Ireland. The term don is also used for a teacher at Winchester College, England.  Like the term don used for Roman Catholic priests, the term don derives from the Latin dominus, meaning "lord", and is a historical remnant of Oxford and Cambridge having started as ecclesiastical institutions in the Middle Ages.  At some universities in Canada, such as the University of King's College  and the University of New Brunswick,  a don is the senior head of a university residence.  At these institutions, a don is typically a faculty member, staff member, or postgraduate student, whose responsibilities in the residence are primarily administrative.  The don supervises their residence and a team of undergraduate resident assistants, proctors, or other student employees. In other Canadian institutions, such as Huron College  and the University of Toronto,  a don is a resident assistant, typically an upper-year student paid a stipend to act as an advisor to and supervisor of the students in a university residence.
