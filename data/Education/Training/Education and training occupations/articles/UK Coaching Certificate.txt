The UK Coaching Certificate (UKCC) is a recognised qualification endorsement scheme provided by Sports Coach UK. Its aims are to enable governing bodies of various sports across the UK to develop coaching programmes, have these programmes endorsed as being of an acceptable level of quality, and then to improve these programmes over time.  As of  2014[update], 28 sports have at least level 1 endorsement.
