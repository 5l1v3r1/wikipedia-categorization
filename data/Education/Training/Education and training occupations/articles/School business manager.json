This position exists in schools in the United Kingdom, but not in most public schools in the United States. They oversee the business management of schools \u2013 all the administrative and logistical aspects of running a school so that these are done in the most effective and efficient way possible. Through this, they free up the school\u2019s <a href=\"/wiki/Headteacher\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Headteacher\">headteacher</a> to focus on leading teaching and learning.\n</p><p>Although generally not in possession of <a href=\"/wiki/Qualified_Teacher_Status\" title=\"Qualified Teacher Status\">Qualified Teacher Status</a>, SBMs with appropriate training and experience are increasingly serving on the school\u2019s leadership team, bringing additional leadership skills and a commercial outlook to the school\u2019s strategic decision making. Almost all secondary schools and about a third of primary schools have school business managers serving on their leadership team.\n</p><p>The SBM role has evolved from that of the school <a href=\"/wiki/Bursar\" title=\"Bursar\">bursar</a>, but whereas bursars typically focus on purely financial administrative matters, SBMs have a broader remit. SBM duties vary from school-to-school and include:\n</p><p>- <b>Financial management</b>, including setting budgets, negotiating contracts with suppliers\n</p><p>- <b>Financial reporting</b>, fundraising and making best use of resources\n</p><p>- <b>Management of support staff</b>, such as teaching assistants, catering staff and cleaners\npremises management\n</p><p>- <b>Human resources</b>, including overseeing staff training strategic planning, including meeting long-term education challenges and developments, such as the <a href=\"/wiki/Every_Child_Matters\" title=\"Every Child Matters\">Every Child Matters</a> Agenda\n</p><p>- <b>Health and safety</b>\n</p><p>- <b>Relationship management</b> with other schools and external partners\n</p><p>In secondary schools \u2013 or where groups of schools are working together in a cluster or federation \u2013 SBMs will often have a broader, more strategic role, with some functions delegated to administrative support staff. In primary schools, an SBM may have an even more hands-on role, spending time on detailed administrative and financial tasks.\n</p><p>The SBM position is still evolving, with higher-level, more strategic roles, such as Advanced School Business Managers and School Business Directors, emerging. The potential of these is being tested through a series of demonstration projects.<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.ncsl.org.uk/programmes-index/sbm-index/bdp-sbmfuture-index/bdp-sbmfuture-demonstrationprojects.htm\">[1]</a>\n</p><p>The profession required a set of standards like that of other professional professions. The National Association of School Business Management (NASBM) have launched a set of professional standards available via the following link: <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.nasbm.co.uk/professionalstandards\">www.nasbm.co.uk/professionalstandards</a> - this project will soon link to future new qualifications. \n</p><p><br />\nSchool business managers can study for a number of professional qualifications through the <a href=\"/wiki/National_College_for_Teaching_and_Leadership\" title=\"National College for Teaching and Leadership\">National College for School Leadership</a>* and its School Business Manager Development Programme.<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.ncsl.org.uk/programmes-index/sbm-index/bdp-sbmfuture-index.htm\">[2]</a> These qualifications are the Certificate of School Business Management (CSBM)<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.ncsl.org.uk/programmes-index/csbm-index.htm\">[3]</a>, the Diploma of School Business Management (DSBM),<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.ncsl.org.uk/programmes-index/dsbm-index.htm\">[4]</a> and the Advanced Diploma of School Business management launched in March 2008.<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.ncsl.org.uk/programmes-index/adsbm-index.htm\">[5]</a> The senior course, the School Business Director's Course (SBD), was launched in 2010 and lasts around 18 months.<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.ncsl.org.uk/programmes-index/sbd-index.htm\">[6]</a> They are delivered through a series of cohorts during the year, using a mixture of face-to-face residential elements, self-directed study and e-learning. The qualifications are internationally accredited by the Institute of Administrative Management.<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.instam.org/\">[7]</a> * Now called the National College for Teaching and Leadership (NCTL).\n</p><p>Note that the National College for Teaching and Leadership (formerly the National College for School Leadership) based in Nottingham, England, ceased its direct involvement with school business management training in 2014/15. However, SBM programmes continue to be offered by various other providers, including those originally commissioned by the NCTL.
