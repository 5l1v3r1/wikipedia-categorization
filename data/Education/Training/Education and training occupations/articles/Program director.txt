In service industries, such as education, a program manager or program director researches, plans, develops and implements one or more of the firm's professional services. For example, in education, a program director is responsible for developing and maintaining degree-granting programs and/or other educational services. In program management, the Program Director is a senior manager responsible for the overall success of the program.  A program director's role in a company that sells professional services is similar to a product manager's role in a company that sells tangible goods. In radio or television, a program director or director of programming is the person who develops or selects some or all of the content that will be broadcast. A program director's selections are based upon expertise in the media as well as knowledge of the target demographic.  Typically, a program director decides what radio program or TV program will be broadcast and when. In the context of non-profit organizations, a program director is responsible for managing one or more of the organization's programs or services in a role similar to that of a chief operating officer.
