The coach is aided by a number of assistant coaches, one of which carries the responsibility for the training and preparation of the <a href=\"/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)\" title=\"Goalkeeper (association football)\">goalkeepers</a>. The coach is also assisted by medical staff and <a href=\"/wiki/Athletic_trainer\" title=\"Athletic trainer\">athletic trainers</a>. The medium to long term strategy of a football club, with regard to transfer policies, youth development and other sporting matters, is not the business of a coach in most football countries.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources.

In football, the director of a professional football team is more commonly awarded the position of <a href=\"/wiki/Manager_(association_football)\" title=\"Manager (association football)\">manager</a>, a role that combines the duties of coach and sporting director.\n</p><p>The responsibilities of a European football manager tend to be divided up in North American professional sports, where the teams usually have a separate <a href=\"/wiki/General_manager_(sports)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"General manager (sports)\">general manager</a> and head coach, although occasionally a person may fill both roles of general manager and head coach. While the first team coach in football is usually an assistant to the manager who actually holds the real power, the American style general manager and head coach have clearly distinct areas of responsibilities. For example, a typical European football manager would have the final say on player lineups and contract negotiations, while in American sports these duties would be handled separately by the head coach and general manager, respectively.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Baseball\">Baseball</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Coach_(sport)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Baseball\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Coach_(baseball)\" title=\"Coach (baseball)\">Coach (baseball)</a></div>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">See also: <a href=\"/wiki/Manager_(baseball)\" title=\"Manager (baseball)\">Manager (baseball)</a></div>\n<p>In <a href=\"/wiki/Baseball\" title=\"Baseball\">baseball</a>, at least at the professional level in North America, the individual who heads the coaching staff does not use the title of \"head coach\", but is instead called the <a href=\"/wiki/Manager_(baseball)\" title=\"Manager (baseball)\">field manager</a>.

Recognising the pivotal role played by coaches in increasing participation and performance in sport, each of the UK's Home Country Sports Councils has a coaching strategy aligned to their overall strategy.\n</p><p>In June 2008, the Sports Councils together with the national governing bodies of sport (NGBs) formally adopted the UK Coaching Framework at the UK Coaching Summit in Coventry.\n</p><p>More than thirty sports have their coach education programmes endorsed as meeting the standards of the <a href=\"/wiki/UK_Coaching_Certificate\" title=\"UK Coaching Certificate\">UK Coaching Certificate</a> (UKCC) as an indication of quality assurance. Typically, such programmes classify coaches within Levels 1\u20134, with Level 2 being the minimum standard for someone to coach unaccompanied. Coach education programmes are usually organised centrally by the NGBs but delivered locally to meet the needs of volunteer coaches. For anyone wanting to become a coach in a particular sport, the NGB website provides the first point of contact for further information.\n</p><p>Each of the counties in England has a County Sports Partnership (CSP) funded by <a href=\"/wiki/Sport_England\" title=\"Sport England\">Sport England</a> which supports local coaching networks to bring coaches from different sports together to share best practice and gain further continuing professional development (CPD). Similar arrangements exist across Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.\n</p><p>The safeguarding and protection of children in sport has been a major focus for sports coach UK and the <a href=\"/wiki/NSPCC\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"NSPCC\">NSPCC</a> for many years. Short workshops on safeguarding are the most popular of all CPD sessions organised by sports coach UK and delivered across the CSP network.\n</p><p>The UK government, through <a href=\"/wiki/Department_for_Culture,_Media_and_Sport\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Department for Culture, Media and Sport\">DCMS</a>, highlighted the need for detailed research into sports coaching patterns. As a result, major tracking studies have been completed. These confirm that three in every four coaches are volunteers, typically giving up three hours a week to coach their sport.

The head coach at the professional level has more time to devote to tactics and playbooks, which are combed over by staff that are usually paid more than at the college level. The pro level head coaching, due to the extensive time on the road and long hours, is a very stressful job. Since the money is good at high levels, many coaches retire in their early fifties. Also, professional staffs are not limited in the number of assistants which can be hired, NCAA Division I FBS teams are limited to nine full-time assistant coaches.\n</p><p>Many factors are part of NFL coaches' contracts.

Without emotion, communication would be inefficient. Emotions provide context and reason of the way individuals feel after a specific situation related to communication. \u201cEmotions can play an important role in how we think and behave.\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> Decisions are made from emotions and emotions can directly reflect the communication within experiences.   \n\u201cAthletes\u2019 expressions of dissent are largely unrecognized, which limits coaches\u2019 abilities to manage their teams and athletes\u2019 abilities to voice themselves effectively\u201d <sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>. Coaching a sports team can be a highly emotional experience due to the high pressure of success. Fans rely on the athletes for success; however, the fans highly explain the absence of success on the coaching staff. When a team is unsuccessful, fans blame the coaching staff because they are the management of the team. Coaching is also highly emotional due to emotions of athletes. Coaching is a high demand profession in which focuses directly on communication. Coaching would be impossible without communication. Clear and concise communication is needed to effectively engage with athletes and express actions. Concise communication is needed in coaching sports\u2019 teams to effectively discuss direction of tasks. This can be an emotional process because athletes correspond differently to different communication styles. Coaching is an emotional experience because you must worry about not only your own emotions but also the athletes\u2019 emotions.  Emotions can be segregated between positive and negative and those can subsequently have a positive or negative outcome on the coaching environment. Emotions are used every day and provide feelings as well as a form of communication. There are many forms of emotions within communication; however, coaches focus on positive and negative emotions, verbal and nonverbal emotions and communication to interact with athletes to promote success. \nCoaches express positive emotion to promote motivation among athletes. Many of the positive emotions expressed by athletes and coaches can be expressed but hard to define as a coach have to focus on limiting the negative emotions and showing up for his player positive emotions that will help him compete and not feel any lack of confidence &amp; self esteem.  While there are hundreds of positive emotions, positive emotions such as gratitude, interest, hope, pride, and inspiration are all emotions expressed by coaches and athletes. \n</p><p>\u201cGratitude is a feeling of appreciation felt by and/or similar positive response shown by the recipient of kindness, gifts, help, favors, or other types of generosity, towards the giver of such gifts\u201d <sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup>. Gratitude can be a positive emotion expressed by coaches by the act of generosity towards players. Ohio State University football team uses stickers on the players\u2019 helmets as a form of success. According to ESPN, \u201cEvery team member, however, receives a buckeye for each OSU win, plus an additional sticker for Big Ten victories.\u201d <sup id=\"cite_ref-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup> Ohio State University football coaches use the emotion, gratitude, by expressing generosity by giving stickers (gifts) and feelings of appreciation toward athletes.\n</p><p>Interest is an emotion that causes attention to focus on a specific object and generates curiosity. The curiosity imposed by interest not only is the state of attention; it is rather a state of attraction. Attention drawn to a something specific can be described as interest. An interest is curiosity or desire in something specific. For example, a coach of a sports team may have interest in his athletes by caring for them on and off the field. Coaches monitor athlete\u2019s performance off the field in areas such as school and personal lives. The balance is important for a coach to maintain because the coaches being too involved would create conflict and interference with the athletes\u2019 personal lives. Coaches express interest in athletes through recruiting as well. Expressing interest in an athlete at a college level involves the coaches reaching out to the athlete and expressing interest for the athlete to join their program. \n</p><p>\tHope derives from human emotion and comes from comfort and security. The emotion of hope is when an individual believes in something in which is yet to be determined. For example, a coach may have hope in his athletes in that they perform to their best ability. \u201cI hope he catches this ball to score the touchdown\u201d. An athlete may also experience the emotion hope. An athlete may hope for success in relation to their future. Hope is an emotion in which describes the individual's aspirations for future endeavors. Coaches\u2019 hope for the team can positively affect the direction and mentality of a team. \n</p><p>\tPride is an emotion in which an individual may feel accomplished and happy. Pride usually comes after some sort of success. The feeling of pride comes from a sense of achievement. A coach may experience pride within himself or with his athletes after winning an important game. The emotion of pride is often frowned upon, regarding religion; however, pride is important in coaching because the athletes should feel appreciated and wanted from the coach therefore causing a sense of pride. Being prideful in coaching is more about the team being successful opposed to the coach himself. Pride as an emotion can be described as a key component to a successful coaching strategy.    \n</p><p>\tInspiration is an emotion that describes the feeling of wanting to be better. Inspiration usually comes after great success. For example, after a very successful season, a team may be inspired to be better than the previous season. A coach may be inspired by his athletes because they have challenged him to be better as well. Coaching is the primary responsibility and focus for the success of the team. For a coach to be highly successful, he or she must inspire his athletes to be great. Inspiration is an emotion in which you feel the desire to accomplish set goals.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Preparation\">Preparation</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Coach_(sport)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: Preparation\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Coaching courses and training seminars are increasingly available.

For every sport, there are different game plans.<sup id=\"cite_ref-16\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-16\">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup> For example, in association football, the coach may choose to have a <a href=\"/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)\" title=\"Goalkeeper (association football)\">goalkeeper</a>, four <a href=\"/wiki/Defender_(association_football)\" title=\"Defender (association football)\">defenders</a>, four <a href=\"/wiki/Midfielders\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Midfielders\">midfielders</a>, and two <a href=\"/wiki/Forward_(association_football)\" title=\"Forward (association football)\">forwards</a>.

It is up to the coaches to decide how many players will play a certain position at a time, as long as they do not surpass the maximum number of players allowed on the playing field at one time. It is also up to the coaches to decide where and when a certain player is going to play.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Coach_(sport)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"div-col columns column-width\" style=\"-moz-column-width: 30em; -webkit-column-width: 30em; column-width: 30em;\">\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Head_coach\" title=\"Head coach\">Head coach</a> (<a href=\"/wiki/American_football\" title=\"American football\">American football</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Fitness_professional\" title=\"Fitness professional\">Fitness professional</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Manager_(association_football)\" title=\"Manager (association football)\">Manager (association football)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Coach_(baseball)\" title=\"Coach (baseball)\">Coach (baseball)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Manager_(baseball)\" title=\"Manager (baseball)\">Manager (baseball)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Coach_(basketball)\" title=\"Coach (basketball)\">Coach (basketball)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Manager_(Gaelic_games)\" title=\"Manager (Gaelic games)\">Manager (Gaelic games)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Coach_(ice_hockey)\" title=\"Coach (ice hockey)\">Coach (ice hockey)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Player-coach\" title=\"Player-coach\">Player-coach</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Player-manager\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Player-manager\">Player-manager</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Coaching_staff\" title=\"Coaching staff\">Coaching staff</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Coaching_tree\" title=\"Coaching tree\">Coaching tree</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Coach_of_the_Year\" title=\"Coach of the Year\">Coach of the Year</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Personal_trainer\" title=\"Personal trainer\">Personal trainer</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Sports_trainer\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sports trainer\">Sports trainer</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Strength_and_conditioning_coach\" title=\"Strength and conditioning coach\">Strength and conditioning coach</a></li></ul>\n</div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Notes\">Notes</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Coach_(sport)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12\" title=\"Edit section: Notes\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap mw-references-columns\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Dave Day, <i>Professionals, Amateurs and Performance: Sports Coaching in England, 1789\u20131914</i> (2012)</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-2\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><cite class=\"citation web\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.fai.ie/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=100028&amp;Itemid=291\">\"Phase 1 \u2013 The FUNdamental Phase\"</a>. <a href=\"/wiki/Football_Association_of_Ireland\" title=\"Football Association of Ireland\">Football Association of Ireland</a>. 12 June 2009<span class=\"reference-accessdate\">.
