In Canada, a B.Ed. degree is required for teaching certification.\n</p><p>A B.Ed. program may have direct entry from high school; as a combined degree with another bachelor's degree (e.g., B.A./B.Ed.); or as an after-degree program where the candidate has obtained a bachelor's degree, usually, the field in which the student wishes to teach. A good rapport or previous experience with young children or teens is also a desired characteristic of applicants.\n</p><p>There are several streams to a Bachelor of Education, each corresponding to the particular level of instruction.

In the high school (secondary education) stream, the student specializes in one to two subject areas. Upon completion of the degree, they will prepare and eventually sit for the state's Board of Education certification examination.\n</p><p>A typical B.Ed. program may include coursework in <a href=\"/wiki/Pedagogy\" title=\"Pedagogy\">pedagogy</a>, educational psychology, educational policy and leadership, assessment, curriculum development; and lesson planning, social justice, special education, and instructional technology.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Australia\">Australia</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Bachelor_of_Education&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Australia\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In Australia, a 4-Year Bachelor of Education degree combines practical/pedagogical study with a Major sequence in the academic discipline of Education. In the majority of Australian universities, there is usually 2 distinct types of the Bachelor of Education: Primary and Secondary. The subjects and degree programs are quite different in both degrees e.g. for a student studying the Bachelor of Education (Primary) the focus of their degree would lie in behaviour, children, basic literacy, how children learn etc. For a student studying the Bachelor of Education (Secondary) they would therefore be teaching roughly 11- to 18-year-old adolescents and their programs would have less focus on those kinds of areas by the Primary degree. Instead, the degree is based around the student's intending teaching subjects; usually 1 or 2. In NSW, these teaching areas provide the major focus for their degrees in their final years. They consist of: English, Mathematics, Science (Biology, Physics &amp; Chemistry), Geography, History, Business Studies, Legal Studies, Economics, Society &amp; Culture and Languages.\nThe longer duration of the course allows for more practical experiences and greater personal or professional development before teaching service. Most Australian State Teacher-Certification bodies require either a Bachelor of Education, or a bachelor's degree in one or two subject areas, with a Graduate Diploma in Education as a minimum. A B.Ed. is not to be confused with the lesser degree Bachelor of Teaching, which is usually an 'End-On' course similar but slightly longer than a Graduate Diploma in Education.\n</p><p>Note: In Australia, the term Undergraduate Degree is used to describe all degrees undertaken by a first-time university student and usually no pre-requisite tertiary level studies are required, mostly just the completion of Secondary High School. Postgraduate degrees are used to describe the degrees completed with an Undergraduate degree as pre-requisite.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Bangladesh\">Bangladesh</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Bachelor_of_Education&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Bangladesh\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In Bangladesh, Bachelor of Education (B.Ed.) is an undergraduate professional degree for Hons.(4 years) and Diploma(1/2/3 years) in Education offered by the authorized Teachers Training Institutes or Colleges for those aimed their profession as a Teacher or as an Education and Curriculum Specialist or as an Educationalist in the government and non-governmental educational institutes or any educational organizations such as <a href=\"/wiki/Save_the_Children\" title=\"Save the Children\">Save the Children</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/UNICEF\" title=\"UNICEF\">UNICEF</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/United_Nations_Development_Programme\" title=\"United Nations Development Programme\">United Nations Development Programme</a>, BFES, SSUF, ASA etc. B.Ed. degree is mandatory for the teaching profession in both of primary and Secondary school level.
