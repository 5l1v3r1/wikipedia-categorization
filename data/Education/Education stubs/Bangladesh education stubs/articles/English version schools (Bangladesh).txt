English version school is a system of education in Bangladesh that follows the national curriculum and based upon textbooks translated from the Bengali language into English.  There are approximately 52 English version schools in Dhaka.  In 2011 the first Internet based English version school opened in Gazipur.   English version significantly lacks quality in its textbooks, and many guidance books, available for the Bangla version, are also missing in school level. The condition of English version is too poor as they don't have many textbooks let alone the quality of the textbooks. English version schools are not available in most citie,s and more schools are Bangla version in small cities and upazilas. The government of Bangladesh opened the first English version schools in cadet colleges in the late 1990s.   English version is different from English medium schools. While English medium schools follow the curriculum of Edexcel or Cambridge International Examination, English version schools follow the national curriculum and hold national examinations in English.  English versions schools are usually less costly than English medium schools.   Zia Hasan International School in Tangail in 2010 became the first English version school in a rural area.
