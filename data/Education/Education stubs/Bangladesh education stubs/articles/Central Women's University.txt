 Central Women's University (Bengali: কেন্দ্রীয় মহিলা বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়) is one of the first private universities in Bangladesh, established in 1993. It was the first university in Bangladesh established exclusively for the purpose of female education. Beggzadi Mahmuda Nasir served as the founding vice-chancellor of the university until 1999.   Following mismanagement on the part of the original governing body, it was one of the eight universities the University Grants Commission of Bangladesh recommended for shutting down due to poor quality of academic standards.  The university was also served with show-cause notice by judicial authorities asking why it would not be closed down.  As of August, 2010, the University has received legal permission from the court to continue its educational activities under a new governing body and with new academic faculty and expanded academic offerings.
