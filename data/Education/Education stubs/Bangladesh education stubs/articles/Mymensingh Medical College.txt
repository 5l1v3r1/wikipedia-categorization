Mymensingh Medical College (Bengali: ময়মনসিংহ মেডিকেল কলেজ) is a government medical school in Bangladesh,  established in 1924. It is located in the Mymensingh District of the Mymensingh Division. Mymensingh Medical Journal, which is Index Medicus/MEDLINE listed, is the official journal of Mymensingh Medical College. Brigadier General Md. Nasir Uddin Ahmed is the present director of the medical college hospital.  During the later part of British India, it was felt that the people of the northeastern region needed the services of qualified medical personnel. The then Campbell Medical School of Calcutta and Mitford Medical School of Dhaka were unable to cater the needs of the growing population. With this background the third medical school for the region, was established in 1924 in Mymensingh, by the Earl of Lytton, the then governor of Bengal. The Lytton Medical School was to run a four-year course of Licentiate of Medical Faculty (LMF). This course of LMF continued till 1962, when it was upgraded to a five-year undergraduate medical course under Dhaka University and the school was renamed as Mymensingh Medical College.   This is the 2nd established Hospital in Bangladesh. Foundation Of MMCH Mymensingh Medical College Hospital Centre for Nuclear Medicine and Ultrasound in MMCH Nursing Institute in MMCH
