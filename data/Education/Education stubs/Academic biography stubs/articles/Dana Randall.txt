Dana Randall is a professor of theoretical computer science at Georgia Tech, where she is the Director of the Algorithms and Randomness Center and the ADVANCE Professor of Computing. Randall was born in Queens, New York. She graduated from New York City's Stuyvesant High School in 1984.  She received her A.B. in Mathematics from Harvard University in 1988 and her Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of California, Berkeley in 1994 under the supervision of Alistair Sinclair.  Her sister is theoretical physicist Lisa Randall. Her primary research interest is analyzing algorithms for counting problems (e.g. counting matchings in a graph) using Markov chains. One of her important contributions to this area is a decomposition theorem for analyzing Markov chains. In 2012 she became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.  She delivered her Arnold Ross Lecture on October 29, 2009, an honor previously conferred on Barry Mazur, Elwyn Berlekamp, Ken Ribet, Manjul Bhargava, David Kelly and Paul Sally.
