Vukan R. Vuchic (Serbian: Vukan Vučić, Serbian Cyrillic: Вукан Вучић; born 14 January 1935) is a public transport expert, a professor of the University of Pennsylvania,  and a former consultant to the United States Department of Transportation on the planning, design and operation of transport systems. In 1994, he was elected a member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts.  Vuchic has made a qualified point about the economic value of public transport for cities, assessing the comparative worth of buses, light rail, or rapid transit. He notes that each has a particular urban-geographic setting in which is the better choice. Buses, for instance, are superior to light rail in areas of low density. He contrasts that with rapid transit, which is superior wherever high-capacity, high-speed service is warranted, due to greater population density. Light rail is the optimal solution for transit services of the intermediate kind, being competitive with the automobile where there are space restrictions, but where demand is moderate and high-cost investments are not feasible. Of particular interest is his study indicating a better economic result for cities with light rail services, compared to those of similar size that had bus services.
