Barbara Duden (born 1942 in Greifswald) is a German medical historian, scholar of gender studies, and emeritus professor of the University of Hannover. Her work figures significantly in the currents that established the body as a site for historical inquiry. She is one of the founders of the journal Courage, which was in publication from 1976 to 1984. Courage primarily circulated in West Berlin where it played an extensive role in informing the women's movement at the time. Her father is also the great-grandson the German philologist Konrad Duden.
