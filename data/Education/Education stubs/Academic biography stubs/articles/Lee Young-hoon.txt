Lee Young-hoon (이영훈, 李榮薰, born 1951 in Daegu, South Korea), Lee Yong-hoon, Rhee Yong-hoon, or Yi Yŏnghun is a professor Emeritus of Economics at Seoul National University and the president of the Naksungdae Institute of Economic Research (낙성대경제연구소).  He is a member of the Textbook Forum of the New Right Party.  He is known as the new positivistic research on the Economy of Joseon.  He challenged the Korean's common beliefs--"Japanese colonial rule and development has been considered an absolute evil"--by arguing that comfort women were prostitutes and that the number of the women and forced laborer is exaggerated in Korea's textbooks.        After raising a doubt by saying, "(If there's any) Tell me which scholar is actually claiming that Governor-General of Korea forcibly transported comfort women", he was severely criticised in South Korea and forced to get down on his hands and knees in front of comfort women to apologise them.   He graduated from Department of Economics, Seoul University and earned Doctor of Economics. He was an associate professor of Economics at Hanshin University and a professor of Sungkyunkwan University. He is co-representative of Textbook Forum.
