Robert (Rob) D. Morris is a mathematician who works in combinatorics, probability, graph theory and Ramsey theory. He is a researcher at IMPA.  In 2015, Morris was awarded the European Prize in Combinatorics for "his profound results in extremal and probabilistic combinatorics particularly for his result on independent sets in hypergraphs which found immediately several applications in additive number theory and combinatorics, such as the solution of old problem of Erdős and for establishing tight bounds for Ramsey numbers, and also on random cellular automata and bootstrap problems in percolation."  In 2016, he was one of the winners of the George Pólya Prize.  He graduated with a Ph.D. from The University of Memphis in 2006 under the supervision of Béla Bollobás.  He was awarded the 2018 Fulkerson Prize.
