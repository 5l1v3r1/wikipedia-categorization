Professor Alexander Grossmann started out as a researcher and lecturer, working variously at the University of Tübingen, the Jülich Research Centre, and the Max Planck Institute in Munich.  In 2001, Prof. Grossmann took a career shift and moved into scholarly publishing. He first took a position at Wiley-Blackwell, and then moved to Springer-Verlag GmbH in Vienna where he was Managing Director. Subsequently, Grossmann became Vice President at scientific publishing house De Gruyter. In 2013, Prof. Grossmann partnered with Tibor Tscheke, a Boston-based entrepreneur and software developer, and together they founded a for-profit open access publishing platform called ScienceOpen. At around the same time, Grossmann took a post as Professor of Publishing Management at the Leipzig University of Applied Sciences.
