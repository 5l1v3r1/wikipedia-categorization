Yongge Wang (born 1967) is the full Professor at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.  He was the inventor of IEEE P1363 standards SRP5 and WANG-KE   and has contributed significantly to the understanding of mathematical randomness. He showed that a recursively enumerable real number is an algorithmically random sequence if and only if it is a Chaitin's constant. He also showed the separation  of Schnorr randomness from recursive randomness. He also invented a distance based statistical testing technique to improve NIST SP800-22 testing in randomness tests. In cryptographic research, he is known for the invention of the quantum resistant random linear code based encryption scheme RLCE.   He has also made significant contributions to other domains of cyber and network security.
