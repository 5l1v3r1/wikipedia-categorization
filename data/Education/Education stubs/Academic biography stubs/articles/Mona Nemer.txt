Mona Nemer, CM CQ FRSC (born c. 1957) is a Lebanese Canadian science professor specializing in cell research. Dr. Nemer received a PhD in bioorganic chemistry from McGill University. She served as Vice-President Research at the University of Ottawa from 2006-2017.  She was formerly a Professor of Pharmacology at the University of Montreal and the Director of the Cardiac Development Research Unit at the Institut de recherches cliniques de Montréal (IRCM) where she held a Tier 1 Canada Research Chair in Cardiovascular Cell Differentiation.     Nemer also served as Director of Academic Affairs and Executive Director of Planning and Development at IRCM. On September 26, 2017, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that after a selection process, Nemer was chosen as Canada's new Chief Science Advisor.   Nemer's research focuses on the understanding of the molecular mechanisms that register the genetic expression of cardiac cells.  She is best known for isolating genes that regulate ventricular hypertrophy which manifests itself in an increase volume of the heart and a thickening of the myocardial wall.   Her work has contributed to the development of diagnostic test diagnostic tests for heart failure and the genetics of cardiac birth defects.  Nemer has published over 150 scientific research articles to date, and trained over 100 students from Canada and other countries.
