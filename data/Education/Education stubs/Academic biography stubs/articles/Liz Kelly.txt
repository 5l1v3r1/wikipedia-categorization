  Elizabeth A. Kelly CBE (born 1951)  is the professor and director of the Child and Woman Abuse Studies Unit (CWASU), London Metropolitan University,  the former head of the, now defunct, Women's National Commission,  and co-chair, along with Marai Larasi, of the End Violence Against Women Coalition.  Kelly has written numerous papers and articles relating to violence against women and children, and has been a guest editor on the journal Child Abuse Review.  Her review of why so many alleged rapists go unprosecuted and unconvicted, which she conducted for the Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate, stated, "that at each stage of the legal process, stereotypes and prejudices play a part in decision-making".   In her book "The Hidden Gender of Law", Kelly argues "there is no clear distinction between consensual sex and rape, but a continuum of pressure, threat, coercion and force". She claims that all women experience sexual violence at some points in their lives.  Kelly's publication "Surviving Sexual Violence" defines sexual violence as including "any physical, visual, verbal or sexual act that is experienced by the woman or girl, at the time or later, as a threat, invasion or assault, that has the effect of hurting her or degrading her and/or takes away her ability to control". Such a definition was criticised by Wendy McElroy, describing it as "disastrously subjective" also noting "regret is not a benchmark of consent".   Kelly was awarded the CBE in the 2000 New Years Honours, for services to combating violence against women and children.
