Eric Schocket (1966 â€“ 2006) was an Associate Professor of American literature at Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts. He wrote primarily on issues of class. In Vanishing Moments: Class and American Literature (University of Michigan Press, 2006), Schocket examined the way in which class-conscious American literature (such as by Herman Melville, Rebecca Harding Davis, William Howells, and Langston Hughes) confronted and addressed the typical American denial of issues of social stratification. Schocket received his BA from the University of California, Berkeley, and his PhD in American Literature from Stanford University.  His other published articles include: After a months-long battle with leukemia, Eric Schocket died on September 3, 2006.
