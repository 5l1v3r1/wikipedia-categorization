Walter Warwick Sawyer (or W. W. Sawyer) (1911â€“2008) was a mathematician,  mathematics educator and author, who taught on several continents.    Walter Warwick Sawyer was born in St. Ives, Hunts, England on April 5, 1911.  He attended  Highgate School in London. He was an undergraduate at St. John's College, Cambridge, obtaining a BA in 1933 and specializing in quantum theory and relativity. He was an assistant lecturer in mathematics from 1933 to 1937 at University College, Dundee and from 1937 to 1944 at University of Manchester. From 1945 to 1947, he was the head of mathematics at Leicester College of Technology. In 1948 Sawyer became the first head of the mathematics department of what is now the University of Ghana. From 1951 to 1956, he was at Canterbury College (now the University of Canterbury in New Zealand). He left Canterbury College to become an associate professor at the University of Illinois, where he worked from winter 1957 through June 1958.  While there, he criticized the New Math movement, which included the people who had hired him. From 1958 to 1965, he was a professor of mathematics at Wesleyan University, where he edited Mathematics Student Journal.  In the fall of 1965 he became a professor at the University of Toronto, appointed to both the College of Education and the Department of Mathematics. He retired in 1976. Sawyer was the author of some 11 books.  He is probably best known for his semi-popular works Mathematician's Delight and Prelude to Mathematics.  Both of these have been  translated into many languages.   Mathematician's Delight was still in print 65 years after it was written.  Some mathematicians have credited these books with  helping to inspire their choice of a career.    Sawyer died on February 15, 2008, at the age of 96.  He is survived by a daughter.
