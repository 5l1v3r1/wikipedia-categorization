Serene J. Khader is an American moral and political philosopher and feminist theorist. She is Associate Professor and Jay Newman Chair in the Philosophy of Culture at Brooklyn College, City University of New York.  Her main areas of research are political philosophy, moral psychology, feminist philosophy, global justice and development ethics.  In April 2017 she was elected vice-president of the Human Development and Capabilities Association. Khader exposes the myth that microfinance programs empower women in the third world. Building on work by Marilyn Waring and other feminist theorists, she argues that women are not an under-tapped resource, but are in fact already over-utilised but that more must be done to recognise the unpaid work they already do rather than burdening them with further entrepreneurial responsibilities.    Khader has a BA in philosophy and international studies from the University of Oregon (2002) and a PhD in philosophy and a graduate certificate in women's studies from Stony Brook University (2008).
