Shirin Akiner (born 16 June 1943) is a Research Associate at  London University's School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS). She produced many scholarly works, particularly on Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, and is a member of editorial and advisory board of Journal of Central Asian and Caucasian Studies published by the U.S.A.K. In 2005, human rights groups, non-governmental organizations and the former British ambassador to Uzbekistan, Craig Murray, accused her of producing a biased and "propagandist" report on the Andijan massacre in Uzbekistan.  Murray called on Colin Bundy, the director of SOAS, to take action against her for allegedly promoting falsehoods, but the latter refused on the ground that Murray's views were "unsubstantiated".
