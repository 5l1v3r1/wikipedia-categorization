Eduardo Joel Fabio Barraclough Valls (born 1923)  is an Anglo-Spanish academic noted for his connection to police in apartheid South Africa.  Barraclough was born in Madrid to a Spanish mother and Yorkshire father who founded Madrid's Chamber of Commerce and of a Catalan mother.   He moved to London with his family in the 1930s as a refugee from Francoist Spain.  He taught fine art and sculpture at Rugby School, where colleagues considered him "highly entertaining, a most unorthodox and highly gifted" teacher.  He established himself during the 1960s and early 1970s as an authority on sculpture, publishing in academic journals   and becoming a member of the Royal British Society of Sculptors.  In 1974, Barraclough was appointed to a three-year contract as professor of fine arts at the University of the Witwatersrand.   some colleagues there did not think well of his work, and he was transferred to a job at an associated gallery.  In 2000, it was revealed that Barraclough, while outwardly living the life of anti-apartheid activist since the 1970s, had been a paid informant of the South African  state security police.   The media was used to promote his image as a "brilliant, liberal artist with apparently impeccable credentials" in order to gain public trust, while he was funneling money from anti-apartheid groups to the police.
