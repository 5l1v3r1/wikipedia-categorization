Sir Samuel Phillips Bedson, FRS (1 December 1886 - 11 May 1969) was a British microbiologist who was Professor Emeritus of bacteriology at the University of London.  Bedson was born in Newcastle upon Tyne, the son of Peter Phillip Bedson, a professor of chemistry at the University of Durham, and was educated at Abbotsholme School in Derbyshire. From there he went to Armstrong College, Newcastle upon Tyne, where he graduated B.Sc in 1907. In 1912 he was awarded MB BS by the University of Durham. He then studied microbiology at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. Bedson started work studying blood platelets at the Lister Institute, but when World War I started, he enlisted in the Northumberland Fusiliers, was wounded at Gallipoli and evacuated home. In 1916 he was in France serving as a pathologist for the Royal Army Medical Corps. After the war he eventually resumed his work on platelets at the Lister Institute. In 1924 he transferred to the study of Foot-and-mouth disease and in 1926 was awarded a Freedom Fellowship to study viruses at London Hospital, which in 1929 included a study of psittacosis. The causal micro-organisms Chlamydophila psittaci of psittacosis were known, from the 1930s to the 1960s, as Bedsoniae as a result of his research. In 1934 he was appointed to the Goldsmiths Companyâ€™s Chair of Bacteriology at the London Hospital Medical College, from which he retired in 1952. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1935   and was knighted in 1956.  He married Dorothea Annie, the elder daughter of Henry Hoffert, a senior inspector of schools for the Board of Education. They had three sons, one of whom was the head of the Microbiology Department at the University of Birmingham Medical School.  After his retirement, he ran the virus unit of the British Empire Cancer Campaign in the Bland Sutton Institute of Pathology at the Middlesex Hospital until 1962.
