He served as president of Wyoming Catholic College from 2013 to 2016 when he accepted his position as executive vice president of the Texas Public Policy Foundation. During his tenure as President of Wyoming Catholic College, Roberts led the institution to an outright rejection of Title IV federal student loans and grants, citing religious liberty concerns.

In an article on the decision, The New York Times described Roberts and his students as "cowboy Catholics" for their independence.
