He is also the director of the International Center on Big Data at Beihang University , and the director of the Huawei-Edinburgh Joint Lab for Distributed Data Management and Processing.     Fan was educated at Peking University (BS, MS) and the University of Pennsylvania where he was awarded a PhD in Computer Science for research supervised by Peter Buneman and Scott Weinstein in 1999.  Fan has made fundamental contributions to both theory and practice of data management.  He has both formalised the problems of querying big data and has developed radically new techniques that overcome the limits associated with conventional database systems.  His work has been adopted in the telecommunications industry for analyzing massive data sets that defied their current technology.  In addition, Wenfei has made seminal contributions to data quality, in which he devised new techniques for data cleaning that have found wide commercial adoption.  He has also contributed to our  understanding of semi-structured data.  Fan won the Roger Needham Award in 2008 and is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). , and a member of Academia Europaea (MAE).  and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in May 2018.   “All text published under the heading 'Biography' on Fellow profile pages is available under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.” --Royal Society Terms, conditions and policies at the Wayback Machine (archived 2016-11-11)  This article incorporates text available under the CC BY 4.0 license.
