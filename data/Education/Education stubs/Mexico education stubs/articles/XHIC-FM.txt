Coordinates: 19°50′34″N 90°32′24″W﻿ / ﻿19.84278°N 90.54000°W﻿ / 19.84278; -90.54000 XHIC-FM is a Mexican college radio station owned by the Instituto Campechano and located in Campeche, Campeche. It formerly broadcast on AM as XEIC-AM 810, which came to air in September 1997 running test transmissions on 1580 kHz and then received its permit and moved to 810 in 1998. In 2010, the station received its authorization to move to FM.  The FM station launched in 2015. XHIC does not appear in the most recent IFT table release, dated March 31, 2016, likely because it failed to apply to transition to a public or social use concession.
