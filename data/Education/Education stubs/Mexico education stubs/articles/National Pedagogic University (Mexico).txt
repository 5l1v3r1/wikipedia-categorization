The National Pedagogic University (Spanish: Universidad Pedagógica Nacional - UPN) is Mexico's national university for teacher training. The main campus, directly adjacent to the Colegio de México in Mexico City, hosts more than 5,000 students and is the largest of more than 70 UPN campuses nationwide. The university offers both undergraduate (licenciatura) and graduate programs of study. UPN is in the process of being separated from the Secretaría de Educación Pública and becoming autonomous.
