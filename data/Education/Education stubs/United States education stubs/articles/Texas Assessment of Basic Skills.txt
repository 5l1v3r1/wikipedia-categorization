The Texas Assessment of Basic Skills or TABS test was a standardized test for public schools in the State of Texas beginning in 1980. It was introduced by statute by the 66th Legislature in 1979. The statute required testing of "basic skills competencies in mathematics, reading, and writing for grades 3, 5, and 9."
