The Center for Data-Driven Discovery   is a multi-division research group at the California Institute of Technology, focusing on the methodologies for handling and analysis of large and complex data sets, facilitating the data-to-discovery process. It supports all applications of data-driven computing in various scientific domains, such as biology, physics, astronomy, geophysics, etc.  It also functions as a catalyst for new collaborations and projects between different scientific disciplines, and between the campus and JPL, with especial interest in the sharing and transfer of methodologies, where the solutions from one field can be reapplied in another one. The Center for Data-Driven Discovery is a part of a joint initiative with the Center for Data Science and Technology at JPL.  It became operational Fall 2014.  Also known as CD(cube).
