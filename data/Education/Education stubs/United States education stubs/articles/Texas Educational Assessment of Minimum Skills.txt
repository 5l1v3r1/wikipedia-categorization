The Texas Educational Assessment of Minimum Skills or TEAMS was the second standardized test used in Texas, from 1984 until 1990. It was used for grades 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11. If the student passed, he or she no longer needed to take the exam. Passing the Grade 11, or Exit level, examination was required for graduation, but many opportunities for retesting were available. The TEAMS exam was replaced by the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills (TAAS) in 1990.
