Excelsior College Examinations (or ECE) are a series of tests offered by Excelsior College in New York. Many colleges and universities will grant college credits for each test, although they are not as widely accepted as CLEP and DSST.  As of 2013, ECE credit can be transferred to more than 2,500 accredited colleges across the U.S. The exam administration period is 3 hours and the tests currently cost between $235 and $335, although military personnel may take them free of charge on many installations. Each exam usually corresponds to a one or two semester introductory or secondary course on the topic, and many provide upper-division credit.  Most ECE exams are considered equivalent to 3 credits in the semester system. ECE exams are offered through Excelsior College and are administered at Pearson VUE test centers, as well as most military installations.
