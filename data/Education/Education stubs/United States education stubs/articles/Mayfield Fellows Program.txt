The Mayfield Fellows Program is a university program that offers students in-depth training and experience in high-tech entrepreneurship. The program, originally called the "Technology Ventures Co-op" was founded in 1996 at Stanford University and expanded in 2001 to include the University of California, Berkeley.  The two programs each have a slightly different focus.  At Stanford, the students are juniors, senior, and co-terminal masters students, primarily in engineering and science.  At Berkeley, the students are generally graduate students in business or engineering. The students benefit from doing case studies in the classroom, interning at high-tech startup companies, and meeting with senior-level mentors from those companies in the industry. At Stanford University, the Mayfield Fellows Program (MFP) offers an unparalleled opportunity for students to develop theoretical understanding, practical knowledge and leadership skills needed for starting and growing technology companies. Each year 12 students are selected to participate in this nine-month program, combining a sequence of courses, mentoring and networking activities, and a paid internship at a Silicon Valley startup. The students enter a program that covers marketing, strategy, finance, ethics and leadership. The student Fellows are later introduced to various VC firms' portfolio companies for a summer internship.  http://stvp.stanford.edu/mayfield-fellows-program/
