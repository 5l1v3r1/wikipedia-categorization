The Washington Student Achievement Council (WSAC) is the state agency overseeing higher education and student success in the state of Washington. It consists of a nine-member citizen board and an associated cabinet-level agency.   The agency was created on July 1, 2012 when its duties were transferred from the former Washington State Higher Education Coordinating Board with the passage and enactment of HB 2483.
