Its founding were largely through the efforts of William B. Ball, who would later serve as president. The school's first president was David Abner Jr., a position he served until 1905.  The school's main building was destroyed by a fire in 1936.  A fundraising drive was called off in 1937 and the school largely ceased operations.
