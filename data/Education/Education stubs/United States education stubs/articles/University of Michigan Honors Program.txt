The University of Michigan Honors Program at the University of Michigan is a four-year program that provides a rich and challenging set of academic offerings to students within the College of LS&A. By providing interdisciplinary Honors courses across almost every department and an intellectual community including Honors faculty fellows and research, the program "enables students to identify their intellectual interests and to pursue them deeply."  The Perlman Honors Commons, an intellectual hub, houses the program in Mason Hall. Students admitted to the program may also choose to live in South Quad. Students are admitted prior to their freshmen year and complete their first two years in the program. They then may reapply to graduate with Honors, which entails writing a thesis.
