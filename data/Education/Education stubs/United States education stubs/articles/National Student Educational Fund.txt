The National Student Educational Fund (NSEF) was founded in the 1970s in Washington, D.C. as a non-profit research group. Founder Layton Olson created the group using staff from the National Student Lobby (NSL) and the National Student Association (NSA). NSEF issued several reports and books on issues related to students and post-secondary education. Later, after NSA and NSL merged into the United States Student Association (USSA), NSEF was absorbed into USSA.
