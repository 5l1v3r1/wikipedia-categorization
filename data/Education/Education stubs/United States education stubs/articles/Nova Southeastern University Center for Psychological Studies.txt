The College of Psychology at Nova Southeastern University was organized in 1967 and is located in the Maxwell Maltz Building on NSU's main campus in Davie, Florida. It serves to provide education to current and future psychologists and counseling professionals through training that provides individuals with an understanding of psychological research and the proper delivery of mental health care. Prior to a 2015 university-wide reorganization, the college was known as the Center for Psychological Studies. The reorganization brought in several undergraduate and graduate programs that were previously part of the Farquhar College of Arts and Sciences.  The college offers a number of bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees in the mental health field. The college is home to several clinics which provide psychological services to the Ft. Lauderdale area. These clinics run from an ADHD assessment clinic to a family violence program and are open to the general public.  There are a number of student organizations which have been established at the college. They include the Student Government Association, Gay Straight Student Association, Counseling Student Organization, and Students United for Returning Veterans. Membership in student organizations is open to all students of the college.
