School redistricting is the process of changing school attendance zones within a school district. This is necessary when attendance zones have grown (or occasionally shrunk) disproportionately to the occupancy capacity of the schools in the district.  This always occurs when a new school is built or one is closed, but may also occur due to other shifts in population.  These districts are necessary not only to balance enrollment, but also to coordinate school bus routes. Separate maps are usually kept for each level (elementary school, middle, and high school in many United States school districts). This is not an inherently political process, however parents can become very upset when their children are moved from a school they like (or to one they don't), and occasionally elected school boards have been forced to change plans after protest. Even those without school-age children may take an interest in school redistricting, as it is perceived to affect the resale value of a home.
