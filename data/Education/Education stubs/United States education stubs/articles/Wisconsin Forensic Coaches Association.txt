The Wisconsin Forensics Coaches Association (WFCA) is one of two forensics leagues in the state. Although the WFCA was founded after the Wisconsin High School Forensics Association, its 40 years of existence have been highly successful.  Although national forensic circuit competition includes both debate and individual events, competition in Wisconsin is split.  Debate events in Wisconsin are sponsored by the Wisconsin Debate Coaches Association. The organization is engaged in governing categories, sanctioning invitational tournaments, and coach education. The main organizational endeavor of the WFCA is the State Tournament, held mid-April annually. The organization celebrated its 40th anniversary during the 2010 season. Traditionally, the tournament was held at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Oshkosh, but starting in 2005, Ripon College has hosted. The WFCA currently sanctions 19 events, of which Impromptu is almost always offered as consolation event, if at all.  The events include both Speech and Interpretation events. Speech events feature a student-composed original speech with research, opinions, arguments, etc. Interpretations are presentations adapted from literary works of drama, literature, and poetry.  The WFCA requires that some works must be published in some events, while original material is permissible in events such as Poetry and Prose.
