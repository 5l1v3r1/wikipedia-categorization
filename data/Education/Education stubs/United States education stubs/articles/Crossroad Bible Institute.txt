Crossroad Bible Institute (CBI) provides faith-based reentry education for people in prison in the United States. CBI offers educational courses on three levels.  The group's Center for Advanced Studies houses CBI's prison reentry program that connects those who have been in prison with reentry agencies in the area of their anticipated release to assist them in finding a job, securing housing and, if desired, locating a church. Crossroad Bible Institute sponsors a weekly radio program, Crossroad Connection, as a voice for restorative justice.
