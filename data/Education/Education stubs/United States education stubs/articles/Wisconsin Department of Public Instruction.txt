The Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction, headquartered in Madison, is the state education and public library management agency in the state of Wisconsin.  The department is led by the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, a non-partisan, constitutional officer elected every four years in the spring primary, six months after the previous year's presidential election.  Tony Evers was elected state superintendent in 2009, and has since been re-elected twice, in 2013 and 2017.  Supported by public tax levies and the free school movement, public school attendance in Wisconsin has increased from 14,000 students in 1846  to 870,470 students in the 2011-2012 school year.
