Rutgers Agricultural Field Day is a farm-oriented event held at Rutgers University's Cook Campus in New Brunswick, New Jersey, United States, on the last Saturday of April.  The event includes 4-H animal fairs, farm tours, plant sales, and department-specific exhibits such as the entomology department's cockroach races. The event is also known for BBQs and student parties, at which attendance peaked well over 20,000 people.  It—and the New Jersey Folk Festival on the adjoining Douglass campus—still attract over 10,000 people annually. Started in 1906, "Ag Field Day" began as a way for farmers to learn about the NJ Agricultural Experiment Station's studies. It expanded to lectures, demonstrations and tours in 1917, and was later embraced by students as a party focal-point. By the mid-90s, university administration scaled back the evening party atmosphere to decrease attendance by non-students and curb underage drinking. The event's daytime activities continue unabated, and are open to all.
