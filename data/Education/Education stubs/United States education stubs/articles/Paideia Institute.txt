The Paideia Institute for Humanistic Study is a non-profit educational organization, focused on promoting study and appreciation of classical languages. The institute was founded in 2010 by former students of Fr. Reginald Foster, a longtime Vatican Latinist who taught many generations of classicists in Rome.    The institute is headquartered in New York but runs programs in Italy, France, Greece, and the United States. Among the other programs of the Institute, Paideia has engaged in outreach efforts for classicists working outside of academia in its "Legion Project," and offers outreach programs to elementary and middle school students (with a special focus on socioeconimcally disadvantaged students) at sites in New York including Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx, as well as in Philadelphia and Port Chester. In 2015, Paideia won the Society for Classical Studies' President's Award for its "work in significantly advancing public appreciation and awareness of classical antiquity."
