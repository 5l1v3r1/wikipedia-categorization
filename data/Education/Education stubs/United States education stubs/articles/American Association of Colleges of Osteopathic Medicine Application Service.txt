The American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine Application Service (AACOMAS) is a service run by the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine through which prospective osteopathic medical students can apply to osteopathic medical schools in the United States that grant the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine degree.  Medical schools in the United States that grant the Doctor of Medicine degree use either the American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS) or the Texas Medical & Dental Schools Application Service (TMDSAS). The University of North Texas is the only osteopathic medical school that does not use AACOMAS.
