The National Center for Engineering and Technology Education is a partnership of four land-grant research universities (Utah State University, the University of Minnesota, the University of Illinois and the University of Georgia), five technology teacher education universities (Brigham Young University, California State University at Los Angeles, University of Wisconsinâ€“Stout, Illinois State University and North Carolina A&T State University) and fifteen K-12 school districts. The center was funded by the National Science Foundation in 2004 under NSF program award 0426421.
