The Florida Board of Control (1905-1965) was the statewide governing body for the State University System of Florida, which included all public universities in the state of Florida. It was replaced by the Florida Board of Regents in 1965.  The Florida Board of Control was created by the 1905 legislation known as the Buckman Act. The act reorganized Florida's public higher education system into three institutions, segregated by race and gender, as follows:  The gender separation aspect of the Buckman Act was overturned by the Florida Legislature in 1947 when Florida State University was returned to coeducational status and the University of Florida was made coeducational.  The Legislature also determined it necessary to make room for the World War II veterans who wished to use the GI Bill of Rights to pursue their educational endeavors.  While the racial segregation aspect of the Buckman Act was overturned by the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Florida State University and the University of Florida began accepting African American undergraduates in 1961-1962.  The State Normal College for Colored Students changed their name to Florida Agricultural and Mechanical College for Negroes in 1909, and in 1953 the name was again changed to Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University.
