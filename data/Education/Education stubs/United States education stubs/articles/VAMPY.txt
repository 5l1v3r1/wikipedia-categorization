VAMPY is the Summer Program for Verbally and Mathematically Precocious Youth, a three-week residential summer camp offered through The Center for Gifted Studies at Western Kentucky University for students finishing the 7th through 10th grades. The camp is affiliated with the Duke University Talent Identification Program. The dates for VAMPY 2013 were June 23 - July 13. To qualify for VAMPY, students must take the SAT or ACT in 7th grade and score above average (typically 520 or above on an SAT section, or 20 or above on an ACT section).  At VAMPY, students sign up for one class, and study it for the duration of the three-week period. Classes are held for 7 hours per day, which includes a 1-hour study period. Food and dorms are provided in the fees for the camp. Students partake in a variety of other athletic, academic, and recreational activities in addition to their classes. The camp is overseen by Dr. Julia Link Roberts, who has run the program since its beginning in 1983. VAMPY, along with the SCATS camp for 5th-7th grade students, helped expand Western Kentucky University's Center for Gifted Studies. This eventually led to the establishment of the Gatton Academy in 2007.
