The National Association of State Boards of Education (NASBE) is a nonprofit, private association that represents U.S. state and territorial boards of education. Founded in 1958, the association initially met in conjunction with the annual conference of the National School Boards Association, but by 1960 the group was meeting on its own and had an office in Denver, Colorado. The association's principal objectives, stated in the bylaws, are to strengthen state leadership in education policy-making; promote excellence in the education of all students; advocate equality of access to educational opportunity; and assure responsible lay governance of public education.  Today NASBE is headquartered in Alexandria, Virginia,.
