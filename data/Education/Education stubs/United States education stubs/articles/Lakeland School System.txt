The Lakeland School System (LSS) is a municipal school district in Lakeland, Tennessee in Greater Memphis. Lakeland Elementary School is within the district.  In December 2013 the district selected as its superintendent Dr. Ted Horrell, the principal of Germantown High School,  and a former principal of Millington Central High School.  As of January 2014 the school district established a survey on Surveymonkey to gauge parental attitudes on several issues. As of that year, the residents are served by Shelby County Schools with elementary students attending Lakeland Elementary School and more than 1,200 students from Lakeland in higher grades attending campuses in Arlington and Bartlett.  Lakeland Middle Preparatory School is being built on 94 acres of land located northeast of Highway 70 and Canada Road. The school, which will serve grades 5-8, is expected to open for the 2017-2018 school year. In early 2014, some residents of the Bolton community sought annexation with Lakeland, partly so the unincorporated area could join a municipal school district. Bolton includes Barret's Chapel Elementary School and Bolton High School.  The vote for annexation went before the Lakeland City Board on June 12, 2014 and failed. One resident of the community told the Board that "10 times more residents have petitioned you not to annex than have petitioned you to annex."  Lakeland Elementary, 20-acre (8.1Â ha), opened in 2001 as a school within Shelby County Schools. It has a capacity of 1,000 students. Lela Garlington of the Memphis Commercial Appeal stated that the school "could have roughly 820 or so students for its kindergarten to fifth-grade classes."  Lakeland Middle Preparatory School is scheduled to open in the Fall of 2017 under the leadership of its first principal, Mr. Matt Adler.
