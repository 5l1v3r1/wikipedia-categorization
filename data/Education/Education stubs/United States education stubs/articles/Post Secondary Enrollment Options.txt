Post Secondary Enrollment Options (PSEO) is an academic option open to high school seniors and juniors in various US states, such as Minnesota, and Ohio.  The options allow students to take courses at the college level. It is possible for a student to graduate with both an associate's degree and a high school diploma at the same time via PSEO. The PSEO program was created in 1985 by Minnesota, and later adopted by Ohio's Department of Education.  In Minnesota juniors (11th graders) are required to be in the top one-third of their class to be in PSEO. Seniors (12th graders) are required to be in the top half of their class to be eligible for PSEO.  In 2004 over 17,000 Minnesota High School students took PSEO classes.  In Ohio, PSEO was actually known as PSEOP, for Post Secondary Enrollment Options Program.  It was enacted in 1989 for 11th and 12th graders. Then, in 1997, the grades were expanded to include 9th and 10th graders. Because of this, the number of students in the PSEOP almost quadrupled in size, with over 12,000 students attending in 2008.  It was replaced by College Credit Plus in the 2015-16 school year.
