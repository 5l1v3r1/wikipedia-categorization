The Hodson Trust Scholarship is a four-year merit-based scholarship offered to roughly 20 incoming freshmen at Johns Hopkins University each year. The scholarship is given for "academic and personal achievement, leadership, and contribution" and provides $30,500 a year, if the recipient keeps a GPA of 3.0 or above.  Students who receive the scholarship are automatically chosen from the applicant pool â€“ no outside application is needed. The scholars are selected yearly from a pool of over 16,000 applicants to the university.  The scholarship is funded by the Hodson Trust, which also heavily donates to Johns Hopkins University and funds scholarships for other Maryland schools.  The Hodson Trust has given the university over $72 million since 1958.   Describing the value of the Trust, Bill Conley, the Dean of Enrollment and Services for Johns Hopkins University, has said: The scholarship has been a topic of debate at times in the student community.
