Aerospace Education Services Project (AESP) is a NASA education project which delivers science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) professional development to K-12, pre-service, and informal educators. The project has education specialists working at all of the NASA centers across the U.S. These educators work with schools and other organizations in order to deliver professional learning opportunities through both face-to-face and virtual venues. The project is managed by Kyle Peck, Principal Investigator, Peggy Maher, Director and Dan Cherry, NASA Project Manager at the Langley Research Center. Robots on the Road (ROTR) is an educational program run by traveling NASA specialists in middle schools across the country. Students in grades 5-8 work in groups in order to determine what their robot is designed to do, and how it uses its motors and sensors to achieve those goals. The robots used in this program are made from Lego Mindstorms kits, and are analogous to existing NASA robots.
