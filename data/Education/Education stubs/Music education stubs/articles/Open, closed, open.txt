Open, closed, open is a technique of playing snare drum rudiments, especially used during auditions.   Open, closed, open technique consists of beginning the rudiment very slow and controlled, speeding up evenly until at the maximum speed for the drummer, then slowing back down after maintaining that speed. Optimally, the drummer should end on the opposite hand as started, in case of alternating rudiments such as paradiddles. Also, the speed ended at should be approximately the same speed as the drummer began.
