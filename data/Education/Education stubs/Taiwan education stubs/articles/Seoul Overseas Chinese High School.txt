Seoul Overseas Chinese High School  or Hanseong Chinese Middle and High School  (traditional Chinese: 韓國漢城華僑中學; simplified Chinese: 韩国汉城华侨中学; pinyin: Hánguó Hànchéng Huáqiáo Zhōngxué; Korean: 한국한성화교중고등학교)  is a Republic of China (Taiwan)-oriented Chinese international junior and senior high school in Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, South Korea.  It follows the curriculum of the ROC,  and accordingly uses textbooks from Taiwan.  It is a hwagyo, or an ethnic Chinese school in South Korea. The South Korean government began recognizing hwagyo as educational institutions in 1998.  The area primary school serving Chinese students is Seoul Chinese Primary School in Jung-gu. The school opened as the Kwanghwa Middle School in 1942. It temporarily closed in 1945 stemming from the fallout from World War II, but with help from Republic of China officials it reopened in 1948 on the property of the Republic of China Embassy.  Sun Shu-i became the principal in 1984 and discontinued tracking students into classes A, B, and C.  As of  2003[update], the school had 1,100 students. About half of the families of the students made their living as owners or employees of Chinese restaurants.  The school has painting and Chinese calligraphy classes.
