This template is used to identify a stub relating to education in Taiwan. It uses {{asbox}}, which is a meta-template designed to ease the process of creating and maintaining stub templates. Typing {{Taiwan-edu-stub}} produces the message shown at the beginning, and adds the article to the following category: This is a stub template. A brief explanation of these templates follows; for full details please consult Wikipedia:Stub.  A stub is an article containing only a few sentences of text which is too short to provide encyclopedic coverage of a subject. Further information can be found at: New stub templates and categories (collectively "stub types") should not be created without prior proposal at Wikipedia:WikiProject Stub sorting/Proposals. This allows for the proper coordination of all stub types across Wikipedia, and for the checking of any new stub type for possible problems prior to its creation.
