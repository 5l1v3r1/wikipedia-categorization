Toyoma Education Museum exhibits the history of education in Japan since the Meiji period. It is housed in the former Tome Elementary School Building (旧登米高等尋常小学校校舎) of 1888 in the city of Tome, Miyagi Prefecture. The U-shaped two-storey building around a courtyard, lined with balconies and with half-hexagons at the end of each wing, was designed by Kisaburo Yamazoe. It is representative of the western-inspired architecture of the Meiji period and in 1981 was designated an Important Cultural Property.      (in Japanese) Toyoma Education Museum homepage
