Economic and Public Affairs (EPA) is a subject taught in the junior forms of most secondary schools in Hong Kong, either as a separate subject or as a component of combined humanities or combined social studies. The subject is concerned with helping students to develop a basic understanding of economic and political issues, of the economic and political foundations of Hong Kong society, and of their responsibilities and rights as citizens and consumers. In many ways, it is similar to Civics courses which are taught in many other countries, but the syllabus content is almost entirely related to local Hong Kong topics. Topics covered in the EPA syllabus include the following: Form One: Form Two: Form Three: After studying EPA in Forms One to Three, students who wish to continue exploring the themes covered by the subject can opt to study Economics and Public Affairs and Government and Public Affairs for their HKCEE and HKALE examinations, and to complete the Liberal studies later in Forms Four to Six for the HKDSE (Some secondary school start it earlier - At Form One or Form Two.)
