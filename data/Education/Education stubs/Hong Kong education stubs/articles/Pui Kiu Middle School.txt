  Pui Kiu Middle School (Chinese: 培僑中學) is a pro-Chinese Central Government   secondary school in Hong Kong. Located in the Eastern District area of North Point, it has attracted controversy. The school uses Chinese language as a medium of instruction. The school was founded in 1946 by overseas Chinese investors from Southeast Asia and elsewhere, originally in Pui Kiu Lang Park (around Happy Valley to the Mid-Levels area). In the 1980s it relocated to its current location in Braemar Hill.  When the People's Republic of China was established in 1949, the school announced that it would uphold Communist disciplines in its curriculum. This placed a severe strain on relations between the school and the colonial Hong Kong government, as well as with the local population, whose political opinion tended towards anti-communism. In the late 1970s, the Hong Kong government, under the education laws, took over the school and reorganized it. Currently, Pui Kiu Middle School is part of the Direct Subsidy Scheme. The campus features a swimming pool, student dormitories, laboratories, computer rooms, classrooms, an indoor dining hall, an auditorium, a library and an indoor stadium.
