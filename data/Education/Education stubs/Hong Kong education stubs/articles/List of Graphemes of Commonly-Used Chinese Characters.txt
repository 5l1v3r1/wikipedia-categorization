The List of Graphemes of Commonly-used Chinese Characters (Chinese: 常用字字形表; Jyutping: soeng4 jung6 zi6 zi6 jing4 biu2) is a list of 4762 commonly used Chinese characters and their standardized forms prescribed by the Hong Kong Education Bureau to be taught in primary and Middle schools in Hong Kong. The list was last updated in 2007, included as an appendix to the Hong Kong Chinese Lexical Lists for Primary Learning (Chinese: 香港小學學習字詞表; Jyutping: hoeng1 gong2 siu2 hok6 hok6 zaap6 zi6 ci4 biu2). In 2012, the list was published as a hardcover book, with Cantonese and Putonghua pronunciations and simple English explanations for every character.
