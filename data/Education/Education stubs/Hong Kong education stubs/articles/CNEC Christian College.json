The council composes of the Executive Committee and the representatives of all student organizations in the college. The role of student council is to be the bridge between the school and students. The council is obliged to serve both students and school authority by establishing a harmonious and effective learning environment.\nThe election of student council has been changed from the individual system to cabinet since 2014. The first elected cabinet is Stardust with 10 members. \nThe chairman of the council is also the one who holds and calls general meetings. General meeting is an official occasion that allows student bodies, including four houses, different clubs and society, to initiate and report events planned to be held. The initiations will be questioned in the course by council members and participated teachers. Approval or disapproval for the initiation of events is given after the polling of student body representatives.  \n</p><p>Advising teachers will have a regular internal meeting with the student council executive members every month to keep updated with the operations of council and advise the initiated events held by council executives.\n</p><p>Some claim that this makes the advisors the authentically supreme leader of the council. They insist that advising teachers often unconstitutionally speak in the council and sometimes stop the hon. Councilors make statements therein as he might deem fit even though he assumes no seat in the council pursuant to the constitution. After all, the council executives committee members are those with the power to make the decisions but not the advisors. The dispute over who takes the lead in council is yet to be discussed.\n</p><p>Significant events held by Student Council are Singing Contest and the Variety Show. For the former event, it is an annual big activity for all students to participate. It is a platform for those who are interested in singing and dancing to showcase their talent. Participants in the forms of individuals, groups and class will undergo audition, semi-finals and finals to win the first place. The final is held usually with the variety show. Variety Show is hence an event composes of the final of singing contest and the talent shows of four houses, council members or members of clubs and societies. Besides, student Council is also responsible for Local Student Exchange Programme, Foreign Student Exchange Programme and daily stationary selling etc.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Public_exams\">Public exams</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=CNEC_Christian_College&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Public exams\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>CNECCC does exceedingly well in the field of Mathematics and Chemistry.
