St. George's School in Hong Kong opened in 1955 to serve the educational needs of the growing population of British armed forces personnel and civil servants in the colony. It closed in 1996 in preparation for the 1997 handover of Hong Kong. A new school, the Australian International School Hong Kong now sits partly on the Norfolk Road site vacated by the St. George's closure. The School operated a house system. It consisted of Balmoral, Osbourne, Sandringham and Windsor houses. There was originally a Buckingham house as well. Towards the last years of the school's existence, as the number of pupils dropped, Osbourne and Windsor houses were merged, the name Osbourne was kept with the red colour of Windsor.
