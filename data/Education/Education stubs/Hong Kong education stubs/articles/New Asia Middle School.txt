  New Asia Middle School (新亞中學) (NAMS) is an aided secondary school founded in 1973. It is located at Farm Road in Tokwawan. Its campus consists of four complexes : Block A with a library and the New Asia Institute inside, Block B, Block C and Block S (the Pillar). Heung Shu Fai (香樹輝), famous banker in Hong Kong, is the manager of the school. Also, Wat Kai Chau (屈啟秋) is the supervisor. In the 1970s, Yu Ying-shih (余英時), Chinese American historian known for his mastery of sources for Chinese history and philosophy, and Xun guo-dong (孫國棟), Chinese historian became committees of New Asia Middle School's Incorporated Management Committee. Purportedly, the school projects a bad image because of students' impolite behaviour. However, it has been trying hard to make improvements on the issue. As a result, it receives positive evaluation of polite behaviour from shop owners as well as the staff working in the vicinity.
