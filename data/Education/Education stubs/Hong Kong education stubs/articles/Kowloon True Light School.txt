  Kowloon True Light School (KTLS, Chinese: 九龍真光中學) is a Protestant girls' secondary school situated in Kowloon Tong, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China. It is supervised by The Hong Kong Council of the Church of Christ in China. On 16 June 1872, True Light School, a primary school, was founded in Guangzhou on the Chinese mainland by Harriet Newell Noyes, a missionary from the American Presbyterian Church. In 1917, the True Light Middle School was established in Guangzhou as a secondary section. In 1949, due to the communist takeover of Guangzhou, the school transferred to Hong Kong. It was finally relocated to the current site in 1960, with an affiliated primary school and kindergarten opened on its original campus on Waterloo Road. In 1990, the basketball court was demolished, in order to build a new annex. In addition, a six-story new building was completed in 2006. "You are the light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden. Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven." Matthew 5:14-16 (NIV) Ever since the establishment, True Light students have always been in light blue Cheongsam and plaits. They can choose to have a ponytail or two plaits since 2011. The Council began and have kept a 6-year cycle since 1994. Coordinates: 22°20′18″N 114°10′32″E﻿ / ﻿22.33837°N 114.17569°E﻿ / 22.33837; 114.17569
