  Be erudite in your studies and careful in thought Helen Liang Memorial Secondary School (Shatin) (梁文燕紀念中學(沙田)) is a secondary school in Sha Tin, Hong Kong, founded in 1988. The name of "Helen Liang Memorial Secondary School" was first implemented in 1977 by Mr. Liang Chang (梁昌), a businessman in Hong Kong, for the sake of commemorating his deceased wife, Mrs. Helen Liang (梁文燕). It was originally a government school  in Sheung Wan on Hong Kong Island, which later moved to Tai Wai, Sha Tin District in September 1988, and added the addendum  (Shatin) at the end of the name. Helen Liang Memorial Secondary School (Shatin) locates on a mound in Sha Tin, embraced by a verdant environment. Inside the school stands the outdoor theatre and curved flower path which is peculiar in Hong Kong. There are currently 28 standard classrooms with independent air-conditioning systems (simply it is just 2 air-conditioners per classroom), and includes a science laboratory, several computer rooms, a multi-media learning center, and a literature center. There are also a hall (which is like an auditorium but in Hong Kong style), a library, an outdoorbasketball court, an indoor playground with a small digital notice board, and an indoor cafeteria.
