The School of Law (Chinese: 法律學院) of City University of Hong Kong was founded in 1987, as the second law school in Hong Kong. The Department of Law was established in 1987, followed by the Department of Professional Legal Education in 1992. In March 1993, the two departments were brought together to merge as the Faculty of Law, and later renamed as the School of Law since the administrations of the two departments were unified. In 2002, a racial discrimination controversy took place, regarding the renewal of teaching staff members' contracts in the School of Law. The last dean of the School was Professor Wang Guiguo, an expert in Chinese law and international economic law, who retired from the position in 2013. The current acting dean is Professor Geraint Howells. The school has participated in various mooting competitions. Notably the school's team has been crowned as the champion of ICC Moot and Vis East in 2012, and also the winner of Willem C. Vis Moot in 2013.
