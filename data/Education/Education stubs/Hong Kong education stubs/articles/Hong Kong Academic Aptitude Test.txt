Hong Kong Academic Aptitude Test (HKAAT, Chinese: 香港學業能力測驗, commonly known as 學能測驗) was a standardized, area-wide benchmarking examination conducted by the Education Department. It was normally taken by students who finished primary six grade education in Hong Kong. It was cancelled in 2000. The test was designed to create a common ground in measuring different school systems, and began in 1978 as part of the Secondary School Places Allocation (SSPA) scheme. HKAAT aimed to test student logic, reasoning and classification ability.
