  Precious Blood Secondary School (Chinese: 寶血女子中學) is a girls' school in Chai Wan in Hong Kong. The principal is Sister Cheung (張淑婉修女).[when?] In 1945, after World War II, many children could not afford to go to school. As a result, the Sisters of the Precious Blood rented a place in Wan Chai as a school and named it Righteous Virtue Number 2 Female Secondary School (德貞第二女子中學), which was dependent on government subsidies. Seven years later, in 1952, it moved to North Point where the Sisters of the Precious Blood built a playground for it to commemorate Jesus Christ, and changed the name of the school to Precious Blood Secondary School.
