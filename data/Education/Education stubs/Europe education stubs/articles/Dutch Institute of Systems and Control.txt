The Dutch Institute of Systems and Control is an interuniversity institute and graduate school that unites nine university departments in the Netherlands active in systems and control theory and engineering.   The graduate school offers courses covering a wide range of topics from mathematical system theory to control engineering.   Completing the four-year program of the graduate school leads to a PhD degree awarded by one of the participating universities.   The Institute also unites all academic research in the Netherlands in the field of systems and control.  Examples of knowledge application are mechanical manipulation of hard-disk heads, developing energy-efficient greenhouses, designing cars that drive-by-wire, autonomously walking or flying robots, and operational strategies in process industry.
