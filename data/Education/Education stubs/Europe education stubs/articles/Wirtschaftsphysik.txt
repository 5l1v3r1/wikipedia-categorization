Wirtschaftsphysik is a relatively new course of studies, introduced at the University of Ulm in 1997. The name might be translated into English by Econophysics but it is questionable if both terms mean the same thing. It is composed of studies in Physics, Economics, Computer Science and Mathematics. In the first two years, the emphasis is on Physics and Mathematics but after the Bachelor Economics and Computer Science become more important. In comparison to regular physics students, Wirtschaftsphysik students have to participate in about half as many experiments in experimental physics and are only required to take three of the usual five lectures in Theoretical Physics.
