A school assembly is a gathering of all or part of a school for any variety of purposes, such as special programs or communicating information on a daily or weekly basis.     In some schools, students gather to perform a common song or prayer, and to receive common announcements.  A routine attendance check may also be done in such gatherings.  At larger schools, these morning rituals may be substituted by smaller classroom assemblies and announcements broadcast over a public address system.  Periodic school assemblies are also a forum for special presenters of educational, health, or safety materials, or for school plays, talent shows, etc. The act of morning assembly is not very new in gurukula. All the students were used to gather, meditate and discuss the daily routine in those assemblies. An act of collective gathering and worship is decided to make a part of the assembly in England and it became a legal requirement in schools after it.  A usual school assembly includes a prayer, news headline discussions from students, student talk and other important discussions.  However, it depends on the institution management. This activity is more popular in Indian continent. However, the trend is regularly growing in other parts of the world. Nowadays, Yoga and meditation are also becoming a part of school assemblies. Due to the number of students in a typical Chinese school, assemblies are normally held outdoors. It is common for the head of the school to address the entire student body for nearly an hour at the beginning of a school week or month.
