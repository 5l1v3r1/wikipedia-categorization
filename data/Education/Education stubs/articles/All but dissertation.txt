"All but dissertation" (ABD) is a term identifying a stage in the process of obtaining a research doctorate or a research-oriented master's degree in the United States and other countries. In typical usage of the term, the ABD graduate student has completed the required preparatory coursework, passed any required preliminary and comprehensive examinations, and met all other requirements except for the research requirements, typically including the writing and defense of a dissertation.  A student attaining this level may be granted a formal Candidate in Philosophy degree or status at a few institutions. Some universities, including Columbia, Yale, and George Washington, may award a formal Master of Philosophy (M.Phil. or MPhil) degree for these achievements.     The use of ABD or the similar PhD(c) for PhD candidate (also PhD-c or PhDc) as a credential has been criticized as potentially misleading by some writers as the terms are not widely understood outside of academia   or indeed outside of the USA.
