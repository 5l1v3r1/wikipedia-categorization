  Personal development planning is the process of creating an action plan based on awareness, values, reflection, goal-setting and planning for personal development within the context of a career, education, relationship or for self-improvement  . The PDP (personal development plan), also called an IDP (individual development plan) or a PEP (personal enterprise plan), usually includes a statement of one's  aspirations, strengths or competencies, education and training, and stages or steps to indicate how the plan is to be realized. Personal development plans may also include a statement of one's career and  lifestyle priorities, career positioning, analysis of opportunities and risks, and alternative plans (Plan B), and a curriculum vitae (CV). In higher education, personal development plans typically include a portfolio containing evidence of the skills gathered over a particular timeframe. It is presumed[by whom?] in education that undertaking PDPs will assist in creating self-directed independent learners who are more likely to progress to higher levels of academic attainment. Human-resource management also uses PDPs.  Personal development plans are often[quantify] a requirement for employee CVs. Employees who participate in business training are often asked[by whom?] to complete a personal development plan. An individual can often[quantify] develop a five-year personal development plan to organize personal goals and to make them achievable within a certain[which?] time-period.
