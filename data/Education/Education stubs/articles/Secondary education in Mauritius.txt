Secondary education in Mauritius commences after the completion of primary school. Secondary school in Mauritius is compulsory for all students of ages 12 to 16, and optional for students of ages 17 to 20. Secondary school typically lasts for seven years, termed as Form 1, Form 2, Form 3, Form 4, Form 5, Lower 6 Form, and Upper 6 Form. The Mauritius Examinations Syndicate, in conjunction with the University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate of the Cambridge International Examinations board, administers examinations for secondary school students. Secondary education to Form 3 level culminates in the sitting of the Form 3 National Exam. The O-level exams are taken at the end of Form 5, after which the School Certificate is awarded. The A-level exams are taken at the end of Lower 6 and Upper 6, at AS and A2 levels respectively, after which the Higher School Certificate (Mauritius) is awarded. The Higher School Certificate is the school leaving qualification awarded upon successful completion of secondary school, after which students may progress onto tertiary school study.
