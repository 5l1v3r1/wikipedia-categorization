Imitative learning is a type of social learning whereby new behaviors are acquired via imitation.   Imitation aids in communication, social interaction, and the ability to modulate one's emotions to account for the emotions of others, and is "essential for healthy sensorimotor development and social functioning".  The ability to match one's actions to those observed in others occurs in humans and animals;  imitative learning plays an important role in humans in cultural development.  On the most basic level, research performed by A.L. Saggerson, David N. George, and R.C. Honey showed that pigeons were able to learn a basic process that would lead to the delivery of a reward by watching a demonstrator pigeon.   A demonstrator pigeon was trained to peck a panel in response to one stimulus (e.g. a red light) and hop on the panel in response to a second stimulus (e.g. a green light).  After proficiency in this task was established in the demonstrator pigeon, other learner pigeons were placed in a video-monitored observation chamber.  After every second observed trial, these learner pigeons were then individually placed in the demonstrator pigeon's box and presented the same test.  The learner pigeons displayed competent performance on the task, and thus it was concluded that the learner pigeons had formed a response-outcome association while observing.  However, the researchers noted that an alternative interpretation of these results could be that the learner pigeons had instead acquired outcome-response associations that guided their behavior and that further testing was needed to establish if this was a valid alternative.
