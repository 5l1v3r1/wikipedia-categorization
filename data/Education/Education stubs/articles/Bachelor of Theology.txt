The Bachelor of Theology degree (BTh, ThB, or BTheol) is a three- to five-year undergraduate degree in theological disciplines.   Candidates for this degree typically must complete course work in Greek or Hebrew, as well as systematic theology, biblical theology, ethics, homiletics, hermeneutics and Christian ministry.  It does not require a thesis but is often a year longer than a Bachelor of Religious Education or Bachelor of Arts.  In some denominations, notably the Church of England, it is considered sufficient for formal ordination. In some schools, the BTh is a three-year degree for mature students pursuing ordination, who do not hold a degree and for whom the requirement of a Master of Divinity has been waived.
