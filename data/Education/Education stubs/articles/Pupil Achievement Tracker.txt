The Pupil Achievement Tracker (PAT) is a pupil tracking system produced by the DfES.  It allows schools and LEAs to import their own pupil performance data and compare it with national performance data. As part of the New Relationship with Schools, Ofsted and DfES are streamlining data analysis in schools by merging PANDA with PAT to produce new online product called RAISEOnline. Reporting and Analysis for Improvement through School Self-Evaluation (RAISE) RAISEonline  is a new web-based system which disseminates school performance data and will replace the current Ofsted Performance and Assessment (PANDA) reports and the DfES Pupil Achievement Tracker (PAT) in 2007 to coincide with the availability of 2006 validated National Curriculum data.
