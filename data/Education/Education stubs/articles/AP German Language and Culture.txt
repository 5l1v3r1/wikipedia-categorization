Advanced Placement German Language and Culture (also known as AP German Language and Culture, AP German Language or AP German) is a course and examination provided by the College Board through the Advanced Placement Program. This course  is designed to give high school students the opportunity to receive credit in a college-level German language course. It is generally taken in the fourth year of high school German study.

The grade distributions for the AP German Language and Culture exam since 2012 are:
