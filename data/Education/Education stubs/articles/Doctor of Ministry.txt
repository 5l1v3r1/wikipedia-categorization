The Doctor of Ministry (D.Min.) degree is a professional doctorate which may be earned by a minister of religion while concurrently engaged in some form of ministry.  Under Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada (ATS) standards, programs must require matriculants to have earned the degree Master of Divinity (M.Div.) or its equivalent  and to have engaged in no fewer than three years of full time ministry,  though some programs require more.  The ATS requires students to complete at least one year of coursework followed by the completion of the doctoral dissertation or research project.  Normally, the degree requires between three and six years to complete.  The degree's purpose is to "enhance the practice of ministry for persons who hold the MDiv or its educational equivalent and who have engaged in substantial ministerial leadership."  As such, Doctor of Ministry concentrations vary by institution and include applied theology, evangelism, pastoral counseling or the psychology of religion, homiletics, spiritual formation, ethics, church growth, church leadership, and apologetics.
