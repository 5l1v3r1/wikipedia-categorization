The Form III Certificate is an academic qualification in Mauritius awarded upon successful completion of lower secondary school.  The qualification is awarded upon earning passing marks on the National Assessment at Form III exams, taken at Form III in secondary school, which are administered by the Mauritius Examinations Syndicate.  Form III marks the end of compulsory education, and students are not obligated to continue their studies beyond this point. Form III also marks the completion of lower secondary education. Students who successfully earn the Form III Certificate may then progress onto higher secondary education. They may then study for the O-level examinations and earn the School Certificate. Students who are unsuccessful in obtaining the qualification may then transition from the academic stream to the vocational stream and progress onto vocational programmes of study.
