Quamut is a collection of how-to guides launched in March 2008 by the bookstore chain Barnes & Noble. The core line of guides are all editorially written but there is also a section of user-contributed wiki guides. Quamut is the Latin for "how-to" and is pronounced kw√≥mut. Like its competitors  Google Knol, Squidoo, and WikiAnswers, it generates revenue by the placement of relevant advertisement using Google's AdSense program. Additionally, Quamut guides are sold online as PDFs, and a selection are available for purchase as laminated charts in Barnes & Noble stores and from bn.com. In August, 2009 Barnes & Noble shut down Quamut, though the print charts continue to be available.
