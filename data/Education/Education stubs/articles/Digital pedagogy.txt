Digital pedagogy is the study and use of contemporary digital technologies in teaching and learning.  Digital pedagogy may be applied to online, hybrid, and face-to-face learning environments. Digital pedagogy values open education, including open educational resources; sharing syllabi; sharing teaching resources through tools such as GitHub and Creative Commons; self-directed interest based student project, and publishing using open access and open peer review. Digital Pedagogy is not only about using digital technologies for teaching and learning but rather approaching digital tools from a critical pedagogical perspective. So, it is as much about using digital tools thoughtfully as it is about deciding when not to use digital tools, and about paying attention to the impact of digital tools on learning.
