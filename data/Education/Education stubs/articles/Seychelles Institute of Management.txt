Seychelles Institute of Management or "SIM" was started in 1978 by Guy Morel and Graham Jones (A British Chartered Accountant working for Guy at the time as part of British Aid). Mr. Jones had been selected for a job in Seychelles working for Mr. Morel. The original aim had been to train local Seselois (Seychellois) working for the finance ministry to become chartered accountants to sit and pass their exams in Seychelles. The program had been working very well with more students than places. Mr. Morel and Mr. Jones came up with the idea over drinks about starting a more permanent school. Characteristically of Mr. Morel (very much a do-er) once convinced he simply said lets do it.
