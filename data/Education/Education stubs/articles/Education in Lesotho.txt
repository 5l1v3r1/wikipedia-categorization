Education in Lesotho has undergone reforms in recent years,[when?] meaning that primary education is now free, universal, and compulsory.  Lesotho spends a higher proportion of its GDP (13%) on education than any other country in the world   and an average child in Lesotho can expect to spend 10 years of their life in education.  Education is compulsory only between the ages of 6 and 13.  Secondary school education is non-compulsory, and as of 2005 was attended by 24.0% of 13- to 17-year-olds.  There is a gender disparity present in secondary education, with more females attending than males. This disparity is greatest in wealthier areas, where males are 15.6% less likely than females to attend secondary school.  Free primary education began to be introduced to Lesotho in the year 2000.  Before that, many boys received no primary education at all and spent their time herding animals.  The adult literacy rate is higher for women (95%) than for men (83%).  When free primary education was introduced, the government of Lesotho decided to phase it in gradually, with fee elimination beginning for the youngest children in the year 2000.  In 2010, with primary school enrollment rates standing at 82%, an Education Act was introduced to make primary education not only free, but also compulsory.  Lesotho has two universities.  Its main university is the National University of Lesotho, located in Roma, which has around 2000 registered students.  The capital, Maseru, has been home to a campus of Limkokwing University since 2008.
