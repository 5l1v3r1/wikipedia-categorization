Giuseppe Piccio was a Venetian literary critic and editor of the Italian literary magazine L’Alba.  An instructor at the Marco Foscarini Royal Gymnasium, Piccio also compiled the Dizionario veneziano–italiano, published in 1916, significantly at a time when Venetian had been gradually losing favor to Tuscan even among Venetian literary circles. The Dizionario remains one of the few extant dictionaries of Venetian to this day.
