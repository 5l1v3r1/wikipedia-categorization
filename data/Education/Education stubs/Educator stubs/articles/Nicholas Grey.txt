Nicholas Grey (1590?-1660), was headmaster of Eton College. Grey was born in London about 1590. He was a king's scholar at Westminster School, and proceeded in 1606 to Christ Church, Oxford. He graduated B.A. on 21 June 1610, and M.A. on 10 June 1613. In 1614 he was incorporated M.A. at Cambridge,  and on 3 December of that year became head-master of Charterhouse School. On forfeiting the mastership of the Charterhouse by his marriage, he became rector of Castle Camps, Cambridgeshire. On 29 January 1624-5 he was elected head-master of Merchant Taylors' School, and continued there until midsummer 1632, when he was chosen head-master of Eton College and fellow of Eton. During the civil war he was ejected from his rectory and fellowship, and was reduced to great distress. He obtained eventually the head-mastership of Tonbridge School, Kent, and published for the use of his scholars Parabolæ Evangelicæ Latino redditæ carmine paraphrastico varii generis, 8vo, London, no date.
