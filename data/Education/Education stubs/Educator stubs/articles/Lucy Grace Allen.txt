Lucy Grace Allen (born 1867) was an American cookery teacher and author. She studied and then taught at Mrs Farmer's School of Cookery (founded by Fannie Farmer) in Boston, Massachusetts. In 1915, together with Minnie S. Turner, Allen co-founded the Boston School of Cookery at 48a Gloucester Street,  becoming the new school's director.   In 1926, she was described as having lived her whole life in New England.  An excerpt from her influential Table Service (first edition 1915), once described as "a clear, concise and yet comprehensive exposition of the waitress' duties",  was printed in the anthropological anthology Rules and Meanings (1973).
