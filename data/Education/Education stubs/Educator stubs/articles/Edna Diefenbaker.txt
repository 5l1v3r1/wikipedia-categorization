Edna May Diefenbaker (née Brower; November 30, 1899 – February 7, 1951) was the first wife of the 13th Prime Minister of Canada, John Diefenbaker. She was born in Wawanesa, Manitoba, and worked as a schoolteacher  at Mayfair Elementary School in Saskatoon before marrying John Diefenbaker in 1929.   Outgoing and vivacious, with a genuine concern for others, Edna was thought to be a popular teacher. Her marriage brought an end to her teaching career, and Edna devoted her energies to the advancement of Diefenbaker's political career. She would visit towns before her husband so that he was prepared with information on the inhabitants.   Edna also edited Diefenbaker's speeches, and often acted as chauffeur, driving him to meetings.  Perhaps most importantly, Edna helped John to overcome his shyness and develop into a "man of the people", which would help him in his future political successes. Upon Diefenbaker's election as a Progressive Conservative Member of Parliament Edna worked on his behalf, in an unpaid capacity.  She was a constant presence in the visitor's gallery in the House of Commons of Canada, and played an important role in establishing close relationships between John and reporters in the Ottawa press gallery.  She died of leukemia in 1951, predeceasing her husband's first term as prime minister.  MPs in the House of Commons of Canada gave her "unprecedented eulogies" for a non-MP.   Diefenbaker later married Olive Palmer, his wife during his term as Prime Minister. Edna is interred at Woodlawn Cemetery beside Diefenbaker's mother Mary, his father, brother and an uncle. In 1982, Edna became the focus of Simma Holt's book The Other Mrs. Diefenbaker.  Author Heather Robertson also wrote on her and other spouses of the Prime Ministers of Canada in the book More Than a Rose (1991).
