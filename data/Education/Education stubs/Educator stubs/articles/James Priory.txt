James Edwin Priory (born February 1973 ) is the current Headmaster of Tonbridge School. Prior to his appointment at Tonbridge, he was headmaster of Portsmouth Grammar School. He arrived at the school as Head of English in September 2000, and was subsequently appointed Head of the Sixth Form in 2005. He had previously taught at Bradford Grammar School and, as head of year 7, he helped to introduce the first girls to the school.  During his tenure as headmaster at PGS, Priory has overseen improving public examination results,  the introduction of the International Baccalaureate,  and the construction of a new science building (the Bristow-Clavell Science Centre)  and sixth form centre.  He has also supported efforts to establish an LGBT society for the school community, called PGS Pride, earning official recognition by the gay rights charity, Stonewall.  Priory studied English at Lincoln College, Oxford and has written articles for The Daily Telegraph, arguing in one that schools have become too focused on examination success, rather than delivering an "all-round education."
