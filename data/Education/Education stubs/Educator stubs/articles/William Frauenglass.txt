In my school when the first alertness course was given by the board of education in that field and the principal asked for somebody to volunteer to take part, I volunteered for the very first course, I think, given under the auspices of Mrs. Dubois at Textile High School, and I became in tensely interested in the subject and volunteered and was commended by the chairman of my department for introducing cultural activity into that field   Frauenglass pled the Fifth whenever asked about affiliations with the Communist Party USA.
