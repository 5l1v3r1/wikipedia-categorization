Hanan Al Hroub is a Palestinian teacher who in 2016 was the second winner of the Global Teacher Prize, who specialises in supporting children traumatised by violence.  She grew up in a Palestinian refugee camp, Bethlehem,  where she experienced and saw violent acts, and her own children were traumatized by a shooting incident in which her husband was shot in his car on an Israeli army check point . She was studying English at university and wanted to become a translator.  She teaches Palestinian refugee children, and her slogan is "No to Violence". She uses a specialised approach she developed herself, which uses play that is aimed at resolving violence and tension. The method is detailed in her book, We Play and Learn. She has said that when she started teaching, "the violence that kids were seeing in the streets, they were carrying into the classroom," but that after a few months, their behavior and attitude improved dramatically.  In March 2016, Al Hroub was the second winner of the $1Â million Global Teacher Prize.     The Varkey Foundation's Global Education and Skills Forum presents the annual award,  and Al Hroub's award was commemorated in a video message from Pope Francis.  The winner in 2015 was American teacher Nancie Atwell. She has 5 children.  Her husband, Omar, served 10 years in an Israeli prison after having been convicted as an accomplice in a deadly 1980 bombing attack in Hebron in which six people died while walking home from Friday night Sabbath prayers. This event was reported by The Associated Press. Omar al-Hroub was a chemist who provided chemicals needed for making the bombs.
