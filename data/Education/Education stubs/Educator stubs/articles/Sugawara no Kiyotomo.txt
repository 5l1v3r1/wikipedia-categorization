Sugawara no Kiyotomo (菅原 清公, 770 – November 26, 842), also read as Kiyogimi and Kiyotada, was a Japanese Heian period courtier and bureaucrat. Originally he served the Imperial Prince directly, but was then sent on a mission to China, and was named governor of Owari province (尾張の輔, Owari no suke) upon his return. In this role, he implemented many elements of Chinese modes of governing, and opposed capital punishment. Kiyotomo later became Daigaku no kami (大学の上), a position analogous to Minister of Education. As daigaku no kami, he sought to introduce Chinese forms of administration and education into Japan's earliest universities, and reformed many aspects of the university overall. Kiyotomo also helped compile a poetry anthology called Ryōunshū, along with Ono no Minemori, in 814.
