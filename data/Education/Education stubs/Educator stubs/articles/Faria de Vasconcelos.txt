António de Sena Faria de Vasconcelos Azevedo (1880–1939) was a Portuguese educator and educationalist.  Faria de Vasconcelos studied law in Coimbra before going to study at the New University of Brussels in 1902 . Like many Portuguese teachers in the first half of the twentieth century, he spent some time at the Rousseau Institute in Geneva,  where he was a student of Édouard Claparède.  He was headmaster of an experimental school at Bierges-les-Wavre, though the school did not survive World War I, and a professor at the New University of Brussels.  He subsequently directed a training school for secondary school teachers which had been founded by Georges Rouma in 1909.  From 1918 to 1920 he taught a specialized course  in educational psychology for school doctors at the normal school at Sucre in Bolivia.  He was later a professor at Lisbon, where he founded the Institute of Careers Guidance (Instituto de Orientação Profissional) in 1925.
