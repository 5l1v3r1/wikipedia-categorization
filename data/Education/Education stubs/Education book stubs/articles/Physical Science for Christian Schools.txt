Such texts "invariably contain editorial comment. For instance, [this book] tells its student readers:  The categories [of elements] are a reflection of the kinds of people we find in the world.  On the two extremes are the saved and unsaved people....Unfortunately there is an intermediate group, the metalloid Christian--the worldly or carnal Christian.  This type of person says he is saved but acts like an unsaved person at times. You should not be a metalloid Christian. [p.179]   Creation science
