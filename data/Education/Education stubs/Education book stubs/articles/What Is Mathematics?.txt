What Is Mathematics? is a mathematics book written by Richard Courant and Herbert Robbins, published in England by Oxford University Press.  It is an introduction to mathematics, intended both for the mathematics student and for the general public. First published in 1941, it discusses number theory, geometry, topology and calculus.   A second edition was published in 1996 with an additional chapter on recent progress in mathematics, written by Ian Stewart. The book was based on Courant's course material. Although Robbins assisted in writing a large part of the book,  he had to fight for authorship. Nevertheless, Courant alone held the copyright for the book. This resulted in Robbins receiving a smaller share of the royalties.   Michael Katehakis remembers Robbins' interest in the literature and Tolstoy in particular and he is convinced that the title of the book is most likely   due to Robbins,  who was inspired by the title of the essay What is Art? by Leo Tolstoy.  Robbins did the same in the book   Great ExpectationsÂ : The Theory of Optimal Stopping  he co-authored with Yuan-Shih Chow and David Siegmund,  where one can not miss the connection with the title of the novel Great Expectations by Charles Dickens. According to Constance Reid,  Courant finalized the title after a conversation with Thomas Mann.
