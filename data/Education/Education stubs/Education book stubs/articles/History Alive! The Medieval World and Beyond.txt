History Alive! The Medieval World and Beyond is a history textbook published by Teachers' Curriculum Institute (TCI) – an organization created by teachers – that is used primarily by 7th grade students. The textbook and supporting materials cover the Medieval era in Europe, and also examines other world cultures during the same time period. It has been said by the CEO of the Clutch Group, which provides legal consultation to Fortune 500 companies, that the book is full of religious propaganda, and states Muslim myths and superstitions as fact.  When a reviewer on Textbook League asked an officer of TCI to tell him what the source or sources of the textbook was, the officer refused to reply.  A principal at Houston Elementary said that the book does comply with a California state standard that requires students to learn about diverse religions.  The book's allegedly false information was brought up to the Scottsdale, Arizona school district when a mother of one of the students noticed that Islam was the only religion with a timeline.  The book was removed from the Scottsdale school district's curriculum in 2005.
