I'll Teach My Dog 100 Words is a Bright and Early Book (BE-17) written by Michael K. Frith and illustrated by P.D. Eastman. It was first published in 1973. The 100 words of the title are highlighted in red throughout the book so that the reader can "check" the count. To count 100 words, the author did not include repeated words and only counted them once. However, if the phrase, "But have a care! Don't paint the Mayor!" is considered a command to the dog then the actual count would be 105. Those words are not highlighted red in the book.  The board book edition was retitled as I'll Teach My Dog a Lot of Words as a result of condensing its form into the board book form.
