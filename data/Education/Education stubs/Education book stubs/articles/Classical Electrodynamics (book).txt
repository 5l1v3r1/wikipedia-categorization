Classical Electrodynamics is a textbook about the subject of that name written by John David Jackson. The book originated as lecture notes that Jackson prepared for teaching graduate-level electromagnetism at McGill University.  Intended for graduate students, and often known as Jackson for short,  it has been a standard reference on its subject since its first publication in 1962.  The book has a reputation for the difficulty of the exercises it contains, and for its tendency to treat non-obvious conclusions as self-evident.
