Movements in European History was a school textbook, originally published by Oxford University Press, by the English author D. H. Lawrence. Lawrence was facing destitution at the time and he wrote it as a potboiler. The first edition was published under the pseudonym "Lawrence H. Davison" because his fictional works, such as The Rainbow (1915), had been prosecuted for alleged eroticism.
