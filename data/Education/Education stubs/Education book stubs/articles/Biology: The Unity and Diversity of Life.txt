Biology: The Unity and Diversity of Life is a college-level introductory biology textbook that helps students learn how to apply critical thinking and scientific methods to developing their understanding of basic concepts in molecular biology and biochemistry, genetics, biotechnology, reproduction and embryonic development, anatomy and physiology of plants and animals, evolution, taxonomy, and ecology. The book is designed to create in students a broad foundation of knowledge in biology and is frequently used in AP Biology classes in American high schools. Each book includes an interactive CD-ROM with links to additional instructional material. Like many textbooks new versions are printed every few years and reflect discoveries and paradigm shifts in scientific knowledge. The book is published by Brooks/Cole and is currently in its twelfth edition. It was primarily compiled by Cecie Starr and Ralph Taggart with pictures and illustrations by Lisa Starr. The book was translated into more than a dozen languages, among others into Hebrew, published by the Open University of Israel.
