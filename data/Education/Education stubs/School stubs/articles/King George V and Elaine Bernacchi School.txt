King George V and Elaine Bernacchi School (KGV/EBS) is a government senior high school of Kiribati, located in Bikenibeu, South Tarawa. As of  1993[update] it has almost 600 students. In 1993 it had a competitive admissions process as there was not enough space for every high school student in Kiribati; the remainder had to enroll in Christian high schools.  Since then the Kiribati government had established two additional government high schools.  The school is next to the Ministry of Education head office.  It was formed by the 1965 merger of two schools:  King George V School, a boys' secondary school that was founded in 1922 in Bairiki and later moved to Abemama,  and then Bikenibeu in 1953, and the Elaine Bernachi School, a girls' secondary school founded in 1959 in Bikenibeu.  Previously teachers at KGV/EBS did curriculum development for all government schools in Kiribati, but in 1988 they began asking for compensation for their curriculum development. The Curriculum Development and Resources Centre (CDRC), formed in 1992, eventually assumed responsibility for that task.
