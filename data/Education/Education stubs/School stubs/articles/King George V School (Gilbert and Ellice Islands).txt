King George V School (KGV) was a government high school for boys in the Gilbert Islands (now Kiribati), within the British colony Gilbert and Ellice Islands. Throughout its history it was in multiple locations in South Tarawa and Abemama. It served as a boarding school,  and trained people to be government workers and teachers.  John Garrett, author of Where Nets Were Cast: Christianity in Oceania Since World War II, wrote that many of its alumni "shaped a nucleus which assisted" the independence of what became Kiribati.  It was originally located in Bairiki, South Tarawa, where it opened in 1922.  For much of its history its headmaster was a New Zealander, F. G. L. Holland.  At some point it moved to Abemama.  It moved to Bikenibeu, South Tarawa in 1953. By 1955 students from Motufoua Secondary School in Vaitupu, Ellice Islands (now known as Tuvalu) were boarding at King George V. In 1965 KGV merged with the girls' school Elaine Bernacchi School (EBS) to form the coeducational King George V and Elaine Bernacchi School.  It had 150 students in 1955.
