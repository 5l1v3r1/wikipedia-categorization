The Ukrainian Association of Student Self-government (Ukrainian: Українська асоціація студентського самоврядування, abbreviated УАСС or UASS) is a Ukrainian independent and democratic national students' union. The union was established in 1999. UASS voluntarily brings together students unions, community organizations, student clubs and scientific societies that operate in higher educational institutions in Ukraine, as well as some active students to protect the rights and representation interests of the Ukrainian student community at the national and international levels.
