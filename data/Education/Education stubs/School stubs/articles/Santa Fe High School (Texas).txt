Santa Fe High School is a high school in Santa Fe, Texas in the Houston metropolitan area. It is part of the Santa Fe Independent School District. In addition to Santa Fe, its district serves parts of League City, La Marque, Hitchcock, and Dickinson.  The high school football team's practice of praying during school-sanctioned sporting events was involved in the court case Santa Fe Independent School District v. Doe.  A gunman opened fire on faculty and staff on May 18, 2018, killing eight students and two teachers  and injuring thirteen others.  The alleged gunman was a student at the school. Ten people were fatally shot and thirteen others were wounded. As a result of the mass shooting, the district plans to renovate the northwest area of the campus, including sealing off the art rooms in which the shooting occurred as well as the adjacent hallway. A new hallway and counselor's office will be installed.  The art classrooms and art teacher offices were to be relocated.  In July 2018 the district decided to install a bulletproof security area at the main entrance,  which included adding metal detectors,  as well as adding panic buttons, locks, and alarm systems in classrooms. The district chose not to install a security fence.  As of  2018[update], the school had about 1,500 students, with the majority being Hispanic and non-Hispanic white and with 24% being classified as low income.
