The journal was originally published by the University of Ioannina, but switched to the Royal Society of Chemistry at the end of 2005 when it merged with University Chemistry Education. The society also publishes Education in Chemistry, a news magazine on the same topic. The journal is able to be open-access, yet not have page or process charges levied against authors, due to sponsorship from the Education Division of the RSC. The RSC is a charity, as well as a learned society, and support for an open-access educational journal is seen as furthering its educational mission.
