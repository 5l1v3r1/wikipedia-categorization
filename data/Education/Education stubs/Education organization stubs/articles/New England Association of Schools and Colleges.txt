The New England Association of Schools and Colleges, Inc. (NEASC) is a United States' regional accreditation association providing educational accreditation for all levels of education, from pre-kindergarten to the doctoral level. NEASC is an independent, voluntary, nonprofit membership organization which connects and serves over 2,000 public and independent schools, technical/career institutions, colleges and universities in the six New England states (Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont), plus International Schools in more than 65 nations worldwide. Founded in 1885, NEASC has been working to establish and maintain high standards for all levels of education longer than any other accreditation agency in the United States.  NEASC is headquartered in Burlington, Massachusetts.  NEASC focuses on improving education systems and often times partners with other schools or organizations to do so. This can be seen on their twitter page as they tend to post updates semi-regularly. Often times they apply the most successful teaching and learning methods to ensure that students learn and education gets more advanced as a whole.
