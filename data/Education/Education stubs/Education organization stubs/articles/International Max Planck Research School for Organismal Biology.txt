Its goal is to provide training and education to PhD students from over the world in a work environment. Research focuses on behavioral science, ecology, evolutionary biology, physiology and neurobiology.   The IMPRS for Organismal Biology was founded in 2009. In October 2010, the first 30 doctoral students began their research. The faculty consists of more than 30 leading scientists from the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology and the Department of Biology from the University of Konstanz   .
