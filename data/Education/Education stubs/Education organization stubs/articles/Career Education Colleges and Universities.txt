Career Education Colleges and Universities is a Washington, D.C. based trade organization that represented about 1,500 for-profit colleges as of January 2011.  From 2010  to  July 2016, it was known as the Association of Private Sector Colleges and Universities, also known by the acronym APSCU;  before that, it was called the Career College Association, but changed its name in 2010.  As of July 2015, most large for-profit college chains had left the group in the previous year.  The organization engages in extensive lobbying, and has vocally opposed the Obama administration's attempts to regulate for-profit colleges. Its president, Steve Gunderson, a former Republican congressman, has said that the laws proposed by Obama are "evidence of an ideological declaration of war against the private sectorâ€™s involvement in the delivery of postsecondary education."  In 2012, the Association brought a lawsuit against a United States Department of Education initiative aimed at improving the quality of degrees issued by for-profit colleges, which ended with Judge Rudolph Contreras striking down the regulations, which he called "arbitrary and capricious".  In 2014, the Association brought a second lawsuit challenging similar regulations (79 FR 64890).
