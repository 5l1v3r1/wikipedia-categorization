  The National Association of British Schools in Spain (NABSS, Spanish: Asociación Nacional de Colegios Británicos en España) is an association of British independent schools operating in Spain. NABSS enjoys an affiliation with the British Council in Spain, and many NABSS schools are also members of the Council of British International Schools and the European Council of International Schools. Founded in 1978, NABSS members are British schools that are fully authorised by the Spanish Ministry of Education, and recognised by the British Council and its official inspectorate. The association regularly inspects its members and offers training for Heads and teachers of its schools. There is also an annual NABSS conference. NABSS schools offer a range of British qualifications to students, including GCSEs, AS and A Levels. Most also organise UCAS applications to universities in the UK. The association is organised by an elected committee, made up of head teachers and proprietors of NABSS member schools.
