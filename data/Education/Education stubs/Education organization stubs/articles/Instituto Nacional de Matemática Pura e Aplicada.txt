It is located in the city of Rio de Janeiro, and was formerly known simply as Instituto de Matemática Pura e Aplicada, hence its official abbreviation. As of 2015, IMPA does research in algebra, analysis, differential geometry, partial differential equations, computer graphics, fluid dynamics, holomorphic dynamics, mathematical economics, symplectic geometry, algebraic geometry, optimization, probability theory, dynamical systems, and ergodic theory. It is aiming to expand its lines of research to include topology, number theory, combinatorics, and discrete mathematics in general and its applications.   Artur Avila, a 2014 Fields Medalist, is a researcher at IMPA and received his Ph.D there.  Among its researchers also are Jacob Palis, Elon Lages Lima, Maurício Peixoto, Manfredo do Carmo, Marcelo Viana, Welington de Melo, Enrique Pujals, Harold Rosenberg, Marcos Dajczer, Carlos Gustavo Moreira, Fernando Codá Marques, César Camacho, Arnaldo Garcia, Alfredo Noel Iusem, Karl-Otto Stöhr, Robert Morris, and Carolina Araujo.
