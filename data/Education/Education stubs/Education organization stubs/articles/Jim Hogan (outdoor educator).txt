James Martin Hogan is primarily known as co-founder of the worldwide Outward Bound movement of outdoor adventure education schools, along with Kurt Hahn and Lawrence Durning Holt, having been the first warden of the sea school - the first Outward Bound school - established in Aberdovey, Wales by Holt to train crews of his Blue Funnel Line.   Hogan has been credited with choosing the now-famous Outward Bound motto: "To serve, to strive, and not to yield."  Hogan was a Boy Scout leader and Wood Badge holder.
