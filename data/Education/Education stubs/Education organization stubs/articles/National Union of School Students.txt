The National Union of School Students was a short lived English organisation founded in 1972.  It campaigned primarily against compulsory school uniform and the use of corporal punishment in schools.   With a grant from the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, the union published the magazine Blot which featured the early work of the cartoonist Steve Bell.
