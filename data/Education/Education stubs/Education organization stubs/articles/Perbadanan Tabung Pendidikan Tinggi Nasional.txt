  National Higher Education Fund Corporation (Malay: Perbadanan Tabung Pendidikan Tinggi Nasional), abbreviated PTPTN is an authority responsible for giving study loans to students pursuing tertiary education in Malaysia. This agency is under Ministry of Education. The PTPTN's Chairman is Wan Saiful Wan Jan, former chief executive of the Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs, ex-Pakatan Harapan candidate for Pendang, and leader of the youth wing of the Malaysian United Indigenous Party, Pemuda PPBM. Some parties, particularly the opposition parties and student organizations want higher education for free and abolish PTPTN agency. Several demonstrations have been made including a meeting with the government. The government will not make education free for some reason     Beginning 2015, hardcore PTPTN loan defaulters have been listed inside Central Credit Reference Information System (CCRIS), which is a Bank Negara Malaysia database system that stores financial records of Malaysian borrowers.   Defaulters also run the risk of being barred from leaving the country altogether.
