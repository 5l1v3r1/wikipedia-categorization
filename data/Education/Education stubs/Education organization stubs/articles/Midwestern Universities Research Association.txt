The Midwestern Universities Research Association (MURA) was a collaboration between 15 universities with the goal of designing and building a particle accelerator for the Midwestern United States. It existed between 1953â€“1967, but could not achieve its goal in this time and lost funding. It was thought that President John F. Kennedy would have supported the MURA machine, while one of President Lyndon B. Johnson's first actions was the shutdown of the MURA machine and laboratory.   In its formative years, Donald Kerst was the director of MURA.  At this institution, Keith Symon invented the FFAG accelerator, independently to Tihiro Ohkawa, which combines several concepts of cyclotrons and synchrotrons. FFAG concepts were extensively developed in MURA. The proposed MURA accelerators were scaling FFAG synchrotrons, meaning that orbits of any momentum are photographic enlargements of those of any other momentum. The concept of FFAG acceleration was revived in the early 1980s,  and gained interest up to the present day, see e.g. EMMA (accelerator).
