Technopolis is a Flemish technology education centre located near Mechelen. Technopolis is an initiative which grew out of the Flanders Technology International (FTI) Foundation, which was an initiative of the Flemish government. Since 7 October 1999, the FTI offices are located within the premises of the Technopolis centre and the name of the organization was changed to Technopolis.
