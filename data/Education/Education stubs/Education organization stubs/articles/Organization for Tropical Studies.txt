The Organization for Tropical Studies is a network of ecological research stations in Costa Rica and South Africa in 1963.  OTS is run by a non-profit consortium of 63 universities, based in the United States, Australia, South Africa and Latin America .  The North American Office is located at Duke University, in Durham, North Carolina.  OTS offers a variety of courses in Spanish and English for high school, university, and graduate students.  Most of the coursework and research conducted at OTS stations focuses on tropical ecology, and the three research stations are located in distinct ecozones. Along with Cocha Cashu Biological Station and the Manu Learning Centre in Peru, and the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute on Barro Colorado Island in Panama, the OTS research stations in general (and La Selva in particular) provide some of the most important and productive sites of original research on neotropical ecology.
