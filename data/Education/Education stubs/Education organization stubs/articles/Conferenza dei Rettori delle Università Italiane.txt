The Conferenza dei Rettori delle Universit√† Italiane (CRUI; English: Conference of Italian University Rectors) is an association of public and private universities in Italy.  It began in 1963 as a private organization, later becoming an official advisor to the government.  The supporting Fondazione CRUI (foundation) formed in 2001.  CRUI operates from headquarters at the Piazza Rondanini in the Sant'Eustachio rione of Rome. CRUI has developed several guidelines for policy and implementation of scholarly open access publishing.  Since 2009 it has been the subject of numerous controversies due to a supposed political role and in support of the interests of the category of the rectors that compose it, despite the nature of university association. In particular, it was criticized for its support for the draft of the 1905 Law by Minister Gelmini. The criticisms have sometimes come from some of the rectors themselves.   The following men have served as presidents of the group.
