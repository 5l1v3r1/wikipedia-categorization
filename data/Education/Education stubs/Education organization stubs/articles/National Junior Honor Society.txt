The National Junior Honor Society (NJHS) is an international student organization that consists of chapters in middle schools (grades 6-9).  The NJHS was founded by the National Association of Secondary School Principals, and today has chapters in the United States, Puerto Rico, other U.S. Territories, and Canada.  To be considered for the honor of membership applicants must reach the five standards which include leadership, citizenship, character, service, and scholarship. Applicants must have at least 5 or more hours of community service to get in. However, this is not always the case. Each chapter sets its own membership selection criteria.  Generally, the selection is based on six criterion: citizenship, service, leadership, scholarship, behavior, and character. The selection will be judged by the teacher which review and confirm the applicant is exceptional levels. Common requirements include maintaining a high-grade point average (the national minimum is a 3.5 or all A's and one B) and becoming good citizens (by participating in service projects). The NJHS requires some sort of school service to the community, school, or other organization. The projects help students to meet the required monthly service hours of 1.5 hours. Some Chapters have officers, which lead the chapter as a whole, and are selected by their peers.
