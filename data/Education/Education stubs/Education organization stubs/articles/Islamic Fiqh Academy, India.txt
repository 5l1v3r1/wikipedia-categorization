Islamic Fiqh Academy, India (IFA) was established in 1988 at New Delhi under the guidance and supervision of the great known Islamic Scholars. It was registered as a charitable trust in the year 1990. Hazrat Maulana Qazi Mujahidul Islam Qasmi was its founder Secretary General. He guided the Academy until his death. Academy is a registered NGO working as a research oriented organization since then. The IFA through its diversified and remarkable work has created a distinguished and respectable place for itself, not only in India but also abroad. It has made distinct and indelible impressions upon the Muslim society and its voice commands respectability in the Ummah. The Academy maintains strong relations with various national and international academic circles. The Academy has thankfully received precious contribution and cooperation from both religious and contemporary scholars. Hundreds of smaller and larger Madrasas (Islamic Learning Centers) and their teachers are in constant touch with the Academy. A large number of young graduates (Fazils) from Madrasas are being benefited greatly by various programmes conducted by the Academy. They are being trained for facing and combating the challenges of the future. Brilliant and outstanding students of a large number of Madrasas have found the training camps of the Academy, a rare occasion to have an exposure to the contemporary issues facing the Ummah. Other programmes of the Academy have been received by the academic circles as valuable and precious contributions towards learning and scholarship. The Academy has been coordinating and working with other academic and Fiqh institutions worldwide also. It has been putting special emphasis on coordinating with such institutions which are active in countries and areas with a significant Muslim minority population, like USA and Europe, on issues of Fiqh and Minorities.
