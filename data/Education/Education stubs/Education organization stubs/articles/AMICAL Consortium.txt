The American International Consortium of Academic Libraries (AMICAL) is an association of 26 American-style universities located in 21 countries. It was founded in 2004 by the American University of Paris, with support from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.  "AMICAL is an international consortium of American-model, liberal arts institutions of higher learning located outside the United States. Our mission is to advance learning, teaching and research through the collaborative development of library and information services and curricular resources at member institutions. AMICAL is committed to sharing information and technologies across national and linguistic borders, using English as the primary language for consortial work."
