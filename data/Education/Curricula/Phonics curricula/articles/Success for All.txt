Success for All (SFA) refers to standards-based Comprehensive School Reform curricula for early childhood through middle school, produced by the nonprofit organization Success for All Foundation (SFAF). Psychologist Robert Slavin of Johns Hopkins University founded SFAF along with his wife, Nancy Madden. In 2010, Success for All received a nearly $50 million grant from the U.S. Department of Education.   The Success for All program was critiqued in Jonathan Kozol's book, The Shame of the Nation, as excessively dogmatic, utilitarian, and authoritarian.
