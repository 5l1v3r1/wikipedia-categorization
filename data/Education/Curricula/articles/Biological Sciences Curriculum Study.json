Arnold Grobman, a herpetologist, served as the first director of BSCS, from 1958 until 1965.  <a href=\"/wiki/Hiram_Bentley_Glass\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hiram Bentley Glass\">Hiram Bentley Glass</a>, a geneticist, chaired the first Steering Committee (later the Board) from 1959 until 1965.  The BSCS leadership during its first decade of operation was mainly made up of professional biologists.  These professional biologists worked with high school educators and administrators to develop and implement new curriculum materials.\n</p><p>During the first Steering Committee meetings in 1959, the BSCS decided to target high school biology, mainly at the tenth-grade level, for improvement.  In the summer of 1960, the BSCS convened an intensive summer writing conference in Boulder, at which three new high school biology textbooks were developed.  The three versions were: Blue, a <a href=\"/wiki/Molecular_biology\" title=\"Molecular biology\">molecular biology</a> approach; Green, an <a href=\"/wiki/Ecology\" title=\"Ecology\">ecology</a> approach; and Yellow, a <a href=\"/wiki/Cellular_biology\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cellular biology\">cellular biology</a> approach.  These three versions, and their corresponding newly developed laboratory exercises, were piloted at high schools around the United States during the 1960-61 school year.  The curriculum materials were then revised during the summer of 1961 based on feedback from teachers, students and professional biologists, and tested again during 1961-62.  In 1963, the three textbook versions were published commercially.\n</p><p>All three BSCS curriculum versions stressed key biological themes, such as science as inquiry, the complementarity of structure and function, genetic continuity and <a href=\"/wiki/Evolution\" title=\"Evolution\">evolution</a>.  The BSCS textbooks emphasized evolution as a major scientific theory at a time when it was largely omitted from existing high school curricula, and the BSCS organization has remained committed to the teaching of evolution since its inception.\n</p><p>The BSCS also expanded its work beyond standard tenth-grade biology curriculum to produce educational materials for exceptional students, for teachers, and for all educational levels, from kindergarten to adult.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Products\">Products</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Biological_Sciences_Curriculum_Study&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Products\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>To advance the teaching of science, BSCS developed a lesson structure they call the \"BSCS 5E Instructional Model\", standing for the different sections of a lesson.  It is important to note that it is NOT considered that these 5 sections\u2014that this lesson\u2014would be done in a single 50-60 minute class period.  These 5 E's include: Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate, Evaluate.\n</p>\n<ul><li>The five phases of the BSCS 5E Instructional Model are designed to facilitate the process of conceptual change.</li></ul>\n<p>The use of this model brings coherence to different teaching strategies, provides connections among educational activities, and helps science teachers make decisions about interactions with students.\nEach phase of the model and a short phrase to indicate its purpose from a student perspective are:\n</p>\n<pre>   Engagement - students\u2019 prior knowledge accessed and interest engaged in the phenomenon\n   Exploration - students participate in an activity that facilitates conceptual change\n   Explanation - students generate an explanation of the phenomenon\n   Elaboration - students' understanding of the phenomenon challenged and deepened through new experiences\n   Evaluation - students assess their understanding of the phenomenon\n</pre>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Evolution_controversy\">Evolution controversy</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Biological_Sciences_Curriculum_Study&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Evolution controversy\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>During the <a href=\"/wiki/Cold_War\" title=\"Cold War\">Cold War</a>, in 1957, the <a href=\"/wiki/Union_of_Soviet_Socialist_Republics\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Union of Soviet Socialist Republics\">Soviet Union</a> successfully launched the first Earth orbiting artificial satellite, <a href=\"/wiki/Sputnik_I\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sputnik I\">Sputnik I</a>.  The event triggered alarm in <a href=\"/wiki/United_States\" title=\"United States\">United States</a> by heightening fears there that the Soviet Union were achieving technological and strategic superiority.  One response to what the Americans termed the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Sputnik_crisis\" title=\"Sputnik crisis\">Sputnik crisis</a></i> was to invest money and expertise towards a re-invigoration of the country's science and technological educational system.  It was during this period that the BSCS was engaged to develop updated high school <a href=\"/wiki/Biology\" title=\"Biology\">biology</a> textbooks.  The biology texts they developed covered <a href=\"/wiki/Evolution\" title=\"Evolution\">evolutionary theory</a>, which was by this time overwhelmingly accepted as biology's central organizing principle.\n</p><p>These books became widely used in the nation's high schools, and as a consequence, the public <a href=\"/wiki/Creation-evolution_controversy\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Creation-evolution controversy\">controversy</a> about the teaching of evolution in public schools re-ignited.  After a <a href=\"/wiki/Epperson_v._Arkansas\" title=\"Epperson v. Arkansas\">1968 Supreme Court decision</a> nullified decades-old laws prohibiting the teaching of evolution in many places of the country, some evolution opponents turned their efforts against the public funding of evolutionary teaching, including publicly funded textbooks.  The BSCS textbooks were featured in the 1973 case <i><a href=\"/wiki/Willoughby_v._Stever\" title=\"Willoughby v. Stever\">Willoughby v. Stever</a></i>, a suit filed by an evangelical opponent of evolution who attempted, and failed, to have the evolution instruction in the textbook legally recognized as an <a href=\"/wiki/Constitutionality\" title=\"Constitutionality\">unconstitutional</a> establishment of religious secularism.  The case was dismissed as meritless, and was cited as legal precedent in other groundbreaking decisions in the American cultural battle over evolution in the schools.<sup id=\"cite_ref-larson_1-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-larson-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Notes\">Notes</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Biological_Sciences_Curriculum_Study&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Notes\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-larson-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-larson_1-0\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a href=\"#CITEREFLarson2003\">Larson 2003</a></span>\n</li>\n</ol></div></div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Biological_Sciences_Curriculum_Study&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><i>The BSCS Story: A History of the Biological Sciences Curriculum Study</i> edited by Laura Engleman, Colorado Springs: BSCS, 2001.</li>\n<li><cite class=\"citation news\">Eisenkraft, Arthur (2003). \"Expanding the 5E Model\". <i>The Science Teacher</i>.
