It was superseded by the <a href=\"/wiki/Victorian_Essential_Learning_Standards\" title=\"Victorian Essential Learning Standards\">Victorian Essential Learning Standards (VELS)</a> program in 2006.\n</p><p>The CSF described what students in Victorian schools should know and be able to do in eight key areas of learning at regular intervals from the <a href=\"/wiki/Primary_Education\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Primary Education\">primary</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Secondary_Education\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Secondary Education\">secondary</a> levels of education \u2014 specifically, from year Prep ('Preparatory') to Year 10. It provided sufficient detail for schools and the community to be clear about the major elements of the <a href=\"/wiki/Curriculum\" title=\"Curriculum\">curriculum</a> and the standards expected of successful learners.\n</p><p>The eight key learning areas were <a href=\"/wiki/The_Arts\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Arts\">the Arts</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/English_studies\" title=\"English studies\">English</a>, <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Health_and_Physical_Education&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Health and Physical Education (page does not exist)\">Health and Physical Education</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Languages_Other_Than_English\" title=\"Languages Other Than English\">Languages Other Than English</a> (LOTE), <a href=\"/wiki/Mathematics\" title=\"Mathematics\">Mathematics</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Science\" title=\"Science\">Science</a>, <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Studies_of_Society_and_Environment&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Studies of Society and Environment (page does not exist)\">Studies of Society and Environment</a> (SOSE) and <a href=\"/wiki/Technology\" title=\"Technology\">Technology</a>. A document, the ESL Companion to the English CSF was also part of the project - it describes stages of English as a second language development. This latter document was an important part of the csf, acknowledging the teaching and assessment needs of the many students learning English as a second or additional language. \n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"VELS_to_replace_CSF\">VELS to replace CSF</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Curriculum_and_Standards_Framework&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: VELS to replace CSF\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Victorian_Essential_Learning_Standards\" title=\"Victorian Essential Learning Standards\">Victorian Essential Learning Standards (VELS)</a> will progressively replace the Curriculum and Standards Framework as the basis for curriculum and <a href=\"/wiki/Educational_assessment\" title=\"Educational assessment\">assessment</a> in Victorian schools from 2006. \n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Curriculum_and_Standards_Framework&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Education_in_Victoria\" title=\"Education in Victoria\">Education in Victoria</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Victorian_Curriculum_and_Assessment_Authority\" title=\"Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Authority\">Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Authority</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"External_links\">External links</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Curriculum_and_Standards_Framework&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: External links\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20061103235602/http://www.vcaa.vic.edu.au/prep10/csf/index.html\">Curriculum and Standards Framework, VCAA website</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20060821200705/http://vels.vcaa.vic.edu.au/\">Victorian Essential Learning Standards (VELS), VCAA website</a></li></ul>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw1241\nCached time: 20180831073515\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.004 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.011 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 26/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 0/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:7849590-0!canonical and timestamp 20180831073515 and revision id 795648967\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","*":"Curricula"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Education_in_Victoria_(Australia)"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Curriculum"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Education in Victoria"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Educational assessment"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"English studies"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Languages Other Than English"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Mathematics"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Primary Education"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Science"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Secondary Education"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Technology"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"The Arts"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Victoria, Australia"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Authority"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Victorian Essential Learning Standards"},{"ns":0,"*":"Health and Physical Education"},{"ns":0,"*":"Studies of Society and Environment"}],"templates":[],"images":[],"externallinks":["https://web.archive.org/web/20061103235602/http://www.vcaa.vic.edu.au/prep10/csf/index.html","https://web.archive.org/web/20060821200705/http://vels.vcaa.vic.edu.au/"],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"VELS to replace CSF","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Curriculum_and_Standards_Framework","byteoffset":1356,"anchor":"VELS_to_replace_CSF"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"See also","number":"2","index":"2","fromtitle":"Curriculum_and_Standards_Framework","byteoffset":1645,"anchor":"See_also"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"External links","number":"3","index":"3","fromtitle":"Curriculum_and_Standards_Framework","byteoffset":1742,"anchor":"External_links"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Curriculum and Standards Framework","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q17002588"}]}}
