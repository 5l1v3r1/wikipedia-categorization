The Highland School is a democratic school for day and boarding students in Highland, West Virginia. Founded in 1981 by Charlotte and Steve Landvoigt, the Highland School was inspired by the Summerhill School in Suffolk, England. The Highland School is similar to the Sudbury model of democratic schooling. The Highland School's boarding program is a unique feature in the United States, allowing students worldwide to be a part of a democratic learning environment 24 hours a day. Learning occurs through daily social interactions and freely chosen experiences. Children develop personal responsibility through the process of making their own decisions. Students' individual rights are fundamental at The Highland School. These rights are described and protected by their School Constitution.  Highland’s “Bill of Rights” can be found at the conclusion of their Constitution.  Each child no matter how small has the same rights as other children and adults. The Highland School has hosted students from all over the world including Japan, France, Germany, Switzerland and the Philippines. International students interact with day students from central West Virginia and boarding students from other regions of the United States.
