Each department (e.g. Math, Humanities, Science) may also have its own head (or manager or dean) that is responsible for different aspects of the department.  Educators in that department may report to that head who in turn reports to a higher level administration, such as a school or college in a university, or directly to the main administration, such as the principal or head of a school.

A departmental structure may be in place for each field or discipline, but the physical organization of the educational facilities may place different subject-based classrooms or labs in groupings, such as in a defined area, wing, or small learning community.  For example, each grouping may contain co-located classrooms with different instructors focusing on math, English, and Social Sciences near to a <a href=\"/wiki/Science_lab\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Science lab\">Science lab</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Makerspace\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Makerspace\">Makerspace</a>, or <a href=\"/wiki/Vocational_education\" title=\"Vocational education\">Vocational shop</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>  Support spaces for instructors, such as offices or workrooms, and for students, such as seminar rooms and common workspaces, may also be located directly adjacent or nearby.  \n</p>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.designshare.com/images/chap6_designing_new_learning_environments.pdf\">Integrative model diagram, DesignShare P.131</a>.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Project_based_learning_model\">Project based learning model</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=School_organizational_models&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Project based learning model\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Project-based_learning\" title=\"Project-based learning\">Project-based learning</a></div>\n<p>The <b>project-based learning model</b> is a model that supports students \"learning by doing.\"  It may or not be fully interdisciplinary in its organization of subjects. Unlike traditional, teacher-led classroom-based instruction, students often must organize their own work and manage their own time in a project-based class, with an emphasis on student collaboration and hands-on work.  It involves independent research, real-world experiences, opportunities and requirements for students to present and defend their learning, to practice and rehearse. Student projects are at the core of their learning.  This is reflected in the design of educational facilities appearing similar to the integrative model, but with a de-emphasis on traditional instructional spaces such as classrooms and labs, and a greater emphasis on student collaboration spaces and workspaces, such as individual study and group seminar rooms, and workspaces such as Makerspaces and rooms with 2D or <a href=\"/wiki/3D_printing\" title=\"3D printing\">3D printing</a> and production.  The design is student-centered, meaning it is to support the project work, not primarily the convenience of the teachers (e.g. classrooms).  A noted example of this model is <a href=\"/wiki/Gary_and_Jerri-Ann_Jacobs_High_Tech_High_Charter_School\" title=\"Gary and Jerri-Ann Jacobs High Tech High Charter School\">High Tech High</a>.  \n</p>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.designshare.com/images/chap6_designing_new_learning_environments.pdf\">Project-based learning model:  plan diagram, P. 139 and P. 141</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Academy_model\">Academy model</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=School_organizational_models&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Academy model\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The <b>Academy model</b> is an organization that includes specific themes or grades-based organizational groupings within a single institution.  These are sometimes referred to as \"Career Academies\" or \"Career Pathways\". The school may be organized along largely departmental or integrated models, with specially courses geared towards the theme or focus of each academy provided within each academy and the students be enrolled and following their academy's prescribed course of study as they take courses in different departments.  Alternatively, the school may be organized with each academy providing its own core and specialty themed courses.<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>  This can be reflected in the design of educational facilities in several ways: a departmental-type configuration with specialty spaces located in separate areas, or along a single common area with each academy's themed spaces adjacent and observables by students in other academies; or in a similar manner to a SLC or school-within-a-school, with each academy co-located with their specialty space.  For example, a justice-themed academy may have a fully functioning country courtroom off of the commons, such as along the \"Main Street\" in the <a href=\"/wiki/Jack_E._Singley_Academy\" title=\"Jack E. Singley Academy\">Jack E. Singley Academy</a>.  In England, <a href=\"/wiki/Academy_(English_school)\" title=\"Academy (English school)\"><i>Academy</i></a> normally refers to an entire institution offering a distinct program or theme, not a separate division within.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Small_learning_communities_model\">Small learning communities model</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=School_organizational_models&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Small learning communities model\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Small_Learning_Communities\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Small Learning Communities\">Small Learning Communities</a></div>\n<p>The <b>Small Learning Community (SLC) model</b> is an organization geared towards providing a more <a href=\"/wiki/Personalized_learning\" title=\"Personalized learning\">personalized learning</a> environment. A cohort of students and instructors may stay within a given SLC from grade to grade. Teachers in the SLC usually have common planning time to foster collaboration, development of interdisciplinary projects, and to track progress of individual students across subjects.  These include several types, including:  Theme-Based SLCs or Focus Schools, usually formed around a specific curricular theme, such as \"Success Academy\" or \"Humanities\"; grade-based SLCs or Houses, such as Freshman Academies which are structured to support students transitioning into higher-level schools; Career Academies, developed around a career theme or <a href=\"/wiki/Career_Clusters\" title=\"Career Clusters\">Career Clusters</a>; Magnet Schools, career-themed SLCs that include accelerated course-work for Gifted &amp; Talented students.  This is reflected in the design of educational facilities with SLCs designed into separate clusters or groupings, often with a central common or flexible learning area at its heart of the cluster, with a variety of learning and group meeting rooms opening onto it, including several classrooms or learning studios, a science lab, and potentially a makerspace or vocational shop.  A school would have multiple SLCs, often with between 100 and 200 students.<sup id=\"cite_ref-AFA_8-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-AFA-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.designshare.com/index.php/design-patterns/small-learning-community\">Small Learning Communities plan diagram</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.laschools.org/fs-general/download/LAUSD_SLC_final_072805.pdf\">LAUSC Small Learning Communities plan diagram, page 24</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"School-within-a-school_model\">School-within-a-school model</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=School_organizational_models&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: School-within-a-school model\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The <b>school-within-a-school model</b> is similar to the Small Learning Communities model of personalization for both students and schools, but with additional administrative and support functions located within each school or \"community\".
