The National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE) was founded in 1954 to accredit teacher certification programs at colleges and universities in the United States. NCATE was a council of educators created to ensure and raise the quality of preparation for their profession. The U.S. Department of Education recognized NCATE as an accrediting organization. NCATE accreditation is specific to teacher education and is different from regional accreditation. On July 1, 2013, NCATE merged with the Teacher Education Accreditation Council (TEAC), which was also a recognized accreditor of teacher-preparation programs, to form the Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation (CAEP).  Five national education groups were instrumental in the creation of NCATE:  Today NCATE is a coalition of 33 member organizations of teachers, teacher educators, content specialists, and local and state policy makers. All are committed to quality teaching, and together, the coalition represents over 3 million individuals. The professional associations that comprise NCATE also provide financial support and participate in the development of NCATE standards, policies, and procedures.
