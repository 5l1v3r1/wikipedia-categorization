One focuses on the high-stakes standardized tests while the other focuses on taking what the student is learning and applying it to themselves and the society they live in.\n</p><p>Henderson and Kessen\u2019s Curriculum Wisdom book is about one of the three educational paradigms that Henderson says are inherent in one another; they are the standardized management paradigm, the constructivist best practice paradigm, and the curriculum wisdom paradigm. Curriculum wisdom has to do with expanding upon the subject matter the student is learning. The curriculum wisdom paradigm is a \u201cconcise way to convey the subtle and complex challenges of approaching curriculum work as envisioning and enacting a good educational journey\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-kesson_5-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-kesson-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> It is putting the subject matter in context with how it is meaningful to their lives.

Standards are an important topic in education and seeing the Transformative Standards he puts forth shows them in a new light. Received standards stress the importance of \u201cstandardized factual knowledge and skills, knowledge and skills that are testable with a large population, and criteria based on a predetermined metric based on <a href=\"/wiki/Counting\" title=\"Counting\">counting</a>\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-gornik_4-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-gornik-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> These standards are not based on the students or what they have learned.

Wisdom is having knowledge and knowing how to apply it. Henderson gives ways to assess if a student understands and shows wisdom on a topic. He says a student who really understands, \u201ccan explain, can interpret, can apply, sees in perspective, demonstrates <a href=\"/wiki/Empathy\" title=\"Empathy\">empathy</a>, and reveals <a href=\"/wiki/Self-knowledge_(psychology)\" title=\"Self-knowledge (psychology)\">self-knowledge</a>\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-gornik_4-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-gornik-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> Many of these ways to see if a student understands are not normally used in the classroom. The reason is because 3S understanding requires more of the student while at the same time gives them more. It may seem like more work for the student but actually the student is connecting the work to themselves and their surroundings. It will stimulate students more and seeing themselves as lifelong learners will motivate them to acquire knowledge and wisdom.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Example:_Integrated_Curriculum\">Example: Integrated Curriculum</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=3S_Understanding&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: Example: Integrated Curriculum\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/Integrative_learning\" title=\"Integrative learning\">Integrated curricula</a> like teaching for 3S understanding are becoming more popular all around the world.

This article provided excellent insight into why the basic standards are not enough anymore. Arani says:\nOn this basis, the optional courses increase; the teacher\u2019s role changes; and the school should teach the students how to think, decide, and organize their thoughts, as well as how to gain the skills for learning, research, and collection and analysis of data.

The world is a changing place and teachers need to integrate the world into their students\u2019 educations.

The article also discusses a study done at a high school where everyone was from a different place. The high school recruited students from everywhere.  It was the perfect place to have a study on school and its effect on a student\u2019s culture. The study found that students created a culture and working community of their own.
