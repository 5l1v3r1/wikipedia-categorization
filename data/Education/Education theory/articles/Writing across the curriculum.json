Two changes happened to motivate the need for college writing instruction. Firstly, as disciplines (as divisions within academic studies) and contemporary professions specialized, they developed their own specialized discourses. Because these discourses were not merely the same as the everyday discourse of the upper classes, they had to be taught. Secondly, as college students became more diverse \u2013 first in terms of social background and, later, in terms of gender, race, and age \u2013 not all college students grew up speaking the accepted language of the academy.\n</p><p>Clearly, composition courses couldn't be about the content of the writing, because content was what the other disciplines taught. Composition, therefore, had to be about the form the writing took and so \"writing\" was reduced to mechanics and style. Because of this reduced focus and because writing was addressed by composition, other disciplines assumed no responsibility for writing instruction; most students, then, were not taught to write in the context of their specialties. As American education became increasingly skills-oriented following World War II \u2013 in part a reaction to the suffusion of universities with war veterans in need of job training, in part a result of modeling education after the efficiency of Fordian factory production \u2013 writing instruction was further reduced to a set of skills to be mastered. Once correct (that is, standard academic) grammar, punctuation, spelling, and style were mastered \u2013 preferably before reaching the post-secondary level \u2013 there was no need for additional writing instruction save as <a href=\"/wiki/Remedial_education\" title=\"Remedial education\">remedial education</a>.\n</p><p>This product-oriented, skills-focused paradigm of writing pedagogy began to change in the 1970s with the popularization of <a href=\"/wiki/James_N._Britton\" title=\"James N. Britton\">James Britton</a> and colleagues' expressivist school of composition, which said that students benefited from writing as a tool for self-expression and that focusing on technical correctness was damaging. Janet Emig's 1977 article \"Writing as a Mode of Learning,\" grounded in <a href=\"/wiki/Constructivism_(philosophy_of_education)\" title=\"Constructivism (philosophy of education)\">constructivist theories of education</a>, suggested that writing functioned as a unique and invaluable way for students to understand and integrate information. Simultaneously, widespread media attention around college students' apparently decreasing writing proficiency (more a product of the changing demographics of college students than an overt shift in teaching) provoked institutions of higher learning to reevaluate and increase the amount of writing required of students. <a href=\"/wiki/Carleton_College\" title=\"Carleton College\">Carleton College</a> and Beaver College began what were probably the first contemporary WAC programs in 1974 and 1975, respectively, with faculty workshops and writing requirements shared across disciplines.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Russell_2-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Russell-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In 2010, Thaiss and Porter defined WAC as \"a program or initiative used to 'assist teachers across disciplines in using student writing as an instructional tool in their teaching'\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> WAC, then, emerged as and remains a way to bring writing back to disciplines which had become accustomed to assigning relatively little of it. WAC has also been part of the student-centered pedagogies movement (<a href=\"/wiki/Student-centred_learning\" title=\"Student-centred learning\">student-centred learning</a>) seeking to replace teaching via one-way transmission of knowledge from teacher to student with more interactive strategies that enable students to interact with and participate in creating knowledge in the classroom.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Major_theories\">Major theories</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Writing_across_the_curriculum&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Major theories\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>WAC efforts are usually driven principally by one of two theories: writing to learn or on learning to write in disciplinary discourses, sometimes also called writing in the disciplines.

Writing to learn assumes that being able to explain or express concepts in one's own words both builds and reflects understanding. Because the goal of writing to learn exercises is learning rather than a finished writing product, instructors are discouraged from paying attention to grammar and surface mechanics. The student himself or herself, not the teacher, is the audience. Common writing to learn exercises include reading responses, journals, <a href=\"/wiki/Free_writing\" title=\"Free writing\">free writing</a>, and multiple forms of collaborative writing.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Writing_in_the_disciplines\">Writing in the disciplines</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Writing_across_the_curriculum&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Writing in the disciplines\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Writing in the disciplines is also occasionally referred to as the transactional or rhetorical mode of WAC.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> Writing in the Disciplines (WID) teaches students how to write acceptably in their respective disciplines.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> Writing in the Disciplines classes teach students to learn to write texts that they will apply in their scholarly and professional lives.<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> Although WID and WAC are correlated, WID emphasizes disciplinary orientation.

These consultations began with a focus on the qualities and characteristics faculty felt that student majors would exhibit if they were strong communicators. Those discussions led to the articulation of learning outcomes for both writing and oral communication. The departments then developed implementation plans that could help them reach the outcomes, followed or preceded by plans for assessing student abilities in order to further refine or project plans for implementation. <sup id=\"cite_ref-21\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-21\">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup>  <sup id=\"cite_ref-22\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-22\">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup> The Campus Writing and Speaking Program, directed since 1999 by Distinguished Professor Chris Anson (www.ansonica.net), provided much of the support for this campus-wide approach. A few years into the program's existence, Anson and colleague Michael Carter (who is often credited with originating the departmentally-focused approach on which WEC is founded) consulted with Pamela Flash at the University of Minnesota (where Anson had been a professor for 15 years) to help them spearhead a similar effort.

The WEC model created and implemented by the University of Minnesota involves a three-step plan to maximize the rate and accuracy of writing across the curriculum. The first is forming an effective plan. The outlining of plans is attempted through collaborative discussions between numerous departmental faculty and specialists in both writing and assessment and the consideration of previous attempts at effective writing instruction. Some of the content under consideration include writing assessments, locally collected data, stakeholder surveys and writing expectations from instructors. The outcome of this meetings is pronounced expectations and plans for relevant instructions to be implemented in the curricula. The next step is the application of the plan into the undergraduate curriculum and assessing Undergraduate Writing Plans (Molly B). Integrating the WEC model is anticipated to show improvements in writing instruction at a rate that would meet faculty expectations. The permitted writing plans are tested for 1-3 academic years through multiple outlets; writing workshops, seminars, additional research. The effectiveness of the writing plans on student writing is then finally assessed by a subcommittee of the Faculty Senate; the Campus Writing Board. The writing plan assessment is done through results from student writing assessments, panel ratings of students writing against faculty expectations and criteria, the results are then used to guide future writing plans. <sup id=\"cite_ref-26\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-26\">&#91;26&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_principles_of_WAC_and_the_WEC_model\">The principles of WAC and the WEC model</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Writing_across_the_curriculum&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12\" title=\"Edit section: The principles of WAC and the WEC model\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Because WEC closely reflects WAC, the principles that Barbara Walvoord<sup id=\"cite_ref-27\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-27\">&#91;27&#93;</a></sup> gives to devise a WAC program are similar to Anson's Campus Writing and Speaking Program at NC State and Pamela Flash's WEC model<sup id=\"cite_ref-28\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-28\">&#91;28&#93;</a></sup> at the University of Minnesota.
