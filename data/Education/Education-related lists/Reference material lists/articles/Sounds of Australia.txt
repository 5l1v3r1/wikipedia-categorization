The Sounds of Australia (formerly known as the National Registry of Recorded Sound), founded in 2007 is the National Film and Sound Archive's selection of sound recordings with cultural, historical and aesthetic significance and relevance, which inform or reflect life in Australia. Each year, the Australian public nominates new sounds to be added with final selections determined by a panel of industry experts. In this table, '2007a' refers to the 2007 Foundation List (entries chosen before official voting began), while '2007b' refers to the first of the annual registry additions, also in 2007.
