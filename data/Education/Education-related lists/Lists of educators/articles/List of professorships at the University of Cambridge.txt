This is a list of professorships at the University of Cambridge.  During the early history of the University of Cambridge, the title professor simply denoted a doctor who taught in the university, a usage that continues to be found in, for example, US universities. However, from the 16th century onwards in Cambridge it was used to denote those holding "chairs" that had been founded by the university in a particular subject or endowed by a benefaction. On occasion the University of Cambridge creates professorships for the benefit of a single individual, the chair ceasing to exist when that individual resigns, dies, or retires. These "personal" professorships limited to one tenure are not listed here. The Regius Professorships are "royal" professorships, being created by the reigning monarch. The first five Regius Professorships, sometimes referred to as the Henrician Regius Professors, were granted arms and crests in 1590. The title of the professorship is followed by the date of founding. "Experimental Cambridge alumni database: Professors". A Cambridge Alumni Database. University of Cambridge.
