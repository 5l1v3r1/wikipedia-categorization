{"parse":{"title":"List of school-related attacks","pageid":10063044,"revid":859745579,"text":{"*":"<div class=\"mw-parser-output\"><p>This is a list of attacks that have occurred on school property or related primarily to school issues or events. A narrow definition of the word <i>attacks</i> is used for this list so as to exclude warfare, public attacks (as in political protests), accidental shootings, and <a href=\"/wiki/Suicide\" title=\"Suicide\">suicides</a> and murder-suicides by rejected spouses or suitors. Incidents that involved only staff who work at the school have been classified as belonging at <a href=\"/wiki/List_of_rampage_killers\" title=\"List of rampage killers\">List of workplace killings</a>. It also excludes events where no injuries take place, if an attack is foiled. Accounts without reliable sources will be deleted.\n</p><p>The list is divided into three main chronological sections according to school classification: <a href=\"/wiki/Primary_education\" title=\"Primary education\">primary</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Secondary_education\" title=\"Secondary education\">secondary</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Higher_education\" title=\"Higher education\">post-secondary</a>. Additionally, a list is provided for foiled school-related attack plots that resulted in a conviction of perpetrator(s).\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\"
