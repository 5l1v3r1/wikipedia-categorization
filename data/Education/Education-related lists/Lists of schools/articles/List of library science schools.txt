Library science (often termed library studies or library and information science) is an interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary field that applies the practices, perspectives, and tools of management, information technology, education, and other areas to libraries; the collection, organization, preservation, and dissemination of information resources; and the political economy of information. Most professional library jobs require a professional post-baccalaureate degree in library science as a basic credential but this varies widely in different countries. There are also bachelor's, associate, and certificate programs in library science, which provide formal training of paraprofessional library workers, library technicians, and clerksâ€”as well as preparation for graduate study in library science. A library school is an institution of higher learning specializing in the professional training of librarians. As of April 2012 there are 63 American Library Association-accredited Library science programs in Canada and the United States  and as of July 2014, 16 UK institutions offering CILIP-accredited programmes.  http://ss.kln.ac.lk/depts/libinfoscience/ NB In the UK CILIP (the Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals) accredits university courses for professional acceptance - this list reflects all accredited courses as at 4/7/14.
