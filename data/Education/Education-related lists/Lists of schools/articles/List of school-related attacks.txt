This is a list of attacks that have occurred on school property or related primarily to school issues or events. A narrow definition of the word attacks is used for this list so as to exclude warfare, public attacks (as in political protests), accidental shootings, and suicides and murder-suicides by rejected spouses or suitors. Incidents that involved only staff who work at the school have been classified as belonging at List of workplace killings. It also excludes events where no injuries take place, if an attack is foiled. Accounts without reliable sources will be deleted. The list is divided into three main chronological sections according to school classification: primary, secondary, and post-secondary. Additionally, a list is provided for foiled school-related attack plots that resulted in a conviction of perpetrator(s).
