A .22 rifle and a .22 pistol, which were lent to another acquaintance for safe-keeping, were also recovered by authorities. However, no ammunition turned up in the search, so investigators have concluded that the threat of an attack was not imminent.

In his trial, Cossey confessed that he was going to carry out his shooting to kill the people who had relentlessly bullied him in elementary and middle school. Bullying led his parents to pull him out of public school at the end of his 7th grade year and home-school him. It was later found that he also had contact with Pekka-Eric Auvinen, the perpetrator of the <a href=\"/wiki/Jokela_school_shooting\" title=\"Jokela school shooting\">Jokela school shooting</a>, though Cossey apparently had no knowledge of Auvinen's plans.

After checking the bag Yanis' friend told his mother of the weapons, who then forced him to get rid of them by throwing them into a river.
