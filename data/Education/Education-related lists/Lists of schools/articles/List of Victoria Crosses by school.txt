The Victoria Cross has been awarded 1,358 times to persons of any rank in any service and to civilians under military command.  This list only shows a minor proportion. More than 900 VC winners have no school recorded, and some never attended school (primary school was not compulsory in the UK in the 1870s and secondary education only sometime later), so many private soldiers who were awarded the Victoria Cross in the past may never have gone to school or never gone to secondary school. (see British Army during the Victorian Era). "Although the terms of the creation of the VC emphasised that it was open to both services and to all ranks, it is clear that there is a numerical bias towards officers and NCOs".  Clause 13 of the warrant explains that in the "event of a gallant and daring act having been performed" ... "one officer shall be selected by the officers engaged for the Decoration, and in like manner one petty officer or non-commissioned officer".  Three people have been awarded the Victoria Cross and Bar, Christ's College, Christchurch, New Zealand (Charles Upham), Magdalen College School/Liverpool College (Noel Godfrey Chavasse) and Westminster School (Arthur Martin-Leake). The bars are included as separate awards in the columns of the table. The statistics have accuracy issues because The order of the schools is based on the school name due to the missing VCs.
