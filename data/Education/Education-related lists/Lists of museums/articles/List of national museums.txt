A national museum is a museum maintained by a state. In many countries it denotes a museum run by the central government, and often is restricted to a few museums, mostly in the capital, while other museums are run by regional or local government, or foundations.  In other countries a much larger number of museums are run by the central government, some quite small. Some national museums use the term in their name, but others do not; some museums just adopt the term as a matter of branding.     The following is an incomplete and not very reliable list of national museums: National-level museums in India come directly under the administrative control of Ministry of Culture, Government of India.
