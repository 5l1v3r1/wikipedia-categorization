Many American colleges offer programs of study which tag basic bachelor, master, and doctoral degrees with a particular speciality, as is common in the United Kingdom and elsewhere in the world.  A tagged degree incorporates the name of the major into the degree title and generally requires more specialized course work than a degree with an untagged major. Tagged degrees come in two varieties: the first form is a more general bachelors or master's degree with a specialty tag appended to the title (e.g., Bachelor of Science in Nursing); the second form is even more specialized (e.g., Master of Business Administration, Doctor of Medicine, etc.) and is generally associated with a professional education curriculum.
