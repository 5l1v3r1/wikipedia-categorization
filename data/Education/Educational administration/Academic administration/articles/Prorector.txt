In many countries in Europe (e.g. in the USSR and in the independent countries of the former Soviet Union), a prorector is deputy to rector and a member of the management body of a university. In cases with more than one prorector each prorector manages a particular area of university life. Examples include prorector of education and prorector of science. The same applies for Brazil. For example, "Graduation Prorector" means the member of the management body in charge of graduation courses, and so on.
