The principal is the chief executive and the chief academic officer of a university or college in certain parts of the Commonwealth. Queen's University  and McGill University  in Canada have principals instead of presidents or rectors, as a result of their Scottish origins. In addition Bishop's University,  and the Royal Military College of Canada also have principals. Many colleges of further education in England have a principal in charge (e.g., Cirencester College  and West Nottinghamshire College ). At Oxford University, many of the heads of colleges  are known as the principal, including Brasenose, Green Templeton, Harris Manchester, Hertford, Jesus, Lady Margaret Hall, Linacre, Mansfield, St Anne's, St Edmund Hall, St Hilda's, St Hugh's, and Somerville. At Cambridge University, heads of Homerton College and Newnham College are known as the principal.  At Durham University, the heads of most of the colleges are known as the principal. Several of the colleges of the University of London are led by a principal: King's, St George's, Royal Holloway, Queen Mary, the Royal Veterinary College, SOAS, Heythrop, the Royal Academy of Music and the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama. In Scotland the principal is appointed by the University Court or governing body of the University and will be chairman or president of the body of academics.  In the case of the ancient universities of Scotland the principal is president of the Academic Senate.  The principal also holds the title of vice-chancellor, but their powers with regard to this position extend only to the awarding of degrees, as both the vice-chancellor and chancellor are titular posts.
