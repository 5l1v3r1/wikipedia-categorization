By the number of its members it is the most important association of these professionals in <a href=\"/wiki/Spain\" title=\"Spain\">Spain</a>: nowadays, 950 out of 1600 Spanish Inspectors of Education are members of ADIDE, while the rest of them are either unassociated or splitting their membership into several different <a href=\"/wiki/Professional_association\" title=\"Professional association\">associations</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Trade_union\" title=\"Trade union\">unions</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Background\">Background</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Asociaci%C3%B3n_de_Inspectores_de_Educaci%C3%B3n&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Background\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Educational professionals usually group themselves either in unions, professional associations or professional organizations. Unions have as their main aim the defence of the <a href=\"/wiki/Employment\" title=\"Employment\">labour</a> conditions of their members. Professional associations deal with the performance of the Code of Professional <a href=\"/wiki/Ethics\" title=\"Ethics\">Ethics</a> established by the association. Professional associations, like ADIDE, can have as well as the previous interests, some different aims and concerns, such as ensuring the professional development of members through suitable formation and <a href=\"/wiki/Training\" title=\"Training\">training</a>, the organization of scientific meetings and congresses, and the <a href=\"/wiki/Publishing\" title=\"Publishing\">publishing</a> of professional magazines and books.\n</p><p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Inspectorate\" title=\"Inspectorate\">Inspectorate</a> of Education is a body (or two, actually) of <a href=\"/wiki/Civil_servants\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Civil servants\">civil servants</a> of about 1600 people in Spain. This body of inspectors supervise all the <a href=\"/wiki/Education_in_Spain\" title=\"Education in Spain\">Spanish education system</a> except the <a href=\"/wiki/Spanish_universities\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Spanish universities\">university studies</a>. Every inspector is usually in charge of several <a href=\"/wiki/Schools\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Schools\">schools</a> and other <a href=\"/wiki/Educational_institutions\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Educational institutions\">educational institutions</a>, and performs his/her duties according to an annual Inspection Plan. Quite often, however inspectors have to tackle with all kind of incidents and unscheduled situations which requires much attention from them.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Founding\">Founding</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Asociaci%C3%B3n_de_Inspectores_de_Educaci%C3%B3n&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Founding\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>After the establishment of <a href=\"/wiki/Democracy\" title=\"Democracy\">democracy</a>, the Spanish education system undertook very important changes in the 1980s, a time when a significant group of teachers and school administrators started to carry out the supervision function of schools. The already existing associations of inspectors of education at that time did not ensure the professional development of the new inspectors, so it was necessary for them to found a new association. ADIDE was created in 1990 and soon started to replace the absence of unions to achieve the promotion of professional interests and helping to put into practice the new educational policies as settled in the <a href=\"/wiki/Education_reform\" title=\"Education reform\">Education reform</a> provided by the Organic Act of General Organization of the Educational System 1990.\n</p><p>Initially, ADIDE was a unique national organization for the whole of Spain, but due to the Association Act 2005, it had to adopt a <a href=\"/wiki/Federation\" title=\"Federation\">federated</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Structure\" title=\"Structure\">structure</a>, which provoked some problems of interaction on the very first moments. The new technologies and members\u2019 cooperation worked well to maintain a good level of coordination among all the federal associations, one for every one of the <a href=\"/wiki/Autonomous_communities_of_Spain\" title=\"Autonomous communities of Spain\">Spanish Autonomous Regions</a>, which hold a high level of independence in educational matters. The federated association is since then known as ADIDE-Federaci\u00f3n, while every autonomous region association is known by the name of ADIDE followed by the name of the region it operates on.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"External_links\">External links</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Asociaci%C3%B3n_de_Inspectores_de_Educaci%C3%B3n&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: External links\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.adide.org/revista\">Magazine \"Avances en Supervisi\u00f3n educativa\" (written in Spanish with abstracs in English)</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.adide.org\">Official web of ADIDE-Federaci\u00f3n (Spanish)</a></li></ul>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw1244\nCached time: 20180909100348\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.004 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.011 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 29/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 0/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:10011517-0!canonical and timestamp 20180909100348 and revision id 807933117\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[{"lang":"es","url":"https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asociaci%C3%B3n_de_Inspectores_de_Educaci%C3%B3n","langname":"Spanish","autonym":"espa\u00f1ol","*":"Asociaci\u00f3n de Inspectores de Educaci\u00f3n"}],"categories":[{"sortkey":"Asociacion de Inspectores de Educacion","*":"Educational_assessment_and_evaluation"},{"sortkey":"Asociacion de Inspectores de Educacion","*":"Educational_administration"},{"sortkey":"Asociacion de Inspectores de Educacion","*":"Professional_associations_based_in_Spain"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Autonomous communities of Spain"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Civil servants"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Democracy"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Education"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Education in Spain"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Education reform"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Educational institutions"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Employment"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Ethics"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Federation"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Inspectorate"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Professional association"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Publishing"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Schools"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Spain"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Spanish universities"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Structure"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Trade union"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Training"}],"templates":[],"images":[],"externallinks":["http://www.adide.org/revista","http://www.adide.org"],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Background","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Asociaci\u00f3n_de_Inspectores_de_Educaci\u00f3n","byteoffset":476,"anchor":"Background"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Founding","number":"2","index":"2","fromtitle":"Asociaci\u00f3n_de_Inspectores_de_Educaci\u00f3n","byteoffset":1752,"anchor":"Founding"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"External links","number":"3","index":"3","fromtitle":"Asociaci\u00f3n_de_Inspectores_de_Educaci\u00f3n","byteoffset":3246,"anchor":"External_links"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Asociaci\u00f3n de Inspectores de Educaci\u00f3n","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"defaultsort","*":"Asociacion de Inspectores de Educacion"},{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q4807524"}]}}
