UNITECH International is a cooperation program between distinguished technical universities in Europe. The purpose of the exchange is that after obtaining funded technical skills at his home university, focus on management-oriented studies in an international environment. The program consists of a semester (at least) with management studies at a guest university, followed by a term's business practice at one of the companies participating in UNITECH International. The number of participating universities is limited to one per country (to maintain quality) and each school may send two students to each cooperation university. The selection is preceded by an assessment center, where various case studies are discussed in groups as well as individually to be assessed by the participating HR representatives.
