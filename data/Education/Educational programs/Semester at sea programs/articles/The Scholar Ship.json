The itinerary of port stops spanned 4 continents and was developed to provide global perspectives on topics explored through onboard academic programs.  \n</p><p><b>Greece to Portugal:</b>\nEmbarking from Athens, Greece, the ship made its way through the Mediterranean Sea to arrive at its first port of call: Lisbon, Portugal. Students and staff explored Lisbon via Academic Field Programs that included visits to the University of Lisbon, various museums and businesses. \n</p><p><b>Panama:</b>\nPanama City, Panama was the next port stop for the ship.  Students spent time learning about local tribal culture, economic and industrial growth. Through lectures and discussions with the Panama Canal Authority, students also delved into the commercial history of the region. \n</p><p><b>Ecuador &amp; The Galapagos:</b>\nAfter navigating the <a href=\"/wiki/Panama_Canal\" title=\"Panama Canal\">Panama Canal</a>, the Scholar Ship continued on to port in Guayaquil, Ecuador. After passing over the equator and into the southern hemisphere, many onboard took the opportunity to spend time in the <a href=\"/wiki/Galapagos_Islands\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Galapagos Islands\">Galapagos Islands</a>. The ship then continued traveling southwest to Papeete, Tahiti. \n</p><p><b>Tahiti &amp; New Zealand:</b>\nAfter a brief port stop in Tahiti, the Scholar Ship embarked for Auckland, New Zealand, where students made connections with local businesses and examined the culture of  indigenous New Zealanders, the <a href=\"/wiki/M%C4%81ori_people\" title=\"M\u0101ori people\">Maori</a>, through their Academic Field Programs. During independent travel time, students visited Rotorua for <a href=\"/wiki/Zorbing\" title=\"Zorbing\">zorbing</a> and went blackwater rafting in the caves of Waitomo. \n</p><p><b>Australia:</b>\nThe next port of call was Sydney, Australia. Academic Field Programs took the Scholar Ship students to local businesses and interactions with aboriginal tribes of Australia. Students also traveled independently to Perth, the <a href=\"/wiki/Great_Barrier_Reef\" title=\"Great Barrier Reef\">Great Barrier Reef</a>, and Melbourne. \n</p><p><b>China:</b>\nDeparting Sydney, the ship made way for its last continental stop, Asia. The ship docked in Shanghai, on the banks of the historic <a href=\"/wiki/Yangtze_River\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Yangtze River\">Yangtze River</a>. Academic Field Programs in Shanghai offered insight into the Chinese approach to business, international relations, and other fields. Also, an excursion in freezing temperatures had students slipping and sliding along the Great Wall. After Shanghai, the Scholar Ship headed south for Hong Kong, the final port on the September 2007 voyage itinerary.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"January_2008\">January 2008</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=The_Scholar_Ship&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: January 2008\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>On January 2, 2008, the Scholar Ship\u2019s 16-week second voyage around the world began in the city of Hong Kong.   \n</p><p><b>Shanghai, China:</b> The Scholar Ship first headed north to the port of Shanghai, China.

Academic Field Programs brought students to <a href=\"/wiki/Chulalongkorn_University\" title=\"Chulalongkorn University\">Chulalongkorn University</a> in Bangkok, the Grand Palace and Reclining Buddha Temple, and Chiang Rai, where they visited Baan Had Bay, a Tai Lue Ethnic Village on the <a href=\"/wiki/Mekong_River\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Mekong River\">Mekong River</a>.\n</p><p><b>Chennai, India:</b> Continuing south, sailing the Straits of Singapore and the Bay of Bengal, the Scholar Ship called on the port of  Chennai, India. It arrived at the city, formerly known as <a href=\"/wiki/Madras\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Madras\">Madras</a>, on February 5. Academic Field Programs in India took students from the Scholar Ship to lectures at the University of Madras, local businesses in Bangalore, a school in Kanchipuram for children rescued from <a href=\"/wiki/Sweatshops\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sweatshops\">sweatshops</a>, and to Firefly, a sustainable spiritual commune a few hours outside of Chennai. \n</p><p><b>Equator Crossing &amp; Port Victoria, Seychelles:</b> The Scholar Ship celebrated an equatorial crossing on February 16 and headed on to a brief, mid-voyage break in Port Victoria, Seychelles, one of the smallest capitals in the world. \n</p><p><b>Cape Town, South Africa:</b> The Scholar Ship arrived in Cape Town February 27. Students explored South Africa\u2019s role in regional and international affairs and got an overview of the changes in the socio economic \u2018make up\u2019 of the area. Also, the Scholar Ship Research Institute and <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_Cape_Town\" title=\"University of Cape Town\">University of Cape Town</a> hosted an international workshop entitled: \u201cConfronting the HIV/AIDS Epidemic: Policy Responses in South Africa and India\u201d, February 28\u201329. Many students also participated in a service project which was co-hosted with the Wynberg Rotaract club.\n</p><p><b>Cape Verde Islands &amp; Barcelona Spain:</b> The next scheduled port stop for the Scholar Ship is the Cape Verde Islands, part of Western Africa, for a brief break.  It is then on to Barcelona, Spain, March 21, where students will study Barcelona\u2019s waterfront restoration, company management and the economic environment in Spain, as well as Spanish history and art. \n</p><p><b>Istanbul, Turkey:</b> Crossing the Mediterranean Sea, the Scholar Ship arrived in Istanbul, Turkey on April 1. Academic Field Programs were slated to highlight Turkish history and the economy.  \n</p><p><b>Lisbon, Portugal:</b> The Scholar Ship journeyed back across the Mediterranean to arrive in Lisbon, Portugal on April 15.

Following the inaugural voyage in September 2007, the Scholar Ship established \u201cThe Bridge\u201d, an alumni network designed to maintain this community by keeping past students, staff, and faculty connected through technology.\n</p><p>One component of the Bridge is a 24/7 chat room called the Cove. It is designated for exclusive use by shipmates of specific voyages. Alumni can also choose to join an <a href=\"/wiki/Online_community\" title=\"Online community\">online community</a> called interculture. Interculture is a connecting point for alumni, current and prospective students, as well as staff, faculty and the balance of the Scholar Ship community. \n</p><p>The Scholar Ship offered alumni newsletters and updates, but the community itself has many outlets of self-expression. The September 2007 class published a photo book entitled <i>Hononga</i> that sought to capture the journey through images by staff and students alike. <a href=\"/wiki/Blogging\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Blogging\">Blogging</a> is a common way for some alumni, staff, faculty and current students of the Scholar Ship to tell their stories. They also utilize the Bridge as a media sharing portal for the group. FotoShare and the Scholar Ship Video Library allow posting, organizing, and sharing of pictures and videos. The Bridge also provides an official alumni directory with the capability to create and update personal profiles so alumni, staff and faculty can keep in contact.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Financial_difficulties\">Financial difficulties</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=The_Scholar_Ship&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: Financial difficulties\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>On June 11, 2008, the Scholar Ship indefinitely canceled all future voyages due to difficulties in raising the necessary finances.
