 YGLP (Young Global Leadership Program) is an international leadership program for university and high school students. It is founded and developed by Human Science Lab, London, with support from several foundations and  transnational organisations. It uses outcomes from some of its core research on human cognition, leadership and critical thinking.   YGLP is run in five regional groupings – Asia, Americas, Europe, Africa and the Oceania. The assignment of countries or territories to YGLP regional groupings is done in accordance with United Nations geoscheme.    Various research programs on human cognition, leadership, critical thinking, physical spatiality and intelligence at Human Science Lab, London, provides the scientific framework for YGLP.  YGLP is based on the Four Step Leadership Theory formulated at Human Science Lab. According to the theory  “the leadership achievement of an individual is proportional to the optimal use of four principal components that makes a leader – motivation, planning, energising and executing”. YGLP is designed to optimise this four key leadership component with each program module focusing on a single component.    YGLP is executed through two fellow programs. The YGLP Senior fellow program is meant for university students in the age of 19 to 25 years and the Junior fellow program is for high school student in the age of 13 to 19 years. Eligible students for YGLP fellow program are selected through a leadership aptitude evaluation process.   The YGLP fellow program is made of four core modules and one non-core module involving various instructional and resource materials, leadership workshops and leadership conferences.   YGLP is run in 44 Asian countries and 2 Special Administrative Regions as YGLP Asia. This is the list of countries where YGLP Asia is administered.
