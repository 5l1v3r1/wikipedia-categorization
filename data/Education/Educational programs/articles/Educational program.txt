An educational program is a program written by the institution or ministry of education which determines the learning progress of each subject in all the stages of formal education. Besides the primary educational program, some schools use a different educational program written by another source which uses different learning progress - either in some subjects, such as the Mofet educational program in Israel or in all subjects, such as special education. Educational programs help people decide if they are going to be a teacher or not. They're mostly in high schools called C4 program. C4 programs help students in high schools decide what they are going to be before they get to college, so they do not waste their time taking classes they do not need in college or wasting their parents' money on classes and books they do not need.
