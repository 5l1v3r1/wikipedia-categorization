It is the physical act of having the students' plant their own fruits and vegetables that gives them ownership and gets them more involved in their learning. Students can then learn about the nutritional values of food and multiple ways to prepare their own products in healthy ways to further progress their awareness of health issues. These two examples of physical acts of learning are what motivate healthier eating choices in and outside of the school setting.<sup id=\"cite_ref-fisher_1-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-fisher-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-Berezowitz_3-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Berezowitz-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Student_Health\">Student Health</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Garden-based_learning&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Student Health\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>Teachers also regarded the garden to be very effective at enhancing academic performance, physical activity, language arts, and healthy eating habits.

Gardening intervention in schools may also aid in the improved health of children for the simple reason that students get 20% or more of their daily food intake from school depending on their socioeconomic backgrounds; families with lower income depending on school lunch even more than others.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Berezowitz_3-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Berezowitz-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Increased_environmental_awareness\">Increased environmental awareness</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Garden-based_learning&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Increased environmental awareness\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Research highlights that high school students gain more positive attitudes about environmental issues after participating in a school garden program.

The reasoning behind these improvements is connected to the holistic, integrated, hands-on, project based, cooperative and experiential learning activities that are all aspects of garden based education.
