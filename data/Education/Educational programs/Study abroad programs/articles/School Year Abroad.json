Students intensively learn the respective language of their country and live with a carefully selected host family. The program includes extensive cultural immersion, select courses taught in the native language and requisite subjects such as math and English taught in English.

Students earn U.S. high school credits while attending SYA and preparing for selective U.S. colleges and universities.

The original incarnation was \"Schoolboys Abroad\" and consisted of 11 students accompanied by founder Clark Vaughan and his wife Polly, plus two more teachers, who in 1964, traveled by ship on the <i>MS Aurelia</i> to study in Barcelona, Spain. Polly Vaughan chose the symbol that continues to serve as the logo for the program. Their son Christopher was in the fourth Andover class to participate in SYA.\n</p><p>Though founded in <a href=\"/wiki/Barcelona\" title=\"Barcelona\">Barcelona</a>, the program relocated to <a href=\"/wiki/Zaragoza\" title=\"Zaragoza\">Zaragoza</a> in 1999. The move took place in order to facilitate the ease with which students learned and heard Castilian Spanish spoke around them. As the program grew in <a href=\"/wiki/Barcelona\" title=\"Barcelona\">Barcelona</a>, it became clear that the proliferation of Catalan, as well as the number of tourists, detracted from the immersion of the students. The move to <a href=\"/wiki/Zaragoza\" title=\"Zaragoza\">Zaragoza</a>, the fifth largest city in Spain, provided students with a city environment with less tourist attraction, making it necessary for Castilian Spanish to be spoken throughout the city.\n</p><p>SYA Spain students attend classes on the sprawling, 425-square-meter second floor of a Neoclassical building in Zaragoza's city center on Paseo de Pamplona.\n</p><p><b>School-to-School Exchanges</b>\nSYA students here are able to participate in various school-to-school exchanges all over the country, providing excellent opportunities to become friends with Spanish students their own age. These range from exchanges lasting one to five days to evening seminars organized once a week.\n</p><p>Through \"One Day Here, One Day There\", an SYA student spends a day at a high school in Zaragoza,  hosted by a counterpart their age; that same Spanish student attends classes at SYA the next day.\n</p><p>The program \u201cFive days in . . .\u201d Burgos, Madrid, Toledo or Sevilla enables an SYA student to go to one of these cities to attend classes and live with a local host family for five full days.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"France\">France</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=School_Year_Abroad&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: France\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>SYA France is located in <a href=\"/wiki/Rennes\" title=\"Rennes\">Rennes</a>, the capital of <a href=\"/wiki/Brittany\" title=\"Brittany\">Brittany</a>. Founded in 1967, it is SYA's second oldest program. SYA France is open to students who are currently enrolled in at least level II of French. The majority of students take seven credits, including English and math. All but the English and math courses are taught in French.\n</p><p>Students are required to take English, math, French language, French literature, art history, history and French society and culture.\n</p><p>Based on language proficiency tests administered in September and language-study previous records, students are placed in one of four groups (Arthur, Morgane, Lancelot, or Viviane which are named after characters from the fabled Knights of the Round Table which is thought to have taken place in Brittany) for the courses taught in French. Adjustments in the groups are generally made early in the year if appropriate. Math placement is based on prior experience and a placement test. Courses meet for a minimum of four 45-minute periods per week. All courses except for Advanced Algebra with Functions and Precalculus and Advanced Topics in Mathematics are taught at the honors or AP level.\n</p><p>SYA France school trips are scheduled in accordance with the French academic calendar; during French school vacations, students travel all over France.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"China\">China</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=School_Year_Abroad&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: China\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In 1994, the Chinese government allowed School Year Abroad to begin a program in <a href=\"/wiki/Beijing\" title=\"Beijing\">Beijing</a>. It was the first of its kind at either a high school or college level, with students being placed in host families for the full school year. The program operates out of the <a href=\"/wiki/Second_High_School_Attached_to_Beijing_Normal_University\" title=\"Second High School Attached to Beijing Normal University\">Second High School Attached to Beijing Normal University</a>. SYA China is open to both beginners and students who have already studied Mandarin. All students take Mandarin Chinese Language, Chinese History and Chinese Society and Culture along with English and math, for a total of six credits. These courses meet four or five periods each week with the exception of Chinese Culture and Society, which meets two periods each week in addition to guest lectures and field trips. All courses except for Advanced Algebra with Functions, Precalculus and Advanced Topics in Mathematics, and Chinese Society and Culture are taught at the honors or AP level.\n</p><p>Martial arts, traditional Chinese brush painting, calligraphy and music are offered as noncredit courses, pass/fail. Each course meets once per week. Home schools may accept these courses for credit if deemed appropriate. School Year Abroad does not distinguish between eleventh- and twelfth-grade students in the organization of classes.\n</p><p>Students are placed in class according to their proficiency in Chinese, which is assessed by a diagnostic exam administered at the beginning of the school year.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Italy\">Italy</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=School_Year_Abroad&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Italy\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Since it opened in 2001, SYA's Italian program has been housed in a 16th- century <a href=\"/wiki/Palazzo\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Palazzo\">palazzo</a> in the city of <a href=\"/wiki/Viterbo\" title=\"Viterbo\">Viterbo</a> in <a href=\"/wiki/Lazio\" title=\"Lazio\">Lazio</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=School_Year_Abroad&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><cite class=\"citation web\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://www.sya.org/about/leadership\">\"Leadership - School Year Abroad\"</a>. <i>www.sya.org</i><span class=\"reference-accessdate\">.
