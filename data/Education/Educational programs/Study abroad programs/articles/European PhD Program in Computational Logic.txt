(The program has been discontinued) The European PhD Program in Computational Logic (EPCL) is a three-year distributed and structured doctorate program that started in fall 2011. It is run by four European partner universities that have a long research track in computational logic and also run the European Master's Program in Computational Logic (EMCL) since 2004: Doctoral candidates choose two of these partner universities and a third associated non-European partner research organization (Simon Fraser University, Universidad de Chile, NICTA) or an industrial partner of the program (IBM Italia, Lixto Software GmbH, Ontoprise GmbH). The program involves stays at these three institutions, which also will be involved in supervision of the PhD project. Graduates of EPCL receive a joint degree of the two selected partner universities which subsumes two acknowledged national doctoral degrees of the respective universities' countries. EPCL is supported by the  German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD).
