Users can search for participating institutions and compare important data and information, including admissions, cost, financial aid, popular majors, and campus safety. Links to the institutions' websites provide a \"virtual campus tour.\"\n</p><p>U-CAN was publicly launched on September 26, 2007. At the time of the launch, more than 600 institutions had volunteered to participate. The network was developed by the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities (<a href=\"/wiki/NAICU\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"NAICU\">NAICU</a>).\n</p><p>On September 17, 2008, U-CAN launched enhanced features designed in response to focus groups. Features included an advanced search that increased the number of searchable fields from three to 17.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>U-CAN represents the first time that colleges and universities have voluntarily joined and self-developed a system to provide data and information for prospective students.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> Other systems are under development by the <a href=\"/wiki/Association_of_Public_and_Land-grant_Universities\" title=\"Association of Public and Land-grant Universities\">National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges</a>, the <a href=\"/wiki/American_Association_of_State_Colleges_and_Universities\" title=\"American Association of State Colleges and Universities\">American Association of State Colleges and Universities</a>, and the <a href=\"/wiki/Association_of_American_Universities\" title=\"Association of American Universities\">American Association of Universities</a>.
