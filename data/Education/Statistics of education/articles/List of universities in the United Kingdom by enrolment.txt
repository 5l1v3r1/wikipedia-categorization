  This is a list of institutions in the United Kingdom by the number of students enrolled in higher education courses. The source for the figures is the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) statistics for 2016/17.  The student numbers include full-time and part-time, and are broken down into undergraduate and postgraduate students. Some institutes enrol students in both higher education and further education courses, so student numbers may be higher for such institutes. Numbers are of actual enrollments, not FTEs. The data show that 2.28Â million people were enrolled in higher education at the 167 higher education providers reporting statistics to HESA.  Statistics are for students within the UK only and do not include distance-learning students studying overseas. There were 663,915 overseas students recorded by HESA in 2014/15, of which 42.7% were studying on Association of Chartered Certified Accountants courses and registered at Oxford Brookes University. Other significant overseas programs include the University of London International Programmes, with 52,000 students in 2014/15.
