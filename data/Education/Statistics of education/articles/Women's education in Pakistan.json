govern the social structure in Pakistani society in the rural areas. In comparison, urban centers of the country as well as semi-peripheral regions are slowly moving towards shifting gender roles that are more inclusive. Around 70% of working women in Pakistan work outdoors according to the <a href=\"/wiki/Asian_Development_Bank\" title=\"Asian Development Bank\">Asian Development Bank</a> policy brief on female workforce participation in Pakistan 2016. The general perception of culturally traditional gender roles that, specifically, a woman is expected to take care of the home as wife and mother, whereas the male dominates outside the home as a breadwinner, are questionable in certain sectors. In agricultural work, within rural areas, both men and women work in the fields and are expected to contribute equally to household work. In a survey by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics 2013-2014, it was reported that 26% of women are in the labor force ( approximately 15 million). There is a traditionally conceptual idea of segregation of men and women into two distinct worlds. However, this materializes differently in different parts of the country. Only in the most of rural-isolated regions in the country  is this idea of gender roles strictly followed. Poverty is one of the major factors in unequal household resources allocation in the favor of sons due to their role in society outside the home. Therefore, education for boys is prioritized over girls, because it is perceived that boys must be equipped with educational skills to compete for resources in the public arena; while girls have to specialize in domestic skills to be good mothers and wives. Hence, education is not perceived as being important for girls.\n</p><p>This gender <a href=\"/wiki/Division_of_labor\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Division of labor\">division of labor</a> has been internalized by the society, and girls do not have many choices for themselves that could change these patriarchal realities of their lives. Society does not allow girls to develop their human <a href=\"/wiki/Capability_approach\" title=\"Capability approach\">capabilities</a> by precluding them from acquiring education. Lack of emphasis on the importance of women's education is one of the cardinal features of <a href=\"/wiki/Gender_inequality\" title=\"Gender inequality\">gender inequality</a> in Pakistan.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> The Human Development Report (HDR) listed Pakistan in the category of \"low <a href=\"/wiki/Human_development_(humanity)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Human development (humanity)\">human development</a>\" countries with a female <a href=\"/wiki/Literacy\" title=\"Literacy\">literacy</a> rate of thirty percent, and Pakistan has ranked 145 in the world in terms of human development.<sup id=\"cite_ref-UNDP-Pak-2011_2-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-UNDP-Pak-2011-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Importance_of_women.27s_education\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Importance_of_women's_education\">Importance of women's education</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Women%27s_education_in_Pakistan&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Importance of women&#039;s education\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Education has been of central significance to the development of human society. It can be the beginning, not only of individual knowledge, information and awareness, but also a holistic strategy for development and change.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> Education is very much connected to women's ability to form social relationships on the basis of equality with others and to achieve the important social good of self-respect. It is important, as well, to <a href=\"/wiki/Economic_mobility\" title=\"Economic mobility\">mobility</a> (through access to jobs and the political process) and to health and life (through the connection to bodily integrity). Education can allow women to participate in politics so they can ensure that their voices and concerns are heard and addressed in the public policy. It is also crucial for women's access to the legal system.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Nussbaum,_M._2003_5-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Nussbaum,_M._2003-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> Although it must be considered that religion and traditions of the Pakistani affect women's education. Some women may choose to keep the traditional roles because that is what they have always known and are used to. It would be a great opportunity if women were able to make their choice on their own, though. They should at least have the knowledge of both sides to be educated or to stay with the traditional ways.\n</p><p>Education is a critical input in <a href=\"/wiki/Training_and_development\" title=\"Training and development\">human resource development</a> and essential for the country's economic growth. It increases the <a href=\"/wiki/Productivity\" title=\"Productivity\">productivity</a> and efficiency of individuals, and it produces a skilled labor force that is capable of leading the economy towards sustainable growth and prosperity. The progress and wellbeing of a country largely depends on the education choices made available to its people. It can be one of the most powerful instruments of change. It can help a country to achieve its national goals via producing minds imbued with knowledge, skills, and competencies to shape its future destiny. The widespread recognition of this fact has created awareness on the need to focus upon literacy and elementary education, not simply as a matter of <a href=\"/wiki/Social_justice\" title=\"Social justice\">social justice</a> but more to foster economic growth, social well-being, and social stability.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> Women's education is so inextricably linked with the other facets of human development that to make it a priority is to also make change on a range of other fronts; from the health and status of women to early childhood care; from nutrition, water and sanitation to community empowerment; from the reduction of <a href=\"/wiki/Child_labour\" title=\"Child labour\">child labor</a> and other forms of exploitation to the peaceful resolution of conflicts.<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Economic_benefits_of_women.27s_education\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Economic_benefits_of_women's_education\">Economic benefits of women's education</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Women%27s_education_in_Pakistan&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Economic benefits of women&#039;s education\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">See also: <a href=\"/wiki/Women%27s_education_and_development\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Women&#39;s education and development\">Women's education and development</a></div>\n<p>Apart from the acquisition of knowledge and values conductive to social evolution, education also enables development of mind, training in logical and analytical thinking. It allows an individual to acquire organizational, managerial, and administrative skills. Moreover, enhanced self-esteem and improved social and financial status within a community is a direct outcome of education. Therefore, by promoting education among women, Pakistan can achieve social and human development, and gender equality. A large number of empirical studies have revealed that increase in women's education boosts their wages and that returns to education for women are frequently larger than that of men. Increase in the level of <a href=\"/wiki/Female_education\" title=\"Female education\">female education</a> improves human development outcomes such as child survival, health and schooling.<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> Lower female education has a negative impact on economic growth as it lowers the average level of human capital.<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> Developmental Economists argue that in developing countries female education reduces fertility, infant mortality and increases children's education.<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> Gender inequality in education directly and significantly affects <a href=\"/wiki/Economic_growth\" title=\"Economic growth\">economic growth</a>. Empirical studies done by using regression analysis reveal the fact that the overall <a href=\"/wiki/Literacy_rate\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Literacy rate\">literacy rate</a>, enrollment ratio, ratio of literate female to male have positive and significant impact on economic growth.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Chaudhry,_I.S._2007_11-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Chaudhry,_I.S._2007-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> Chaudhry (2007) investigated the impact of gender inequality in education on economic growth in Pakistan. The secondary source of time series data drawn from various issues has been used. In his regression analysis, he estimated a set of regressions showing a moderate explanatory power. The variables, overall literacy rate, enrollment ratio, ratio of literate female to male have positive and significant impact on economic growth. It was found that gender inequality in initial education reduces economic growth.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Chaudhry,_I.S._2007_11-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Chaudhry,_I.S._2007-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>\nIn another empirical study, Chaudhry (2009) investigated factors affecting rural poverty in Southern Punjab (Pakistan), and he concluded that alleviation of poverty is possible by lowering the household size and dependency ratio, improving education, increasing female labor participation. He employed Logit regression models and used primary source of data from the project area of Asian Development Bank for estimation. Results indicate that as dependency level and household size increase the probability of being poor increases too. Education has the significant inverse relationship with poverty because it provides employment opportunities and rejects poverty.<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> The inclusion of trained and education women workforce will not only ensure women's welfare, it will also increase the overall productivity of the workforce due to more competitiveness. Hence, the developmental and feminist economists argue that it is desirable for the government to allocate more resources towards women's education, as it is going to benefit the whole society.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Gender_disparity_in_education_in_Pakistan\">Gender disparity in education in Pakistan</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Women%27s_education_in_Pakistan&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Gender disparity in education in Pakistan\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>According to <a href=\"/wiki/UNDP\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"UNDP\">UNDP</a> 2010 report, Pakistan ranked 120 in 146 countries in terms of <a href=\"/wiki/Gender-related_Development_Index\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Gender-related Development Index\">Gender-related Development Index</a> (GDI), and in terms of <a href=\"/wiki/Gender_Empowerment_Measure\" title=\"Gender Empowerment Measure\">Gender Empowerment Measurement</a> (GEM) ranking, it ranked 92 in 94 countries.<sup id=\"cite_ref-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup> Gender inequality in education can be measured in different ways.

As mentioned above, gender division of labour enforces women to primarily specialize in unpaid care work as mothers and wives at home, whereas men perform paid work, and come out as breadwinners. This has led to a low level of resource investment in girls' education not only by their families but also by the state. This low investment in women's <a href=\"/wiki/Human_capital\" title=\"Human capital\">human capital</a>, compounded by negative social biases and cultural practices, restrictions on women's mobility and the internalization of <a href=\"/wiki/Patriarchy\" title=\"Patriarchy\">patriarchy</a> by women themselves, becomes the basis for <a href=\"/wiki/Gender_discrimination\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Gender discrimination\">gender discrimination</a> and disparities in most spheres of life. Some of the ramifications are that women are unable to develop job-market skills, hence, they have limited opportunities available to them in the wage-labour market. Moreover, social and cultural restrictions limit women's chances to compete for resources in a world outside the four walls of their homes. It translates into social and economic dependency of women on men. The nature and degree of women's oppression and subordination vary across classes, regions and the rural and urban divide in Pakistan. It has been observed that male dominant structures are relatively more marked in the rural and tribal setting where local customs and indigenous laws establish stronger male authority and power over women.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Khan,_S_2007_15-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Khan,_S_2007-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Insurgency_hurdles\">Insurgency hurdles</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Women%27s_education_in_Pakistan&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Insurgency hurdles\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Destruction of schools and killings have harmed women's education in Pakistan. 16-year-old education activist and blogger <a href=\"/wiki/Malala_Yousafzai\" title=\"Malala Yousafzai\">Malala Yousafzai</a> was shot in the head and neck by <a href=\"/wiki/Tehrik-i-Taliban_Pakistan\" title=\"Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan\">Taliban</a> insurgents 9 October 2012 after she had blogged about the destruction of schools and closing of all-girls schools in her town of <a href=\"/wiki/Mingora\" title=\"Mingora\">Mingora</a> in the <a href=\"/wiki/Swat_District\" title=\"Swat District\">Swat District</a>.

Women who live in urban areas are often enrolled in private schools getting a better education there as they have a lot more educational accessibility. Women in urban areas are also surrounded by people who are educated and are not put down or beaten for going to school. Unlike in urban areas, women in rural areas are discouraged to attend school. Most of them are brought up in conservative families with little to no education. They have to work harder than women in urban areas because they have little support system. If their parents are accepting of education they still cannot go since most of them are very poor and cannot afford the expense. The women also don\u2019t attend school in rural areas of Pakistan because it is not culturally accepted.

One of the possible explanations of this pattern is relatively stronger dominance of tribal, feudal and patriarchal traditions in rural areas. Moreover, there are very few employment opportunities for women in rural areas, and thus, there is very little financial incentive for families to send their girls to schools. However, despite the meagre representation of females in the education sector, the level of achievement of female students is consistently far higher than that of their counterpart male students. Girls generally outclass boys in examination, and they are also higher achievers in universities. Unfortunately, the majority of the girls never get an opportunity to develop their educational capabilities.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Khan,_S_2007_15-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Khan,_S_2007-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Role_of_government_in_women.27s_education\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Role_of_government_in_women's_education\">Role of government in women's education</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Women%27s_education_in_Pakistan&amp;action=edit&amp;section=16\" title=\"Edit section: Role of government in women&#039;s education\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Officially the government of Pakistan is committed to provide every citizen an access to education, but critics say that its budget allocation towards education does not correspond with its former commitment. The expenditure on education as a percentage of <a href=\"/wiki/GDP\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"GDP\">GDP</a> was 1.82% in 2000\u20132001, while it has been raised slightly in 2006\u20132007 to 2.42%, and it is still relatively lower than most neighboring countries.<sup id=\"cite_ref-FBS_20-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-FBS-20\">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup> Feminist economists argue that the government of Pakistan needs to fully address and resolve the gender concerns that exist in the educational sector. They suggest that one of the ways to improve this situation is by increasing funding for women's education, encourage and financially incentivize people in the rural areas to send their girls to schools.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Khan,_S_2007_15-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Khan,_S_2007-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup> In the apprentice of gender studies, the gender division of labor is considered patriarchal, and feminists argue that it can be consciously neutralized by the public policies, i.e. encouraging girls to study mathematics, science, computers, and business administration etc. This way, girls will specialize in higher paying fields (jobs) instead of solely focusing on care work.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Nussbaum,_M._2003_5-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Nussbaum,_M._2003-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Role_of_parents\">Role of parents</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Women%27s_education_in_Pakistan&amp;action=edit&amp;section=17\" title=\"Edit section: Role of parents\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In 2016, parents seized the initiative by sending their daughters to what has become a co-education school in Mangar Kota, <a href=\"/wiki/Swat_District\" title=\"Swat District\">Swat</a>.

They also point towards empirical studies that have confirmed that gender inequality in education has significant impact on rural poverty in Pakistan, and female literacy is important for poverty alleviation.
