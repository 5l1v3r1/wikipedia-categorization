text\">\u03b8\u03ad\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2</span>, meaning \"something put forth\", and refers to an intellectual <a href=\"/wiki/Proposition\" title=\"Proposition\">proposition</a>. \"Dissertation\" comes from the <a href=\"/wiki/Latin\" title=\"Latin\">Latin</a> <i>dissert\u0101ti\u014d</i>, meaning \"path\". Aristotle was the first philosopher to define the term thesis. </p><blockquote><p>\"A 'thesis' is a supposition of some eminent philosopher that conflicts with the general opinion...for to take notice when any ordinary person expresses views contrary to men's usual opinions would be silly\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup></p></blockquote><p>For Aristotle, a thesis would therefore be a supposition that is stated in contradiction with general opinion or express disagreement with other philosophers (104b33-35). A supposition is a statement or opinion that may or may not be true depending on the evidence and/or proof that is offered (152b32). The purpose of the dissertation is thus to outline the proofs of why the author disagrees with other philosophers or the general opinion.\n</p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Structure_and_presentation_style\">Structure and presentation style</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Thesis&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Structure and presentation style\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Irony_thesis.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Irony_thesis.png/220px-Irony_thesis.png\" width=\"220\" height=\"369\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Irony_thesis.png/330px-Irony_thesis.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Irony_thesis.png/440px-Irony_thesis.png 2x\" data-file-width=\"845\" data-file-height=\"1418\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Irony_thesis.png\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Cover page to <a href=\"/wiki/S%C3%B8ren_Kierkegaard\" title=\"S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard\">S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard</a>'s university thesis (1841).</div></div></div>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Structure\">Structure</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Thesis&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Structure\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>A thesis (or dissertation) may be arranged as a <a href=\"/wiki/Thesis_by_publication\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Thesis by publication\">thesis by publication</a> or a <a href=\"/wiki/Monograph\" title=\"Monograph\">monograph</a>, with or without appended papers, respectively, though many graduate programs allow candidates to submit a curated collection of published papers.

They differ in their structure in accordance with the many different areas of study (arts, humanities, social sciences, technology, sciences, etc.) and the differences between them. In a thesis by publication, the chapters constitute an introductory and comprehensive review of the appended published and unpublished article documents.\n</p><p>Dissertations normally report on a research project or study, or an extended analysis of a topic. The structure of a thesis or dissertation explains the purpose, the previous research literature impinging on the topic of the study, the methods used, and the findings of the project. Most world universities use a multiple chapter format&#160;: a) an introduction, which introduces the research topic, the methodology, as well as its scope and significance; b) a literature review, reviewing relevant literature and showing how this has informed the research issue; c) a methodology chapter, explaining how the research has been designed and why the research methods/population/data collection and analysis being used have been chosen; d) a findings chapter, outlining the findings of the research itself; e) an analysis and discussion chapter, analysing the findings and discussing them in the context of the literature review (this chapter is often divided into two\u2014analysis and discussion); f) a conclusion.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Style\">Style</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Thesis&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Style\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Degree-awarding institutions often define their own <a href=\"/wiki/Style_guide\" title=\"Style guide\">house style</a> that candidates have to follow when preparing a thesis document. In addition to institution-specific house styles, there exist a number of field-specific, national, and international standards and recommendations for the presentation of theses, for instance <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=ISO_7144&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"ISO 7144 (page does not exist)\">ISO 7144</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-iso7144_2-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-iso7144-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> Other applicable international standards include <a href=\"/wiki/ISO_2145\" title=\"ISO 2145\">ISO 2145</a> on section numbers, <a href=\"/wiki/ISO_690\" title=\"ISO 690\">ISO 690</a> on bibliographic references, and <a href=\"/wiki/ISO_31\" title=\"ISO 31\">ISO 31</a> on quantities or units.\n</p><p>Some older house styles specify that <a href=\"/wiki/Book_design#Front_matter\" title=\"Book design\">front matter</a> (title page, abstract, table of content, etc.) uses a separate page number sequence from the main text, using <a href=\"/wiki/Roman_numerals\" title=\"Roman numerals\">Roman numerals</a>. The relevant international standard<sup id=\"cite_ref-iso7144_2-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-iso7144-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> and many newer style guides recognize that this <a href=\"/wiki/Book_design\" title=\"Book design\">book design</a> practice can cause confusion where electronic document viewers number all pages of a document continuously from the first page, independent of any printed page numbers. They, therefore, avoid the traditional separate number sequence for front matter and require a single sequence of <a href=\"/wiki/Arabic_numerals\" title=\"Arabic numerals\">Arabic numerals</a> starting with 1 for the first printed page (the <a href=\"/wiki/Recto\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Recto\">recto</a> of the title page).\n</p><p>Presentation requirements, including pagination, layout, type and color of paper, use of <a href=\"/wiki/Acid-free_paper\" title=\"Acid-free paper\">acid-free paper</a> (where a copy of the dissertation will become a permanent part of the library collection), <a href=\"/wiki/Paper_size\" title=\"Paper size\">paper size</a>, order of components, and citation style, will be checked page by page by the accepting officer before the thesis is accepted and a receipt is issued.\n</p><p>However, strict standards are not always required. Most Italian universities, for example, have only general requirements on the character size and the page formatting, and leave much freedom for the actual typographic details.<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Thesis_committee\">Thesis committee</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Thesis&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Thesis committee\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>A thesis or dissertation committee is a committee that supervises a student's dissertation.

The committee members are doctors in their field (whether a PhD or other designation) and have the task of reading the dissertation, making suggestions for changes and improvements, and sitting in on the defense. Sometimes, at least one member of the committee must be a professor in a department that is different from that of the student.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Regional_and_degree-specific_practices_and_terminologies\">Regional and degree-specific practices and terminologies</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Thesis&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Regional and degree-specific practices and terminologies\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Argentina\">Argentina</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Thesis&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Argentina\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Science_and_technology_in_Argentina\" title=\"Science and technology in Argentina\">Latin American docta</a></i>, the academic dissertation can be referred to as different stages inside the academic program that the student is seeking to achieve into a recognized <a href=\"/wiki/List_of_universities_in_Argentina\" title=\"List of universities in Argentina\">Argentine University</a>, in all the cases the students must develop original contribution in the chosen fields by means of several paper work and essays that comprehend the body of the <i>thesis</i>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> Correspondingly to the academic degree, the last phase of an academic thesis is called in Spanish a <i>defensa de grado</i>, <i>defensa magistral</i> or <i>defensa doctoral</i> in cases in which the university candidate is finalizing his or her <a href=\"/wiki/Licentiate_(degree)\" title=\"Licentiate (degree)\">licentiate</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Master%27s_degree\" title=\"Master&#39;s degree\">master's</a>, or <a href=\"/wiki/Doctorate\" title=\"Doctorate\">PhD program</a>.

Because of the nature of the graduate thesis or dissertation having to be more narrow and more novel, the result of original research, these usually have a smaller proportion of the work that is cited from other sources, though the fact that they are lengthier may mean they still have total citations.\n</p><p>Specific undergraduate courses, especially writing-intensive courses or courses taken by upperclassmen, may also require one or more extensive written assignments referred to variously as theses, essays, or papers. Increasingly, high schools are requiring students to complete a senior project or senior thesis on a chosen topic during the final year as a prerequisite for graduation. The <a href=\"/wiki/Extended_essay\" title=\"Extended essay\">extended essay</a> component of the <a href=\"/wiki/International_Baccalaureate_Diploma_Programme\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme\">International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme</a>, offered in a growing number of American high schools, is another example of this trend.\n</p><p>Generally speaking, a dissertation is judged as to whether or not it makes an original and unique contribution to scholarship. Lesser projects (a master's thesis, for example) are judged by whether or not they demonstrate mastery of available scholarship in the presentation of an idea.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Accuracy_dispute#Disputed_statement\" title=\"Wikipedia:Accuracy dispute\"><span title=\"The material near this tag is possibly inaccurate or nonfactual.

This examination normally occurs after the dissertation is finished but before it is submitted to the university, and may comprise a presentation (often public) by the student and questions posed by an examining committee or jury. In North America, an initial oral examination in the field of specialization may take place just before the student settles down to work on the dissertation. An additional oral exam may take place after the dissertation is completed and is known as a <b>thesis</b> or <b>dissertation</b> \"<b>defense</b>\", which at some universities may be a mere formality and at others may result in the student being required to make significant revisions.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Examination_results\">Examination results</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Thesis&amp;action=edit&amp;section=29\" title=\"Edit section: Examination results\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The result of the examination may be given immediately following deliberation by the examiners (in which case the candidate may immediately be considered to have received his or her degree), or at a later date, in which case the examiners may prepare a defense report that is forwarded to a Board or Committee of Postgraduate Studies, which then officially recommends the candidate for the degree.\n</p><p>Potential decisions (or \"verdicts\") include:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Accepted/pass with no corrections.</li></ul>\n<dl><dd>The thesis is accepted as presented. A grade may be awarded, though in many countries PhDs are not graded at all, and in others, only one of the theoretically possible grades (the highest) is ever used in practice.</dd></dl>\n<ul><li>The thesis must be revised.</li></ul>\n<dl><dd>Revisions (for example, correction of numerous grammatical or spelling errors; clarification of concepts or methodology; an addition of sections) are required. One or more members of the jury or the thesis supervisor will make the decision on the acceptability of revisions and provide written confirmation that they have been satisfactorily completed. If, as is often the case, the needed revisions are relatively modest, the examiners may all sign the thesis with the verbal understanding that the candidate will review the revised thesis with his or her supervisor before submitting the completed version.</dd></dl>\n<ul><li>Extensive revision required.</li></ul>\n<dl><dd>The thesis must be revised extensively and undergo the evaluation and defense process again from the beginning with the same examiners. Problems may include theoretical or methodological issues. A candidate who is not recommended for the degree after the second defense must normally withdraw from the program.</dd></dl>\n<ul><li>Unacceptable.</li></ul>\n<dl><dd>The thesis is unacceptable and the candidate must withdraw from the program. This verdict is given only when the thesis requires major revisions and when the examination makes it clear that the candidate is incapable of making such revisions.</dd></dl>\n<p>At most North American institutions the latter two verdicts are extremely rare, for two reasons. First, to obtain the status of doctoral candidates, graduate students typically write a qualifying examination or comprehensive examination, which often includes an oral defense. Students who pass the qualifying examination are deemed capable of completing scholarly work independently and are allowed to proceed with working on a dissertation. Second, since the thesis supervisor (and the other members of the advisory committee) will normally have reviewed the thesis extensively before recommending the student proceed to the defense, such an outcome would be regarded as a major failure not only on the part of the candidate but also by the candidate's supervisor (who should have recognized the substandard quality of the dissertation long before the defense was allowed to take place). It is also fairly rare for a thesis to be accepted without any revisions; the most common outcome of a defense is for the examiners to specify minor revisions (which the candidate typically completes in a few days or weeks).\n</p><p>At universities on the British pattern it is not uncommon for theses at the <i>viva</i> stage to be subject to major revisions in which a substantial rewrite is required, sometimes followed by a new <i>viva</i>. Very rarely, the thesis may be awarded the lesser degree of M.Phil (<a href=\"/wiki/Master_of_Philosophy\" title=\"Master of Philosophy\">Master of Philosophy</a>) instead, preventing the candidate from resubmitting the thesis.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Australia\">Australia</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Thesis&amp;action=edit&amp;section=30\" title=\"Edit section: Australia\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In Australia, doctoral theses are usually examined by three examiners although some, like the <a href=\"/wiki/Australian_Catholic_University\" title=\"Australian Catholic University\">Australian Catholic University</a> and the <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_New_South_Wales\" title=\"University of New South Wales\">University of New South Wales</a>, have shifted to using only two examiners; without a live defense except in extremely rare exceptions. In the case of a master's degree by research the thesis is usually examined by only two examiners. Typically one of these examiners will be from within the candidate's own department; the other(s) will usually be from other universities and often from overseas. Following submission of the thesis, copies are sent by mail to examiners and then reports sent back to the institution.\n</p><p>Similar to a master's degree by research thesis, a thesis for the research component of a master's degree by coursework is also usually examined by two examiners, one from the candidate's department and one from another university. For an Honours year, which is a fourth year in addition to the usual three-year bachelor's degree, the thesis is also examined by two examiners, though both are usually from the candidate's own department. Honours and Master's theses sometimes require an oral defense before they are accepted.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Germany_2\">Germany</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Thesis&amp;action=edit&amp;section=31\" title=\"Edit section: Germany\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In Germany, a thesis is usually examined with an oral examination.

However, a process that allows for revisions of the thesis is usually only implemented for doctoral degrees.\n</p><p>There are several different kinds of oral examinations used in practice. The <i>Disputation</i>, also called <i>Verteidigung</i> (\"defense\"), is usually public (at least to members of the university) and is focused on the topic of the thesis. In contrast, the <i>Rigorosum</i> is not held in public and also encompasses fields in addition to the topic of the thesis. The <i>Rigorosum</i> is only common for doctoral degrees. Another term for an oral examination is <i>Kolloquium</i>, which generally refers to a usually public scientific discussion and is often used synonymously with <i>Verteidigung</i>.\n</p><p>In each case, what exactly is expected differs between universities and between faculties. Some universities also demand a combination of several of these forms.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Malaysia_2\">Malaysia</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Thesis&amp;action=edit&amp;section=32\" title=\"Edit section: Malaysia\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Like the British model, the PHD or MPhil student is required to submit their theses or dissertation for examination by two or three examiners. The first examiner is from the university concerned, the second examiner is from another local university and the third examiner is from a suitable foreign university (usually from Commonwealth countries). The choice of examiners must be approved by the university senate. In some public universities, a PhD or MPhil candidate may also have to show a number publications in peer reviewed academic journals as part of the requirement. An oral viva is conducted after the examiners have submitted their reports to the university. The oral viva session is attended by the Oral Viva chairman, a rapporteur with a PhD qualification, the first examiner, the second examiner and sometimes the third examiner.\n</p><p>Branch campuses of British, Australian and Middle East universities in Malaysia use the respective models of the home campuses to examine their PhD or MPhil candidates.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Philippines_2\">Philippines</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Thesis&amp;action=edit&amp;section=33\" title=\"Edit section: Philippines\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In the Philippines, a thesis is followed by an oral defense.

Each committee member will have been given a completed copy of the dissertation prior to the defense, and will come prepared to ask questions about the thesis itself and the subject matter.

A typical <i>viva</i> lasts for approximately 3 hours, though there is no formal time limit. Involved in the <i>viva</i> are two examiners and the candidate. Usually, one examiner is an academic from the candidate's own university department (but not one of the candidate's supervisors) and the other is an <a href=\"/wiki/External_examiner\" title=\"External examiner\">external examiner</a> from a different university. Increasingly, the examination may involve a third academic, the 'chair'; this person, from the candidate's institution, acts as an impartial observer with oversight of the examination process to ensure that the examination is fair.
