Many, or perhaps most, law schools in the United States grade on a curve. The process generally works within each class, where the instructor grades each exam, and then ranks the exams against each other, adding to and subtracting from the initial grades so that the overall grade distribution matches the school's specified curve (usually a bell curve).  "The curve" is the permitted range of each letter grade that can be awarded, for example, 0-3% A+, 3-7% A, etc.  Curves vary between different law schools, as do the rules for when the curve is mandatory versus suggestive.  It is common for the curve to be mandatory for first year ("1L") courses, and for classes above a certain size. Grading on a curve contributes to the notoriously competitive atmosphere within law schools. "The main source of this competition is the mandatory curve you will likely encounter once you enter law school. The curve affects the class rank, affects the chances of making law review, affects the chances of scoring that big job/externship."  Some law schools set their curve lower to retain scholarship funding; others set their curve higher to make their students more competitive in the job market. The following list shows where law schools set the 50% mark for an individual class subject to the curve.  Because not all classes are curved and because professors still have discretion within the curve's ranges, where a law school sets its curve is not necessarily revealing of that school's average student GPA (whether after 1L or upon graduation). <http://law.lmunet.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Student-Handbook-2016-2017-8-25-16.pdf> The following law schools have adopted a grading system which does not allow for the calculation of a comparable median GPA on a 4.0 scale, if any GPA is recorded at all:
