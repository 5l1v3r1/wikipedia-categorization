KEduca is GPL (version 2), (free software license) educational software included with the KDE desktop environment. It includes a module for constructing and saving new tests, and a module for loading and running the tests. Images can be included in questions, questions can have multiple answers with different scores, and questions can have a time limit. At the moment, no finished tests are included when you download it. KEduca was abandoned for KDE 4.0 due to lack of maintainer. There was a new start of KEduca in playground/edu but it has been abandoned again.
