Red Pitaya is an open-source hardware project intended to be alternative for many expensive laboratory measurement and control instruments. The core selling point is inclusion of 2x 125MS/s RF input and 2x 125MS/s RF outputs, with 50 MHz analogue bandwidth and 14 bit analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters. The software includes oscilloscope, spectrum analyzer, signal generator, LCR meter (the LCR add on costs an additional 400 euros), and 50 MHz 2x2 MIMO PID controller. It can be re-programmed to become other devices, as all the IO ports are connected to a common field-programmable gate array (FPGA). There are also auxiliary ADC (250kS/s) and digital IO.   It has three USB 2.0 ports, Wifi, Ethernet connector. Internally, it uses Linux as operating system. The mass storage device for the operating system is a micro-SD card. Due to the wide bandwidth of the ADC and DAC, the Red Pitaya can be used as a software defined radio receiver and transmitter and in other radio frequency applications.  HAMLAB, a fully featured SDR HF tranceiver with an output power of 10 W based on the Red Pitaya board is expected to be released in the amateur radio market in October 2016.  Although the software (including HDL source code) for this project is made freely available, the device is not a fully Open Source Hardware project, because the device's electrical schematics are not made openly available.
