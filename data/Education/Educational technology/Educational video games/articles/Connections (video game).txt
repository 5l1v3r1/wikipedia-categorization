Connections is a 1995 educational adventure video game. Based on the show Connections on The Learning Channel, the game revolves around a plot of the player aiming to fix a computer program, by finding a series of connections that glue the world together. Players progress through a series of graphic screens, and FMV video to find a series of connections. Items can be manipulated using hotspots. The game is narrated by James Burke.  Players can toggle a hints system, adjust volume, save the game, and choose their gender (although the latter option doesn't have any tangible difference).  Lisa Karen Savignano of Allgame wrote that the game was "exceptional" but that it had the potential to leave players endlessly frustrated.  GameZone's Craig Majaski thought the game would appeal to players who had enjoyed Myst or Return to Zork.  Meanwhile, The AV Club contributor Brian Clair said the game succeeded as a learning tool.  MacWorld's George and Ben Beekman thoguht the game was well below the industry standard for the genre.  Entertainment Weekly thoguht the game was a missed opportunity; instead of being interesting and unique it was merely "Myst with a twist".  The November 1996 edition of Computer Gaming World deemed the video game the #13 Top Sleeper Of All Time.
