 Volcanoes: Life on the Edge is a 1996 interactive CD-ROM published by Corbis.  It recounts the adventure of photojournalist Roger Russmeyer, who spent a series of months chasing volcanoes.  Discover Magazine deemed it a satisfying title about Earth science.  Technology Review deemed the title both the most conventional and arresting of Corbis' output.  Newsweek described the project as "well-wrought".  The Washington Post deemed it a first-rate CD-ROM documentary.  The Sydney Morning Herald disliked the " humdrum photo-essays about low-key eruptions".  After releasing A Passion for Art: Renoir, Cezanne, Matisse, and Dr. Barnes; Critical Mass: America's Race to Build the Atomic Bomb; and Volcanoes: Life on the Edge, Corbis gained a reputation for high quality work.  MacUser praised the well-organised interface  while Popular Science enjoyed the "stunning" photographs.  MacWorld gave the game 7.2/10.
