Word Attack! is a 1984 educational video game by Davidson & Associates. An updated version was released entitled Word Attack! Plus. The game found similar success to the Davidson titles Spell It and Reading and Me. The game consists of a series of language-based "drill-and-practice" minigames and exercises. In one, the player uses the arrow keys to fire at correct answer "targets". The nine programs are aimed at grades 4-12. By October 13, 1984, the game had sustained an 11-week streak on the Billboard Charts for Top Educational Computer Software.  It re-entered the charts on November 3, 1984 at #9,  and again on November 24, 1984 at #7.  By June 15, 1985, the game had stayed on the list for a total of 44 weeks, and was currently at #8.  The Computer in Reading and Language Arts criticised the mechanic of shooting the correct multiple choice answers, deeming the graphics to be out of place in an educational title.  InfoWorld deemed it well-organised and flexible, adding that it is an effective teaching tool.
