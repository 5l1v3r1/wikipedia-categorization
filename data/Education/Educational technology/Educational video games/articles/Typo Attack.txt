Typo Attack is a game for the Atari 8-bit computers programmed by David Buehler and published by the Atari Program Exchange in 1982.  Buehler was seventeen when the game won the USD$25,000 Atari Star Award for best APX program of 1982.  Typo Attack is designed to improve the user's typing skill. The game takes place on a single screen, divided up into multiple columns. At the bottom of each column is a letter or punctuation symbol and various enemies appear randomly at the top of the columns. Players must press the corresponding letter in a column in order to make the letter fire at the advancing enemies. If an enemy reaches the bottom of the screen they will remove part of the shield around the letter, and if it is eaten away completely the player will lose a life. Depending on the level, the letters assigned to each column will change at irregular intervals. In 1984, Atari converted Typo Attack to a cartridge (RX8057). A version was planned for the unreleased Atari CX-3000 Graduate, an add-on which turned the 2600 into a home computer.
