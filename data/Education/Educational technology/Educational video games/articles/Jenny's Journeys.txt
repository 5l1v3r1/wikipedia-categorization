 Jenny's Journeys is a single-player educational video game by Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium (MECC) which was released on the Apple II in 1984. The game is intended for users age 10 and up. In the game, players use a map and a compass to navigate from Jenny's car to her destination. This game was part of a group of video game titles with which MECC entered the "home software market" in the mid-1980s.  The purpose of Jenny's Journeys is to provide a real-world context for children to apply their map-reading skills.  In InCider, it is explained that this type of "role-play simulation" video game specializes in teaching kids how to follow instructions.   The main character is a woman named Aunt Jenny. She needs help on a trip to Lake City.  Players control a car and direct where the car will travel to next, allowing them to reach the destination successfully. The game has three levels of difficulty.
