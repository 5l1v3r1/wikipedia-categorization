Pirates: Captain's Quest is a 1997 educational adventure video game. In Spain the game was published by Zeta Multimedia.  The game allows the player to take control of the pirate Blackbeard the 1700s, who on his quest to capture Christopher Columbus' ship Santa Maria will allow the player to experience the pirating lifestyle with activities such as sword fighting, navigation, island conquering, and digging for buried treasure. Primarily an adventure game (due to requiring players to hunt for items and gather knowledge from characters to complete puzzles), the title contains 47 levels. It also contains minigames in other genres. Andy Backer of Computer Games Magazine positively compared it to Microprose's similarly-themed title Pirates Gold.  J.P. Faber of U.S. Kids deemed it "terrifically fun" due to creating a historically authentic atmosphere.  Daily Record thought thegame would keep kids entertained for hours, while educating them in the process.
