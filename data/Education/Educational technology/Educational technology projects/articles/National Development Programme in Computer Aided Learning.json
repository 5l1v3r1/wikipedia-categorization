It required joint funding from the host establishment and stipulated effective evaluation and monitoring processes but allowed a significant degree of autonomy to the projects.  The approach of the central team was active and interventionist, working alongside potential projects in their early stages to help develop their design and approach. They also focussed on good project management requiring four monthly accounting periods and carefully controlling expenditure.<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Governance\">Governance</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=National_Development_Programme_in_Computer_Aided_Learning&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Governance\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>CET was asked to provide administrative services to the new programme, and the programme's central staff were CET employees but executive control was with a committee made up of civil servants from seven government departments plus a group of co-opted advisers. This Programme Committee was chaired by the DES.  The Programme Committee was more than just a rubber stamping committee, it held the final say on proposals from the Programme Director and involved itself in project evaluation, setting up sub-committees of three or so of its members to look in detail at a particular proposal or project. Although each of the thirty projects had its own steering committee national linkage was maintained through a member of the national Programme Committee sitting on each project  steering committee.<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Setting_Up\">Setting Up</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=National_Development_Programme_in_Computer_Aided_Learning&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Setting Up\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>From January 1973 to early summer 1973, there was a phase of exploration and consultation and from the summer of 1973 to the end of the year, there was the setting up of the Programme's management structure and of the first generation of major projects, notably in the university sector. Richard Hooper was supported by two assistant directors, Mrs Gillian Frewin (from ICL) and Roger Miles (from the Army School of Instructional Technology). They were supported by two other executive posts and three secretaries.\nThe programme formulated two main aims over its lifetime (Hooper, 1975, p17):\n</p>\n<ol><li>to develop and secure the assimilation of computer assisted and computer managed learning on a regular institutional basis at reasonable cost</li>\n<li>to make recommendations to appropriate agencies in the public and private sector (including Government) concerning possible future levels and types of investment in computer assisted and computer managed learning in education and training.</li></ol>\n<p>Two evaluations were set up, one to consider the educational benefits and one to consider the financial aspects.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Breadth_of_Projects\">Breadth of Projects</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=National_Development_Programme_in_Computer_Aided_Learning&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Breadth of Projects\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>This first government funded programme to look at the use of computers focused on their use for learning other subjects rather than about computers or programming them. It supported some 35 projects, seven in schools, a number in higher education but the majority were based on the armed services\u2019 growing interest in developing more automated and managed approaches to training.  The hardware was limited; the computers were large expensive cabinets of complicated electronics accessed mainly by paper tape with Teletype printouts but already the focus was more on the way technology could be used to improve teaching and learning than as a subject in its own right.  This dichotomy continues throughout this history and different policies struggled with, and often confused this difference.\nNDPCAL funded a wide range of different projects - of different types, covering a range of subjects and age ranges sectors. Some of these such as Chelsea College's Computers in the Undergraduate Science Curriculum developed into the Computers in the Curriculum Project and Hertfordshire's Computer Managed Mathematics helped the Advisory Unit for Computer Based Education (AUCBE) at Hatfield develop.\n</p><p>It classified projects into different stages<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>\nStage 1 - Design and Feasibility  - a project that shows that a particular application of CAL or CML is feasible by developing and piloting applications.\nStage 2 - Development and Transferability - the creation of a working system for increasing numbers of students across a number of institutions.\nStage 3 - Model Operation - a fully operational project able to act as a model for others.\nStage 4 - Assimilation and Dissemination - national funding is being phased out and the institution has taken ownership with other new institutions taking it up.\n</p><p>About half the project funds were spent on projects in universities and polytechnics, about one-sixth of the project funds was spent on schools based projects and the rest on military and industrial training.
