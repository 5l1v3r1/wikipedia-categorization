Following a change of government in 1979, Keith Joseph as Education Secretary finally approved the proposal in 1980 and in March a four-year programme for schools, costing \u00a39 million. was announced by the Under Secretary of State at the Department of Education and Science, Mr Neil MacFarlane.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Central_team\">Central team</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Microelectronics_Education_Programme&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Central team\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The director of the programme was Richard Fothergill.
