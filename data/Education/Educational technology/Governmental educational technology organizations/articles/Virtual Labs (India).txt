Virtual Labs is a project initiated by the Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India, under the National Mission on Education through Information and Communication Technology.    The project aims to provide remote-access to Laboratories  in various disciplines of science and engineering for students at all levels from under-graduate to research.  It also intends to develop a complete Learning Management System where the students can avail the various tools for learning, including additional web-resources, video-lectures, animated demonstrations and self-evaluation. There is also a component wherein costly equipment and resources are shared, which are otherwise available to only a limited number of users due to constraints on time and geographical distances. Seven IIT's (Delhi, Bombay, Kanpur, Kharagpur, Madras, Roorkee and Guwahati), IIIT Hyderabad, 	Amrita University, Dayalbagh University, NIT Karnataka, and College of Engineering, Pune, are the institutions participating in the project. The Project intends to cover physical sciences, chemical science and various branches of engineering like electronics and communications, computer science and engineering, electrical engineering, 	mechanical engineering, chemical engineering, 	biotechnology engineering and civil engineering.
