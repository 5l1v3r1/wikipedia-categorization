Giant Campus, Inc. is a Seattle-based online education company, specializing in accessible and rigorous technology-focused courses for students, grades 9 through 12, as well as for members of the United States military and their families.  Giant Campus is geared towards developing original course content, mapping to both the Washington Career and Technical Education (WA CTE) and Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) frameworks in business innovation, computer science, and digital arts. According to the company's Web site, both its public and private school programs are designed "to inspire and prepare today’s youth with technology while engaging them in 21st century skills such as creativity, problem solving, communication and collaboration."  Giant Campus was founded in 1997, by president and CEO, Pete Findley.  The idea came when Findley was a business school student at the University of Washington, and he created a detailed business plan for a network of summer camps that would teach middle and high school kids new media skills—including multimedia and web design on college campuses. This project earned him first place in a statewide business plan competition, along with $15,000 in seed money to launch Giant Campus. Within five years, Giant Campus was running Cybercamps at more than 70 colleges, including programs in China, Hong Kong, Korea and Saudi Arabia.  In 2008, Findley was named Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year in the Pacific Northwest.  The company is now out of business.
