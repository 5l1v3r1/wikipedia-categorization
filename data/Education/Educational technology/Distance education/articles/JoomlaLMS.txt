 JoomlaLMS is a professional Learning Management System developed on the basis of Joomla Web content management system. The Learning Management System is PHP and MySQL based.  JoomlaLMS enables users to create native LMS courses or import SCORM 1.2  and SCORM 2004 courses either created using Rapid Elearning authoring tools or off the shelf acquired SCORM packages. JoomlaLMS was introduced by Elearningforce which initially provided Joomla components, extensions and modules developed by Belitsoft outsourcing software developer.  The idea for JoomlaLMS emerged due to the absence of Learning Management System for Joomla at that time. The first release was announced on 8 March 2007. In January 2009 Joomla officials removed Elearningforce extensions from their directory because of a change to the Joomla directory license policy  requiring extensions to use the GNU General Public License.
