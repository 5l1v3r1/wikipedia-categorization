Costello is an educational MUD — a text-based online role-playing game — designed for teaching English as a foreign or second language.   It is offered online as a free service.   Created in 1995,  it was innovative in its use of the MUD medium for EFL/ESL instruction,  and has received positive critical response.  Costello is intended to function both as an engaging game and a teaching environment,  following the reasoning that players will be more motivated to learn if their skill acquisition aids them in their game-play.  To avoid degrading the value of language skills acquired, the game's command parser avoids support for ungrammatical shorthand forms; where a typical MUD might allow a player to examine a hat with the syntax l hat, Costello requires look at the hat.  An integrated dictionary provides explication of unfamiliar terms.  The game may be played through a Web browser using a Java applet  or using a Java client distributed on a CD-ROM with the course textbook.   A non-networked standalone application version of Costello is also included on the CD-ROM. Costello's tagline is "Quest-Based Learning", reflecting its structuring of learning experiences through quests.   An earlier tagline was "English Through Imagination".  Costello runs on the MudOS game driver and a version of the Ain Soph Mudlib from Lost Souls, with customizations engineered by former Lost Souls developer Jason "Rand" Hitt and others.
