An autonomous university typically refers to a university that exercises independent control over its day-to-day operations and curriculum.  It is generally associated with universities or institutions and implies that the sponsoring state does not have control over academic matters of the school. Conversely, universities that are not autonomous generally have their academic programs and/or curriculum controlled and even dictated by the state's the Ministry of Education or government agency regulating higher education.
