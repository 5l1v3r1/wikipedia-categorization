Answer Underground was a social education company based in San Francisco, California. It developed an app for teachers and students to find information via group Q&A.  Answer Underground was founded in 2012  by Sallie Severns, a former executive at information company Answers.com.  Severns came up with the idea for a mobile collaborative elearning app after observing her son struggle to get homework help online.  Severns created the first prototype of the Answer Underground app in 2011 and it was released to open beta in May 2012.  Originally, the Answer Underground app was designed for mobile devices and was optimized for iOS. Users were authenticated through Facebook.  As of September 2013, the company had planned to release the app for the Android operating system.  The app focused on academic groups categorized by major subject areas. Members were able to post questions to academic groups. In 2013, a verification feature was added to identify experienced academics to differentiate credible responses.
