A flip chart is a stationery item consisting of a pad of large paper sheets. It is typically fixed to the upper edge of a whiteboard, typically supported on a tripod or four-legged easel. Such charts are commonly used for presentations. Although most commonly supported on a tripod, flip charts come in various forms. Some of these are: Text is usually hand written with marker pens and may include figures or charts. A sheet can be flipped over by the presenter to continue to a new page. Some flip charts may have a reduced version of the page that faces the audience printed on the back of the preceding page, making it possible for the presenter to see the same thing the audience is seeing. Others have teaching notes printed on the back. Flip charts are used in many different settings such as: A variety of paper sizes are used from the floor standing through to the smaller table-top versions, subject to the country's adopted paper sizes.

Flip charts have being in use from the 1900s, the earliest recorded use of a flip chart is a photo from 1912 of John Henry Patterson (1844-1922), NCRâ€™s CEO while addressing the 100 Point Club standing next to a pair of flip charts on casters.  The flipchart we know (on a small whiteboard) was invented by Peter Kent in the 1970s. Peter Kent was the founder and CEO of the visual communications group Nobo plc, and it is believed that they were the first company to put the large pieces of paper over whiteboards, rather than over other materials.

The disability action group "Armless" has stated that this is a significant step forward for disabilities groups to have conferences like people without disabilities. Also available are flipchart stands which are self heightening.
