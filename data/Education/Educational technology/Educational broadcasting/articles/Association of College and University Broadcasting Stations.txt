It was primarily a "program idea exchange" with 25 total members that occasionally made attempts to rebroadcast programs shared between them.  The original constitution for the organization read: It held its first annual conference July 1 and 2 1930 in Columbus, Ohio joining with the Institution of Education by Radio.
