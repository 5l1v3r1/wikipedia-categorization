Docebo is a software as a service platform for e-learning, also known as a learning management system.      Established in 2005, Docebo (Latin for "I will teach") offers a learning portal for companies and their employees, partners and customers.  Docebo is compatible with SCORM 1.2 and 2004 as well as Tin Can.  Developed by Docebo Srl, the program was originally released under a GPL V. 2.0 license with no licensing costs. The program now operates as a cloud-hosted software as a service platform as well as being third-party compatible. It currently runs version 7.0.  The company using the platform loads a course, creates a username and password for employees, and tracks the progress of its users.  Docebo is available in more than 32 languages.  While the primary users of Docebo are midsized companies, it is also assessable for large companies and SMEs.    In June 2016, Docebo was named by PCMag as "the best online learning platform for business on the market."  Docebo was founded in 2005 by Claudio Erba, who continues to lead the company as CEO.   Erba had previously been working at the University of Florence as a computer consultant when a customer asked for a storage solution for teaching material.  The storage solution evolved into what is now Docebo.  In 2012, Docebo received its first round of funding from Italian venture capital firm Principia SGR.   Later that same year, Docebo opened an office in Athens, Georgia.   Docebo's second venture-backed financing round came from Canadian firm Klass Capital in 2016, funding its continued North American expansion with the opening of an office in Toronto, Ontario.
