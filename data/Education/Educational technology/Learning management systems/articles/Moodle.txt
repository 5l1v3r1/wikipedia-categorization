Moodle is a free and open-source learning management system (LMS) written in PHP and distributed under the GNU General Public License.   Developed on pedagogical principles,   Moodle is used for blended learning, distance education, flipped classroom and other e-learning projects in schools, universities, workplaces and other sectors.     With customizable management features, it is used to create private websites with online courses for educators and trainers to achieve learning goals.   Moodle (acronym for modular object-oriented dynamic learning environment) allows for extending and tailoring learning environments using community sourced plugins.  Moodle was originally developed by Martin Dougiamas to help educators create online courses with a focus on interaction and collaborative construction of content, and it is in continual evolution. The first version of Moodle was released on 20 August 2002.  Nowadays the Moodle Project is led and coordinated by Moodle HQ, an Australian company of 50 developers which is financially supported by a network of eighty-four Moodle Partner service companies worldwide. Moodle's development has also been assisted by the work of open-source programmers.  Moodle as a learning platform can enhance existing learning environments.  As an E-learning tool, Moodle has a wide range of standard and innovative features  such as calendar and Gradebook.  Moodle is a leading virtual learning environment    and can be used in many types of environments such as education, training and development  and in business settings.   Plugins are a flexible tool set, allowing Moodle users to extend the features of the site. There are hundreds of plugins for Moodle, extending the features of Moodle's core functionality.  Each plugin is maintained in the Moodle plugins directory. As of June 2017, there are 1,342 plugins available for Moodle with over 405,200 recent downloads.  Graphical themes for Moodle can be installed to change the look and functionality of a Moodle site or of an individual course. Many Moodle themes, based on responsive web design, allow Moodle to be used on mobile devices. Also, a Moodle mobile app is available in Google Play, App Store (iOS), and the Windows Phone Store. Moodle has adopted the following e-learning standards: Users can download and install Moodle on a Web server, such as Apache HTTP Server, and a number of database management systems, such as PostgreSQL, are supported. Pre-built combinations of Moodle with a Web server and database are available for Microsoft Windows and Macintosh. Other automated installation approaches exist, such as installing  a Debian package, deploying a ready-to-use TurnKey Moodle appliance, using the Bitnami installer, or using a "one-click install" service such as Installatron. Certified Moodle Partners provide other Moodle services, including hosting, training, customization and content development.  This network of providers support development of the Moodle project through royalties.   Moodle runs without modification on Unix, Linux, FreeBSD, Windows, OS X, NetWare and any other systems that support PHP and a database, including webhost providers. Moodle also has import features for use with other specific systems, such as importing quizzes or entire courses from Blackboard or WebCT. As of  FebruaryÂ 2010[update], Moodle will not import Blackboard courses, apparently due to changes in php code-releases.  In March 2012 Blackboard acquired two companies based on Moodle's software including Baltimore-based Moodlerooms Inc. and NetSpot of Adelaide, Australia.  In August 2015, Blackboard acquired Colombia-based Nivel7, possibly the largest Moodle services provider in Latin America.  The Red Hat site, Opensource.com, reports that Moodle will always be an open source project, with clear delineation between Blackboard and Moodle.  For many schools, colleges and universities, SIMS integration is key to ensure a seamless data flow from the Management Information System through to the Learning Platform and back again. Many Learning Platforms do not enable write-back functionality, however this is often a key requirement from schools needing to write data onto their MIS and back again. Martin Dougiamas, who has graduate degrees in computer science and education, wrote the first version of Moodle. Dougiamas started a Ph.D. to examine "the use of open source software to support a social constructionist epistemology of teaching and learning within Internet-based communities of reflective inquiry." Although how exactly social constructionism makes Moodle different from other eLearning platforms is difficult to show, it has been cited as an important factor by Moodle adopters.   Other Moodle adopters, such as the Open University in the UK, have pointed out that Learning Management Systems can equally be seen as "relatively pedagogy-neutral".  The stated philosophy of Moodle includes a constructivist and social constructionist approach to education, emphasizing that learners (and not just teachers) can contribute to the educational experience.  Using these pedagogical principles, Moodle provides an environment for learning communities.  The acronym Moodle stands for modular object-oriented dynamic learning environment. (In the early years the "m" stood for "Martin's", named after Martin Dougiamas, the original developer). As well as being an acronym, the name was chosen because of the dictionary definition of Moodle  and to correspond to an available domain name.  Moodle has continued to evolve since 1999 (since 2001 with the current architecture). It has been translated into over 100 different languages and is accessible in many countries worldwide.  Institutions can add as many Moodle servers as needed without having to pay license fees. The Open University of the UK currently uses a Moodle installation for their 200,000 users  while the UK government uses a Moodle installation for their Civil Service Learning platform serving half a million employees.  (LTS) See official release page A MoodleMoot is a conference for Moodle community members, held to learn about Moodle, share experiences of the learning platform, discuss research in related educational technologies and contribute ideas to future Moodle development.  Held around the world, MoodleMoots are organised by universities or other large organisations using Moodle, Moodle Partners, Moodle associations or Moodle HQ. In the higher education market in the United States, Moodle was for a time the second largest provider with 23% market share in 2013 (following Blackboard (41%), Desire2Learn (11%), and Instructure).  However, by 2017 Moodle had dropped to the third largest provider, due in part to increased adoption of Instructure's Canvas platform.  In March 2016 Blackboard became an official Moodle partner.
