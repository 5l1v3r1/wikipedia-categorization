 Democrasoft, Inc., formerly Burst.com, is a public software company located in Santa Rosa, California. In 2010, the company launced Collaborize, an online communications tool, at the Spring DEMO Conference. That same year, the company changed its name to Democrasoft.  The company later released Collaborize Classroom, an online learning platform that included the Collaborize Classroom Topic Library which featured subject based lessons for teachers.  In August 2012, Democrasoft released the WeJit, a tool for on-line collaboration. In March 2005 the company, then named Burst.com, received $60 million as settlement in its suit against Microsoft over unauthorized use of its streaming media technology.   In January 2006, Apple Computer filed an action for a Declaratory Judgement seeking to have Burst's patents declared invalid. In April 2006, Burst.com counterclaimed against Apple Computer with regard to Apple's potential infringement of Burst.com's patents on streaming video and time-shifting of video. A "Markman" Claim Construction Memorandum and Order favorable to Burst was issued May 8, 2007.  In early November, the court invalidated 14 of Burst's claims, leaving 22 remaining.  On November 21, 2007, Apple Computer announced that it had called a truce in the legal feud between itself and Burst.com by agreeing to pay a $10 million lump sum in exchange for protection from current and future lawsuits.  RealNetworks sued Burst.com on January 3, 2008. The case was settled in May 2008 with RealNetworks agreeing to pay Burst a one-time payment of $533,500.00 cash in exchange for a license to a subset of the Burst patents.
