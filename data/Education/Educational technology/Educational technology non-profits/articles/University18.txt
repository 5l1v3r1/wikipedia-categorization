U18 is a large scale e-education venture based out of India. University18  works with Indian Universities in a public–private partnership, developing and delivering Accredited Degree and Diploma Programs to the Indian Learner around the Nation. U18 has a global footprint, with students spread across the world, and exam centers in Africa, Singapore, Malaysia, Dubai and the United Kingdom. University18's Programs are all structured around a web based e-education platform, one that has both asynchronous and synchronous components - the Learning Management System, and a Virtual Classroom System. Regular online sessions, with Professors from various Institutions around the Nation, act to bridge the gap between full time classroom learning and  Distance Learning.  The fact that U18 uses professors drawn from different Institutions give their programs some flexibility and flavor. The U18 premise is that classroom interaction, as well as the mentoring a classroom lecture (online) can provide, aid both the effort an adult learner makes and the challenges he/she faces by re-entering the formal education system after a break. The Re.Vica Project of the European Commission, describes U18 thus - “University18, a nonprofit private-sector initiative (currently in partnership with the Karnataka State Open University), represents a significant development in the region which may well have great impact in the near future“.  U18 is a nominee for the eIndia 2010 Awards,  to be given out in August, at the eIndia 2010 convention at Hyderabad. University18 currently has tie ups with Assam Don Bosco University and the University of Mysore
