Internet-in-a-Box is a low-cost digital library, consisting of a wireless access point with storage, which users nearby can connect to.  Its realization in hardware and software has changed since 2012, as miniaturization of storage space and electronics progressed.  As of 2017, its hardware consists of a Raspberry Pi with a replaceable storage card.  In 2016, Columbia University's Masters in Public Administration in Development Practice (MPA-DP) explored using these boxes in Dominican Republic for three months.  The digital library is composed of multiple modules. Examples of modules include Wikipedia in a specific language, Wikipedia's Medical Encyclopedia, Khan Academy lite, and OpenStreetMap.   The concept grew out of One Laptop per Child's school server project.  2017 version of IIAB with medical content An older version of offline Wikimedia content and a WiFi transmitter.
