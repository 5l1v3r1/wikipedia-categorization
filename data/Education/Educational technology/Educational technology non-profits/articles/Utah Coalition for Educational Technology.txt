The Utah Coalition for Educational Technology (UCET) is a 501(c)3 Utah not-for-profit, volunteer-service organization comprising educators and others interested in promoting technology-enhanced learning and teaching for all teachers and students. Its annual membership exceeds a thousand persons. UCET is a full affiliate of the International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE). UCET is associated with and works closely with the Utah Education Network and the Utah State Office of Education. One of the annual highlights of UCET action is its annual conference, attended by several hundred enthusiastic registrants, including educators, prospective educators and other interested people from all parts of Utah, the United States, and other nations. Recent keynote speakers include David Pogue, David Warlick, Marc Prensky, Bernajean Porter, Ann Collier, Bernie Dodge and Steve Wozniak, among other stellar technology-wielding educators. The UCET website also includes archives of past conference materials and plans for upcoming conferences.
