SuperProfs is an education technology startup founded in 2010 and based out of Bengaluru.   It provides exam preparation classes.    SuperProfs was founded by Piyush Agrawal, a Stanford University PhD dropout, in 2010 to provide competitive exam preparation for Indian students.   Piyush was named one of Indiaâ€™s top innovators under 35 in the EmTech Awards in 2016.  He has also been featured in the Young Turks feature program of CNBC TV18.  SuperProfs success has in part been the result of a mobile app that works at slower speeds of Internet connection by allowing students to download lectures.   The download option bridges a technological gap in India.  SuperProfs has raised three million dollars from venture capital firms Kalaari Capital and IDG Ventures India in 2014.
