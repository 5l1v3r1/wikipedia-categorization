Securly provides cloud-based web filtering for schools and allows information technology (IT) administrators and parents to manage screen time for devices. The company is a venture-backed  K-12 service provider based in Silicon Valley and was founded in 2012 by former McAfee network engineers Vinay Mahadlk  and Bharath Madhusudan.  Securly is said to use emotional learning, natural language processing and other machine learning techniques, to study the differences between, when a kid is involved in acceptable research activities, versus engaging oneself in harmful and unacceptable behavior.  Web filters are commonly used for the purpose of preventing individuals from accessing websites. Securly, which serves only K-12 schools, employs a philosophy of using web filtering as a means of providing schools with data on how students are using their 1:1 devices in a positive manner.  In October 2014, Securly was one of the first K-12 Service Providers to sign the Student Privacy Pledge co-created by the Future of Privacy Forum and the Software & Information Industry Association. On January 12, 2015, Securly and 74 other companies, including Apple and Microsoft, were given recognition by President Barack Obama and the White House for their efforts to safeguard student data and privacy.  In February 2015, Securly was reviewed by the popular educator website The Ed Tech Roundup and received a 5-star rating for its school product.
