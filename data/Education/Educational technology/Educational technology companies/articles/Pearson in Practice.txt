Pearson in Practice is a group of companies acquired by Pearson that were previously part of the Melorio group; each part of the group became Pearson in Practice.  Since buying the group Pearson's have expanded the portfolio to increase the range of apprenticeships it can offer from Construction, IT, PR through to Legal. Pearson in Practice Technology, formerly Zenos IT Academy, is only part of Pearson in Practice and is an institute offering government-funded apprenticeships for learners aged 16 to 24, and paid learning for people outside those boundaries. It focuses on giving its candidates the ability to sit Microsoft exams after an intense learning program that lasts for 12 months.  Pearson announced plans to exit Pearson in Practice on 7 January 2013, although learners already signed up will be supported until the end of their courses.  In February 2013 it was transferred to Vision Workforce Skills.   Learners explore the full boundaries of computing, by looking at advanced server technology, internet knowledge, group policies and various other sections related to networks and computers.  Throughout the year  apprentices now spend time split between employer (40 weeks) and training center (12 weeks), whilst at the training center they complete a level three apprenticeship and also sit vendor exams. In a recent Ofsted report, the graduation rate for the Zenos organization is higher than the average college percentages, and lies at 90%.  Of the classes of passing students, there are on average about 60% that find work within the first 2 months of graduation, 40% that either go into work experience, or later employment.  The name former name Zenos was derived from the term Zen with the addition of the last two letters referencing to the company slogan of "The Zen of Success".
