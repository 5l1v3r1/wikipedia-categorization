The interviewer records his or her questions over video and sends them over to candidates with an established deadline.  After viewing each question, an interviewee has an allotted amount of time to think over the query, after which the webcam turns on and another specified time frame is given for a response. After applicants have responded the reviewers can log-in to see, rank, share, and compare the results.   In July 2017, Kira introduced the ability to upload documents like resumes and written essays.   In October 2012, Kira Talent closed a seed capital investment round led by Relay Ventures  and supported by 18 investors, including entrepreneur Tony Lacavera,    business strategist Roger Martin  and financir David Shaw.
