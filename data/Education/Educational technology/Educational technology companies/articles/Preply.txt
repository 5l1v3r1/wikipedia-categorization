Preply is an online educational technology platform which pairs students with private tutors, either locally in-person or remotely via Skype. It features a ranking algorithm which uses machine learning for classification and recommendation of tutors.  At IDCEE (Internet Technologies & Innovations) 2012, Preply was chosen as one of the most promising startup companies in Ukraine.  Afterwards, the startup was picked up by Eastlabs, and following an initial investment of $175,000 from Vostok Ventures as well as business angels Semyon Dukach and Torben Majgaard,  its site, preply.com, was launched in November 2012.  Co-founded by Serge Lukianov, Dmytro Voloshyn, and Kirill Bigai – who serves as its current CEO  – the company initially entered the Ukrainian, Russian, Belarussian and Kazakhstani markets, before expanding to the Polish market  and receiving a $120,000 TechStars Berlin investment.  At the beginning of 2016, the company entered the Brazilian market.  After closing a $1.3 million seed round in June 2016, Preply has announced intentions of expanding its services to three more markets: UK, Germany, and Spain.  A February 2017 EuropaWire article stated that Preply had 47,000 registered tutors, offering help in as many as 40 different subjects, 27 of which were languages courses.  As of July 2017, as per the company's statistics, almost 100,000 students have successfully found a tutor using the platform.  It is estimated that tutors give about 30,000 hours of lessons per month at a price varying anywhere between $2 and $100.
