PrepClass is a Nigerian Edu-tech company.    PrepClass was founded on May 1, 2013 in Lagos, Nigeria by two friends, namely Chukwuwezam Obanor and Olumide Ogunlana both graduates of the University of Lagos.  The idea was developed when the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) in Nigeria announced the birth of computer-based tests. The two friends  saw an avenue to help students and learners prepare for tests and examinations online and thus, created a ‘test prep’ platform to help change, shape and improve the educational system in the country. This attempt later developed  and led the creation of PrepClass  In January 2018, an App called Prep-test was developed by the PrepClass team. It provides tutors with a platform where they are able to create and upload contents as text, image, audio-visuals (videos).  In February 2014, the co-founders of Prepclass entered and won their first competition which was the Techcabal Battlefield. The company received a $20,000 cash prize.   The innovation of the firm was also able to attract another $12,500 of equity free funding for emerging as the overall grand prize winner from Africa in the Indian-Africa competition which held later in 2014.  In 2015, PrepClass was selected for the GSMA Ecosystem Accelerator Innovation Fund where they were awarded $322,000 grant.  With this grant, the edu-tech company will be moving to the next phase in its business evolution.   PrepClass offers customized learning program for students and professionals.
