QuobjectÂ® Designer is a freeware computer software running on MS Windows. It enables easy creation of question object files (quox). Exam questions in the quox format can easily be shared among teachers and quickly combined for rapid creation of worksheets, exams and online quizzes within Quobject Explorer. The question object file contains all information for an exam question i.e. question text, pictures, math formulas, number of marks, number of dotted lines for student answer (used when creating a paper version of quiz). The question object file contains also the answer to the question, which is used to create a separate answer sheet when creating a paper version of the quiz/exam.  Once the quox file of a question is written the question can easily be configured with other questions to create a written paper containing this question. This configuration occurs by drag and drop within Quobject Explorer. Worksheets created within Quobject Explorer can be exported to a "quiz" file which is an ordered zip package of quox files.
