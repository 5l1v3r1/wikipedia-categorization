TinkerPlots is exploratory data analysis and modeling software designed for use by students in grades 4 through university.  It was designed by Clifford Konold and Craig Miller at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and is currently published by the Learn Troop.   It runs on Windows XP or later and Mac OS 10.4 or later.  The program allows users to enter their own data, to import them from other applications or the Web, or to generate them using a sampling engine.  The program also comes with 50 multivariate data sets. Using TinkerPlots, students can make a large variety of graphs, including those specified for middle school in Common Core State Standards for Mathematics But rather than making these graphs directly using commands, students construct them by progressively organizing cases using basic operations including “stack,” “order,” and “separate.”  Responding to these operations, case icons animate into different screen positions.  The interface was based on observations of people organizing “data cards” on a table to make graphs to answer specific questions   Innovations of TinkerPlots include using a superimposed color gradient  to detect covariation in two numeric attributes  and a “hat plot,”  a reformulated and generalized version of the box plot. The latest version is 2.3.4.   This version does not have substantively different features from versions 2.1 and 2.2, but has a number of bug fixes and enhancements to remain compatible with the latest versions of Windows and MacOS.
