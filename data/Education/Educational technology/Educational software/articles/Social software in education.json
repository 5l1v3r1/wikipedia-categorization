reality may be different.  Any significant or established piece of software is likely to be the result of a collaborative effort by software developers (<a href=\"#CITEREFBrooks1995\">Brooks 1995</a>), working together or building on someone's previous work. Figure 1 appears to show students working individually at their computers.\nAt face value, this use of software does not seem to be very social but the reality could be different, with students engaging in online chats, sending emails, posting in discussion forums with friends and acquaintances, near and far.  Even where only one person is using the computer, everyone around can be joining in and having fun, as in Figure 2.\n</p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"20\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><a href=\"/wiki/File:Students_working_on_class_assignment_in_computer_lab.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Students working on class assignment in computer lab.jpg\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Students_working_on_class_assignment_in_computer_lab.jpg/240px-Students_working_on_class_assignment_in_computer_lab.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Students_working_on_class_assignment_in_computer_lab.jpg/360px-Students_working_on_class_assignment_in_computer_lab.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Students_working_on_class_assignment_in_computer_lab.jpg/480px-Students_working_on_class_assignment_in_computer_lab.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"1280\" data-file-height=\"960\" /></a>\n</td>\n<td>\n</td>\n<td>\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Figure 1: Students working in computer lab\n</td>\n<td>\n</td>\n<td>Figure 2: Children congregating around a child using a computer\n</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Software on a single computer being used in a classroom can be seen as an activity in a social setting. The student using the computer may talk to the teacher and other students, asking for help, sharing information and reactions to their experiences of the software in use.\nA study of young children\u2019s use of a program for drawing and writing found that they were not only reading printed texts and writing on paper but also engaging in multimedia, computer-based composition (<a href=\"#CITEREFLabbo1996\">Labbo 1996</a>).  This effect has also been observed with students using a shared system.  An experiment with Group Decision Support Systems revealed university students\u2019 appreciation of and benefit from the information structuring and sharing features of the system (Alavi, 1994).\n</p><p>A more recent exploratory video study into young people's use of games consoles reveals that individual use takes places in a rich social context.\n</p><p>\u201c<i>Games intended to engage a single player were shown to incorporate cooperation with, and the contribution of, others.</i>\u201d (Schott &amp; Kambouri, 2006).\n</p><p>This study found examples where collaborative play was more effective for learning than explicit instruction.\n</p><p>Others believe that software can enable the engineering of social interaction. One approach to using software for learning aligns with a <a href=\"/wiki/Social_Software\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Social Software\">programmatic</a>, step by step approach to learning that fits with learning as instruction, knowledge as transmission (see Table 1). The claim is that learning and other social activities can be programmed just like a computer.  The \"Games, Action, and Social Software\" group at Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study in the Humanities and Social Sciences (NIAS):\n</p><p>\u201c<i>argue that the issue of constructing and verifying social procedures, which Professor Rohit Parikh suggestively calls social software, be pursued as systematically as computer software is constructed and analysed by computer scientists.</i> (see \"What is Social Software? ,\")\u201d (NIAS, 2006) <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.nias.knaw.nl/en/press_releases/rohit_parikh/\">[1]</a>.\n</p><p>This <a href=\"/wiki/Social_Software\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Social Software\">programmatic</a> approach is evident in variants of online course design.   others being described in the context of Web 2.0 technologies that view the trend towards great <a href=\"/wiki/Social_networking\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Social networking\">social networking</a> online as simply an evolution of <a href=\"/wiki/Elearning\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Elearning\">elearning</a> rather than a major paradigm shift. The utilisation of social software, however, is not simply a new way to teach content, it is method that shifts our relationship with knowledge to include a greater emphasis on peer-to-peer sharing of knowledge, towards more flexible sharing (favouring wikis and web sites over formal journals and copyright) and more ephemeral knowledge (the constantly updating world of blogs and RSS feeds (Mason and Rennie, 2008). Researchers have consequently explored a changing educational landscape where social networking (using a whole variety of new applications) is no longer the one-way transmission of knowledge, but a collaborative process of research and sharing that is no longer linear, not necessarily under the full control of the tutor, and places a higher value on the co-creation, sharing, and re-purposing of educational resources, and above all on increased <i>interaction</i> between the learning participants (Mason and Rennie, 2006).\n</p><p>The term <i>social software</i> (see later at <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://wiki.alt.ac.uk/index.php/Using_social_software_in_learning#Social_Software\">[2]</a>) came into popular use from 2003 after Clay Shirky\u2019s influential article on social software and groups (Shirky, 2003) <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.shirky.com/writings/group_politics.html\">[3]</a>.  It is fairly straightforward to trace the evolution of social software in parallel with the development of tele-communications and the Internet/WWW (Allen, 2006)<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/10/tracing_the_evo.html\">[4]</a>.  The spread of tele-communications networking in the late 1970s was a trigger that led to an increase in \u2018social\u2019 uses where users could interact remotely through networked software. Usenet, group chat, and MUDs all developed within the space of 18 months (Shirky, 2003)<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.shirky.com/writings/group_politics.html\">[5]</a>.\n</p><p>Text-based games were played on local networks, Arpanet and other networks that preceded the Internet as we know it now. Multi-User Dungeons (MUDs) are text-based games that allow players to adopt roles on a complex virtual environment that exists mainly in the players\u2019 imaginations. They rely on text-based communication and invocation of rules programmed into the MUD.  MOOs, introduced in the 1990s are MUDs that can be configured using their own built-in object-oriented language (Bartle, n.d.) <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.livinginternet.com/d/di_major.htm\">[6]</a>.   Though many links to MUDs and MOOs are now dead, you can find some useful information and examples at this site (Jobe, 2000)<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.education-world.com/a_tech/tech010.shtml\">[7]</a> .  There are links to some useful examples, such as this one where students collaborated online to learn and produce resources (\"Water Pollution in Brazil and California,\" 2002)<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.garlic.com/~lullah/brazilus/water.html\">[8]</a> . Computer users could get in touch with each other: talk, argue, play, get to know each other. In the 1980s, the possibilities for the use of <a href=\"/wiki/Computer-mediated_communication\" title=\"Computer-mediated communication\">computer-mediated communication</a> (CMC) in education became clear (Hiltz &amp; Wellman, 1997). The WELL, Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link, an early example of virtual community, started in 1985, forming a meaningful community for members, some of whom met face to face, and others who never met (Rheingold, 1994) (see links at <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://wiki.alt.ac.uk/index.php/On-line_communities\">[9]</a>). With the advent of the Internet in the 1990s, new opportunities opened up for learning.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Learning_Becoming_Social\">Learning Becoming Social</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Social_software_in_education&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Learning Becoming Social\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/Informal_learning\" title=\"Informal learning\">Informal learning</a> has always been social, but trends in education and technology have led to a growth in social learning, even in formal education. Formal institutions for learning, <a href=\"/wiki/Schools\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Schools\">schools</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Colleges\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Colleges\">colleges</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Universities\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Universities\">universities</a> have a fairly long history but limited to an elite.  Most of the population of Europe and the United States had no schooling whatsoever until the first half of the nineteenth century (Giddens, 1993), and education for all children has yet to be achieved in all countries.  Education statistics published in May 2008 show that 75 million children were out of school in 2006, down from 103 million in 1999 <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.uis.unesco.org/ev.php?ID=7194_201&amp;ID2=DO_TOPIC\">UNESCO, 2008</a>. Learning within the family setting, socialisation, is a large part of most children\u2019s learning experiences, it being where they first learn about roles, relationships and responsibilities within the family, the wider community and society, (Alexander &amp; Clyne, 1995).\nWe also learn about our culture through social groups and through work, by experience and social interaction, sometimes called <a href=\"/wiki/Enculturation\" title=\"Enculturation\">enculturation</a>.  Young children also learn through <a href=\"/wiki/Play_(activity)\" title=\"Play (activity)\">play</a>, often in a social setting with their friends. This is in contrast with formal learning in academic environments that focuses on learning from descriptions of the real world, rather than from direct experience of it.\n</p><p><i>\u201cLearning in naturalistic contexts is synergistic with the context; the learning outcome is an aspect of the situation, an aspect of the relation between learner, activity and environment, so it is learning about that world and how it works.\u201d</i> (Laurillard, 1993)\n</p><p>As education became a goal of industrial societies, in turn it became the object of study itself.  The twentieth century saw the development of a rich variety of <a href=\"/wiki/Learning_theory_(education)\" title=\"Learning theory (education)\">learning theories</a>  (many outlined in the useful <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tip.psychology.org/\">Theory into Practice database</a>). It is impossible to categorise these theories but we can identify three themes broadly based on how they interpret and theorise about learning and teaching (see Table 1), and link these to developments in learning technology. We do not suggest that these themes developed in any sequence but rather they are interconnecting strand of thought. Each of these themes has developed over time and enjoyed variable popularity at different times.  In practice, tutors may incorporate elements from any or all of these themes in designing and conducting learning activities with students.\n</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Instruction_.E2.80.93_teaching_and_learning_of_explicit_knowledge_and_skills\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Instruction_\u2013_teaching_and_learning_of_explicit_knowledge_and_skills\">Instruction \u2013 teaching and learning of explicit knowledge and skills</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Social_software_in_education&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Instruction \u2013 teaching and learning of explicit knowledge and skills\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>The first theme is that of instruction, where learning is seen as pre-planned, determined by a teacher or instructor.  Knowledge is understood as something that can be transmitted from teacher to student.  Techniques include programmed learning, tutorials, lectures, and drill-and-practice (Cronje, 2000)<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://itech1.coe.uga.edu/itforum/paper48/paper48.htm\">[10]</a>.  This approach is seen as traditional, founded on behavioural psychology, e.g. behaviourism \"Operant Conditioning  (B.F. Skinner)\" (Kearsley, 1994)  <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://tip.psychology.org/skinner.html\">[11]</a>.  Rather than being superseded by later approaches, we can see <i>instruction</i> as an ongoing theme, evident in elements of much of the current practice, even where a <i>social constructivist</i> approach is being adopted.  For example, a UK undergraduate will almost certainly receive some formal lectures, alongside more active learning activities such as simulations and group work.\n</p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"20\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<caption>Table 1 - Themes in Learning and Technology\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<th>Theme\n</th>\n<th>Understanding of knowledge\n</th>\n<th>Focus\n</th>\n<th>Use of learning technology\n</th>\n<th>Sources\n</th></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Instruction \u2013 teaching  of facts, learned by individuals\n</td>\n<td>Objective - facts that can be transmitted from teacher to student\n</td>\n<td>Individual\n</td>\n<td>Programmed instruction, Learning Packages, monolithic teacher-controlled Virtual Learning Environment\n</td>\n<td>(Cronje, 2000)<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://itech1.coe.uga.edu/itforum/paper48/paper48.htm\">[12]</a>, (Skinner, 1986)<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://tip.psychology.org/skinner.html\">[13]</a>\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Social Constructivism\u2013 learning constructed within social group\n</td>\n<td>Subjective \u2013 individual constructs knowledge within social setting\n</td>\n<td>Social\n</td>\n<td>Computer-mediated communication, social networking services, social software, group decision support services, groupware, communication features within VLEs\n</td>\n<td>Vygotsky and Social Cognition(2001)  <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.funderstanding.com/vygotsky.cfm\">[14]</a>, Vygotsky's Theory of Social Development(n.d.) <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.simplypsychology.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/vygotsky.html\">[15]</a>\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Critical pedagogy  \u2013 learning as empowerment\n</td>\n<td>Knowledge is seen as inseparable from the power relations that exist in its context\n</td>\n<td>Individuals and groups within society\n</td>\n<td>Free/Libre Open Source Software, Feral Learning, personal learning environments\n</td>\n<td>(Edwards, 2001). <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://opensource.mit.edu/papers/kasperedwards-ec.pdf\">[16]</a>, Smith, M.

Exponents regard truth as testable in action with observable outcomes, hence always open to criticism and revision (Dewey, 1991).\nConstructivism asserts that although humans possess some innate cognitive potentialities, human knowledge is largely constructed (Phillips, 1995). Early constructivist work, e.g. Piaget\u2019s emphasised the individual, but interest grew in social constructivism.  This is an approach, based on phenomenology, that places a greater emphasis on the importance of social interactions in affecting the individual's generation of knowledge or facts about the world.\n</p><p>Figure 3 - The Constructivist Shift, after (Goodyear et al., 2001)\n</p><p>Another challenge to theories of rational action was the emphasis on situated action, with plans being formulated pre or post-hoc but abandoned in the messy reality of embodied action.  Two examples of social constructivist approaches are situated cognition, (Brown, Collins, &amp; Duguid, 1989) and situated learning, (Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991).\n</p><p><i>\"Situated cognition theorists suggest that knowledge and the conditions under which is it used are inextricably linked. Social cognitivists indicate that learning is a goal-directed activity that is connected to the social contexts, including people, in which it occurs or is ultimately applied. Both views promote learning in realistically complex contexts that do not decontextualize knowledge and skills from the circumstances in which they are applied.\"</i> (Hannafin, 1997).\n</p><p>Vygotsky\u2019s work, from much earlier in the twentieth century, has been re-appraised in the new context of computer-mediated communication (CMC). Vygotsky\u2019s emphasis on language as a tool for mediation in the social process of education, and the agency of the teacher and more experienced peers in the educational development of the individual, assumed new significance in the use of CMC in education (Bacalarski, 1994) <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://psych.hanover.edu/vygotsky/bacalar.html\">[20]</a>. Like Dewey, Vygotsky viewed meaning and experience as primarily social.\n</p><p>Moore's transactional distance theory is characterised along three axes\n<i>\"There are three key variables to consider regarding transactional distance: structure, dialogue, and learner autonomy. Structure is determined by the actual design of the course, the organization of the instruction, and the use of various media of communications. There are also different forms of dialogue: two-way, real-time communication versus dialogue internalized within the student.

The first trend is the towards the social, often in formal group work or informal study groups or associations that may extend way beyond a class cohort. The social construction of knowledge relies heavily on dialogue, and this may be between students and possibly a teacher within a group.  Social software can give very effective support to, not only dialogue, but also non-verbal and non-direct forms of communication . The second is the rise in informal learning, where the potential for power shifts to occur and for learners to form their own groups and associations is very important.  This too can be supported by social software.  How social software supports these two themes for educational purposes has recently been reviewed by Mason and Rennie (2008).\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Definitions\">Definitions</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Social_software_in_education&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: Definitions\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Social_Presence\">Social Presence</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Social_software_in_education&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10\" title=\"Edit section: Social Presence\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Rourke, Anderson, Garrison &amp; Archer (1999) define <b>social presence</b> as the ability of learners to project themselves socially and affectively into an online community of inquiry.

[People communicating via electronic media] \"<i>perform social acts in action situations that are normatively regulated by, and already have meaning within the organisational context</i>\" (Ngwenyama &amp; Lee, 1997) <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.coba.usf.edu/departments/isds/faculty/abhatt/rm/Ngwenyama97-CST.pdf\">[29]</a>.\nAn example of this could the power relations that underpin a set of text messages between a group of young people where meaning could only be understood within that social context.

In its current manifestations, there are three key activities that social software supports: <i>conversational interaction</i> between individuals and groups; <i>social feedback</i> where groups rate the contributions of members; and <i>social networks</i> where the links between individuals and groups are made visible (S. Boyd, 2006)<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.stoweboyd.com/message/2006/10/are_you_ready_f.html\">[33]</a>.It also has the capacity for control and structure to emerge from user interaction rather than solely by design (Dron,2006). For example, in a VLE such as Blackboard, a group is determined and allocated by the instructor or teacher.  In contrast, in a social networking environment, such as elgg, individual users can make many groups and form networks of association by \"<a href=\"/wiki/Friending\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Friending\">friending</a>\".  Students told to engage in discussion on a forum visible to their teacher may set up a backchannel (on Instant messaging or mobile phone) to help them manage their 'viewed' discussion.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Social_Translucence\">Social Translucence</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Social_software_in_education&amp;action=edit&amp;section=13\" title=\"Edit section: Social Translucence\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Erickson and <a href=\"/wiki/Wendy_Kellogg\" title=\"Wendy Kellogg\">Kellogg</a> define socially translucent systems as ones that exhibit three properties - visibility, awareness, and accountability - in supporting social interaction. They make social information visible to help participants to understand what is happening; and to be held accountable for their own actions. They say \"In socially translucent systems we believe it will be easier for users to carry on coherent discussions; to observe and imitate others' actions; to engage in peer pressure; to create, notice, and conform to social conventions. We see social translucence as a fundamental requirement for supporting all types of communication and collaboration.\"  An implication is that participants need to be aware of all three properties and what they mean within the context for the interactions (Erickson &amp; Kellogg, 2002) <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.pliant.org/personal/Tom_Erickson/st_TOCHI.html\">[34]</a>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Web_2.0\">Web 2.0</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Social_software_in_education&amp;action=edit&amp;section=14\" title=\"Edit section: Web 2.0\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Social software predated Web 2.0 and the concept was being used interchangeably with <a href=\"/wiki/Social_computing\" title=\"Social computing\">social computing</a> before this Internet technology construct emerged.

Examples include:\n</p><p>1. <b>reviewing and recommender functions</b>, such as in the e-commerce site, Amazon\n</p><p>2. 'free' but commercial <b>social network services</b>, such as Facebook and Bebo through their basic functionality and add-on applications\n</p><p>3. <b>commercially licensed software</b>, such as commercial virtual learning environments, that contain elements of support for social interaction e.g. Blackboard, and specific packages such as First Class for communication and collaboration, and Elluminate for online 'live' classrooms\n</p><p>4. <b>open source software</b> packages that may be free-standing tools, such as forums, or virtual learning environments (also called learning management systems), the most notable of which is Moodle .  Open Source Development projects may have educational support communities or networks associated with them, for example Moodle and Eduspaces (that sprang from the elgg OSS community).\n</p><p>Educators will be looking for appropriate software that can support the three key activities from our definition of social software: conversational interaction between individuals and groups; social feedback where groups rate the contributions of members; and social networks where the links between individuals and groups are made visible.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Conversational_Interaction_between_Individuals_and_Groups\">Conversational Interaction between Individuals and Groups</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Social_software_in_education&amp;action=edit&amp;section=16\" title=\"Edit section: Conversational Interaction between Individuals and Groups\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Any virtual learning environment is likely to support conversational interaction through email and discussion forums, within class cohorts and other groups, defined by the institution. Students may use multiple channels  to support social and work-related communication, each occupying its niche, e.g. forums for class-wide discussion, private messaging for personal contact, and email for intra-team communication (Haythornthwaite, 2001.  However, support for social feedback and learner-led groupings like personal social networks is likely to be thin in widely used commercial VLEs, see examples here <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://francesbell.com/2008/03/08/wearing-my-students-shoes/\">[39]</a>.  Well-established VLEs were predicated on top-down control and organisation, and will need to make radical changes to their architectures to accommodate true social networking features. Blackboard has pursued a policy of adding to functionality by acquiring software that is then incorporated as 'building blocks' but the integration is often superficial. For example, the link to a person's name is more likely to pull up an email form, rather than to their 'linkable' profile and on to their blog, wikis, etc.  Blackboard has ProjectNG on the horizon <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.blackboard.com/projectNG/\">[40]</a>, and promises to incorporate Web 2.0 functionality and OSS content (but not the other way around).  One advantage of an institutional implementation of conversational tools (as a by-product of a VLE) is that student enrolment is managed, and the teacher can concentrate on structuring the activity for pedagogic purposes.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Social_feedback\">Social feedback</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Social_software_in_education&amp;action=edit&amp;section=17\" title=\"Edit section: Social feedback\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Social feedback may come in the form of conversational responses, from students and teachers who are effective communicators and facilitators.  Salmon's 5 Stage model puts facilitating, supporting and responding in the last two stages (Salmon, 2000)<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.atimod.com/e-moderating/5stage.shtml\">[41]</a>, implying that these are more advanced skills for students.\n</p><p>Emoticons may be used to express a wider range of responses, usually expressed by non-verbal communication: for example to soften negative statements, or to express enthusiastic approval or humour (Bell &amp; Zaitseva, 2005) <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.wwwords.co.uk/pdf/viewpdf.asp?j=elea&amp;vol=2&amp;issue=4&amp;year=2005&amp;article=4_Bell_ELEA_2_4_web&amp;id=146.87.255.19\">[42]</a>.  On the other hand, emoticons may be perceived as childish, or not appropriate in formal education. Emoticons are routinely available in chat rooms and forums in the public domain, but are not currently embedded in every VLE.  For example, Moodle has emoticons but they are not available in current versions of Blackboard.\n</p><p>Social feedback may also be given through the commenting on and rating of contributions, e.g. blog or discussion forum postings, or uploads to photo or video sharing sites.  In Moodle, a teacher can set up scales in Forums, Glossaries and Assignments for students and teachers to rate a student's activity <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://docs.moodle.org/en/Scales\">[43]</a>.\n</p><p>However, extrinsic rewards can be counter-productive, especially with complex activities, where too much emphasis on the outcome can de-motivate and reduce intrinsic satisfaction (Kohn, n.d.)<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/motivation.html\">[44]</a>.\n</p><p>Feedback on learning processes can be encouraged through reflective threads in discussion forums, or through the use of reflective journals (offered in Moodle as an activity, and through personal development planning software).  This is not particularly social, as journals are usually one to one between student and teacher.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Social_Networks\">Social Networks</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Social_software_in_education&amp;action=edit&amp;section=18\" title=\"Edit section: Social Networks\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Where social software exhibits 'social translucence', personal social networks may be visible <b>implicitly</b>.  For example, Moodle offers the chance for participants to see who is in their space or course, and who else is online at the same time, as this screen shot shows.\n</p><p>This knowledge of who is in their course and whether or not they are online may provoke multi-channel communications such as private messages, forum posts and emails that can strengthen participants' personal social networks.  Clicking on Frances Bell's name in the example above would allow logged in users to send her a private message, access her profile (where she may have provided links to other channels such as Skype), and check forum posts she has made.\n</p><p>Free commercial social networks such as Facebook allow individuals to make their personal networks visible <b>explicitly</b> by use of 'friending' and other relationship management features.\n</p><p>Facebook was started by Mark Zuckerberg and co-founders Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes when they were students at Harvard. University networks still use a valid email address to establish membership of a Facebook University network.  Universities have made use of Facebook for social and marketing purposes but there are obstacles to the incorporation of its use into 'official' educational activities. Students may object to academics entering what they see as 'their space', sometimes called the 'creepy treehouse' effect (Stein,2008) <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://flexknowlogy.learningfield.org/2008/04/09/defining-creepy-tree-house/\">[45]</a>.  Institutions may also be wary of their staff instigating dialogue in spaces where they have no control over blocking users or deleting offensive posts, yet being found guilty by association when problems occur.\nThere is a subtle difference between Blackboard's Sync Facebook application <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://wiki.blackboardsync.com/display/SYNC/About+Blackboard+Sync\">[46]</a> that pushes course information out to students and the Open University's Course Profiles\napplication <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/blogarchive/010855.html\">[47]</a> that is based on  student self-reporting and open information-sharing of recommendations on course.

This means that VLEs may lag behind Web 2.0 offerings in terms of features, tempting teachers to utilize non-institutional implementations.  Such a decision represents a trade off between reliability and richness: a risk that is more easily managed by an autonomous student than a teacher with professional responsibilities of care.  Teachers and students will negotiate delicate division of responsibilities between the formal, teacher-directed learning supported by institutional software and learning initiated by the learner using tools and in environments most suited to what and how they wish to learn.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Conclusions\">Conclusions</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Social_software_in_education&amp;action=edit&amp;section=28\" title=\"Edit section: Conclusions\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Teachers experience and reflect on their own use of social software to help them plan and evaluate use with their students. As for students social software is also a vehicle for teachers learning about technology innovations that emerge from design research and human innovation.  The evaluative research on how these innovations become embedded in practice tends to lag behind the innovation itself.  There is, however, a growing body of work on the student experience to ascertain what is appropriate and likely to be effective.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Social_software_in_education&amp;action=edit&amp;section=29\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><cite class=\"citation book\">Lee, Mark (2011). <i>Web 2.0-Based E-Learning: Applying Social Informatics for Tertiary Teaching: Applying Social Informatics for Tertiary Teaching</i>.
