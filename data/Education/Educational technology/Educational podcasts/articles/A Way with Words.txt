A Way with Words is an independent, non-profit, nationwide, weekly public radio show about language, currently broadcast around the United States of America.  It was produced by KPBS in San Diego from 1998 to 2007 and has since then been produced by Wayword, Inc. The show was originally hosted by authors Richard Lederer and Charles Harrington Elster. After five and a half years, Elster left the show and was replaced by journalist and writer Martha Barnette. In October 2006, Lederer announced his retirement from the show. He was replaced by writer and lexicographer Grant Barrett in January 2007. On August 2, 2007, KPBS announced it would stop production of A Way with Words. KPBS said that it did not have the manpower, funds, or expertise necessary to take the show to more stations across the U.S. and Canada. In September 2007, Martha Barnette and Grant Barrett, co-hosts of A Way with Words, along with the show's producer Stefanie Levine, announced that they had created a production company that would continue the show. KPBS has also agreed to continue to broadcast the show. New episodes began airing the weekend of November 24 and 25, 2007. Since then, the number of stations carrying the show has more than quadrupled.
