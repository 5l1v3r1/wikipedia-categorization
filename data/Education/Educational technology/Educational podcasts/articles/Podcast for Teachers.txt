Podcast For Teachers (PFT) is weekly talk show (podcast) on the theme of technology and education (pre K – higher ed). The show is produced by the Regional Educational Technology Center (RETC) of Fordham University in New York City. This award-winning show began production and broadcasting in August 2005. In October 2005, PFT was awarded an “Innovative Technology in Professional Development” award by the international professional association, POD Network (Professional and Organizational Network). As per its tagline, this show focuses on “Ed Tech You Can Use,” providing educators with important, easy to use, free or low-cost resources as well as essential reflections on their use and significance. While PFT offers general coverage about educational technology, it has specialized in podcasting, making it accessible to educators. Many important contributors to the field of Ed Tech are featured in the show’s interview segments, including: Bernard Percy, Laura Allen, Joel Heffner, Phil Firsenbaum, Gary Israel, and Jeff McQuillan of English as a Second Language Podcast. Among the distinctive elements that this academic podcast contributes to the worlds of technology, professional development, lifelong learning and higher education are the unusual programming that has evolved through its development. Podcast for Teachers (PFT) has been able to blend together essential elements of: a focus on professional development for educators as adult learners (King, 2003); ongoing development of many web-based resources of the PFT community; astute educational insight; updates and commentary by ed tech experts; experienced pedagogical and ed tech innovative perspectives of the co-hosts; and commitment to social justice (Freire, 1973) and equity in education (NTIA, 1999). In addition PFT has been able to create an unusual academic environment that blends these academic qualities, philosophical commitments, and occasional repartee.
