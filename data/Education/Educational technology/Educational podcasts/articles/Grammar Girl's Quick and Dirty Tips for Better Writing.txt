She was on the show to answer a viewer question about the use of possessive apostrophes.  The viewer thought a previous show should have been titled "Oprah's and Gayle's Big Adventure", but Fogarty confirmed that "Oprah and Gayle's Big Adventure" was a correct use of compound possession. She went on to discuss several other common grammar errors, including "affect vs. effect" and "who vs. whom".
