Crispen, a Pennsylvania entrepreneur, created a way to enable his ailing friend to travel from floor to floor. Crispen's idea was to design a seat that could climb stairs. A self-taught engineer, he built the first prototype of the inclining chair. He called it the Inclin-ator.\nPrior to this Frederick Muffett of Royal Tunbridge Wells, invented and patented the \"An Invalid Chair with Tramway for use on Staircases\". However,  TV historian Doctor <a href=\"/wiki/David_Starkey\" title=\"David Starkey\">David Starkey</a> has in 2009, found evidence in a list of the possessions of <a href=\"/wiki/Henry_VIII_of_England\" title=\"Henry VIII of England\">King Henry VIII</a> that attributes the first stairlift invented to the monarch.

These rails may, typically, weigh over 30&#160;kg, depending on the length.  In most applications they are attached to the steps with metal brackets (sometimes called \u201ccleats\u201d).\n</p><p>If a rail crosses a doorway at the bottom of the stairs or causes an obstruction a hinge can be fitted so the end of the rail can be folded back out of the way when not in use.\n</p><p>Curved rails are made from materials such as steel or aluminum and come in various cross-sectional shapes according to the designer.  Individual designs vary a lot and probably the key criterion is to make the curves with the smallest radius possible so they will wrap tightly around objects such as newel posts.\n</p><p>The sections of curved rails usually packaged well to prevent damage in transit and are unwrapped and assembled on site.\n</p><p>Rails for wheelchair platform stair lifts may be secured to walls in addition to the step fixings.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Carriages\">Carriages</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Stairlift&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Carriages\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Folding_seat\" title=\"Folding seat\">carriage</a> is the component which moves along the rail and normally runs on small diameter rollers.  In most designs the carriage is pulled by a cable or chain, or driven along the inclined rail by a <a href=\"/wiki/Rack_and_pinion\" title=\"Rack and pinion\">rack and pinion</a> system or other drive arrangement.\n</p><p>Most domestic carriages have a seat with arms and a footrest.  Some special models have a stand-on platform also known as a \"perch\" seat. For users with shorter legs a short seat can be fitted, to make the lift more comfortable to sit on. Seats can be tailored to suit individual needs.\n</p><p>The conventional layout for a typical domestic stair lift is to have the <a href=\"/wiki/Folding_seat\" title=\"Folding seat\">seat</a> at right angles to the rail so the user travels \"<a href=\"/wiki/Sidesaddle\" title=\"Sidesaddle\">sidesaddle</a>\".  At the top of the staircase the seat can be swiveled, commonly through around 45 degrees or 90 degrees, then locked in place to allow the user to alight from it onto a landing. Stair lifts are available with either a manual swivel or a powered swivel, depending on the users ability.\n</p><p>Most <a href=\"/wiki/Swivel_seat\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Swivel seat\">swivel seats</a> have a safety switch so the stair lift won\u2019t move unless the seat is locked into its travel position.

On staircases with intermediate flat landings they eliminate the need for multiple straight stair lifts by providing a continuous ride up the entire length of the staircase. Because the rail is custom-made to follow the staircase, and because the chair is more complex that on a straight-rail stair lift (it has to be able to remain level while traveling along a track which changes direction and angle), curved-rail stair lifts are usually more costly than stair lifts for straight stairs. Specifying a curved-rail stair lifts usually involves careful measurement, design and manufacturing, and the installation process usually takes longer than for a straight domestic stair lift.\n</p><p>Some manufacturers provide curved-rail stair lifts made from modular parts. These have the advantage of quick delivery time (the installer brings many parts and picks from them), though the rail may not follow the shape of the stairs as closely as a factory-made stair lift.

This is most common with straight rail domestic types.  The rails can be cut to length if too long, or extended with a \"joining kit\".  Most models allow the carriage to be \"re-handed\" so it can be used on the left or right side of the staircase.\n</p><p>During the early days of curved rail stair lifts there was no second user market because of the difficulty of matching rails to a different layout.  Even staircases built to the same design specification in neighboring houses have variations, but in most attempted \"transplants\" there are too many differences to make it practicable.  Many owners have had to pay to have unwanted curved stair lifts removed.\n</p><p>More recently, some curved rails have been produced to a modular design so components can be unbolted and used elsewhere, subject to design and safety considerations.  In some cases, tubular section rails which are welded during manufacture, are produced by specialist rail companies so they can be used with a previously owned carriage, controls, and other components.  This is, perhaps, like putting an old locomotive on new railway lines.  It provides a lower cost solution than buying a totally new system.\n</p><p>Some insurance companies have offered breakdown policies for stair lifts.

An \"energy chain\" ran alongside or through the rail to carry the power cable from the supply point to the carriage.\n</p><p>More recently, domestic stair lifts have been powered from rechargeable batteries and use <a href=\"/wiki/Direct_current\" title=\"Direct current\">direct current</a> (DC).  One of the selling points is that a DC stair lift will continue to function during a power outage, provided the batteries are sufficiently charged. Most stair lifts have a 'charge point' where the unit will 'park' to charge its batteries. Some straight stair lifts have the ability to charge continuously no matter where they are left along the track.\n</p><p>With most DC models the batteries are accommodated within the carriage and travel with it.\n</p><p>Some models, however, were designed with <a href=\"/wiki/Three_phase\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Three phase\">three phase</a> motors and the batteries (three in total) were housed in a cabinet mounted near the top or bottom of the rail.

This is either a switch or a toggle type lever.  This larger toggle switch enables users even with limited mobility or painful condition to use stair lifts easily and safely.\n</p><p>Electronic controls are used extensively. Many stair lifts have radio frequency or <a href=\"/wiki/Infrared\" title=\"Infrared\">infrared</a> remote controllers. It is known that radiation from devices such as fluorescent lights can interfere with infrared stair lift controls. Also, heat and <a href=\"/wiki/Incandescent\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Incandescent\">incandescent</a> lights can, in some circumstances, have an adverse effect.\n</p><p>Control circuit design varies greatly among the different manufacturers and models.\nCurved rail stair lifts have more complex controls than those with straight rails.\n</p><p>The seat of a curved rail stair lift may have to be tilted so it remains horizontal whilst going around curves and negotiates different angles of incline.  This requires an additional motor and link system.\n</p><p>Also, the carriage is slowed down on bends but travels faster on straight runs.  This means a more complex control system.  Modern controls have small microprocessors which \u201clearn\u201d the characteristics of the journeys and keep the data in memory.  They also record the number of journey and direction.  This assists service engineers on maintenance calls.\n</p><p>Some development of self-diagnostic controls began at the onset of the 21st Century.
