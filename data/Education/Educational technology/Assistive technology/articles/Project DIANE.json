After a year of deliberations and two successful community based field pilots, Project DIANE was given <a href=\"/wiki/Venture_capital\" title=\"Venture capital\">startup funding</a> by the TVA.\n</p><p>The two field  pilots, named the Nashville Pilot and the City Share Pilot were instrumental in demonstrating that videoconferencing technology was a viable and highly flexible mechanism through which to deliver a broad array of educational, economic development and public service resources to the general public. Both pilots were carried out with the participation of several dozen community service organizations, <a href=\"/wiki/Government_agency\" title=\"Government agency\">governmental agencies</a> and corporations.\n</p><p>Primary sponsors and underwriters of the two pilots included TVA, <a href=\"/wiki/BellSouth\" title=\"BellSouth\">BellSouth</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/IBM\" title=\"IBM\">IBM</a>, and PictureTel (later purchased by <a href=\"/wiki/Polycom\" title=\"Polycom\">Polycom</a>). The Nashville Pilot was an intracity test of desktop <a href=\"/wiki/Videoconferencing\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Videoconferencing\">videoconferencing</a> technology with application test sites in <a href=\"/wiki/Nashville,_Tennessee\" title=\"Nashville, Tennessee\">Nashville, Tennessee</a> constructed at <a href=\"/wiki/Tennessee_State_University\" title=\"Tennessee State University\">Tennessee State University</a>, Cumberland Science Museum (later renamed the Adventure Science Center) and the Looby Public Library.\n</p><p>One month after conclusion of the Nashville Pilot, the City Share Pilot testbed was created by connecting the three Nashville video test locations to additional video sites constructed in <a href=\"/wiki/Huntsville,_Alabama\" title=\"Huntsville, Alabama\">Huntsville, Alabama</a>. A large portfolio of community oriented and educational test applications between Nashville and Huntsville were launched with a 40-minute discussion of <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/intercity\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikt:intercity\">intercity</a> cooperation between the <a href=\"/wiki/Mayor\" title=\"Mayor\">mayors</a> of the cities. It is believed that the City Share pilot was the first ever intercity videoconference link ever constructed for non-commercial purposes.\n</p><p>In the years following the project's pilot startup, many public and private organizations participated in the network's public service programming and donated both in-kind and financial resources.  Network participants and supporters were also successful in securing a wide bevy of public and private grants to pay for different types of community applications which utilized the project.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Overview\">Overview</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Project_DIANE&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Overview\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Project_objectives\">Project objectives</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Project_DIANE&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Project objectives\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Project DIANE's primary objectives were to: \n</p>\n<ol><li>develop a successful electronic community service network that could be expanded and/or replicated by all interested members of the community,</li>\n<li>bring education institutions, business development agencies, and community service organizations closer together for cooperative sharing of scarce public and private resources and</li>\n<li>provide needy individuals and groups with free, or low cost, digital access to useful information, assistance and professional expertise.</li></ol>\n<p>There were two notable aspects about the network. First, the project was designed as a broad-based, rather than niche-focused, community <a href=\"/wiki/Telecollaboration\" title=\"Telecollaboration\">telecollaboration</a>. DIANE membership reflected a wide spectrum of <a href=\"/wiki/Community_organizations\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Community organizations\">community organizations</a> which came together online to jointly plan and carry out public programs and services.\n</p><p>The project was represented by most segments of the community, both in an organizational context (e.g., schools, community centers, libraries, business agencies, etc.) and individually (child through senior adult, families, handicapped, urban and rural, etc.) DIANE was inherently a \"project of projects\" with teleconferencing applications in the three target areas of education, community service and economic development.\n</p><p>A second key aspect of this project was that, from its inception, DIANE members worked diligently to include disadvantaged or neglected members of society in consortium program development activities. The avoidance of a two-tier cyber-society of \"haves\" vs. \"have-nots\" was a high priority. DIANE members took special care to include low income inner city residents, <a href=\"/wiki/Developmental_disability\" title=\"Developmental disability\">developmentally disabled children</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Senior_citizen\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Senior citizen\">senior citizens</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Speech_disorder\" title=\"Speech disorder\">speech</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Hearing_impairment\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hearing impairment\">hearing impaired</a> individuals, and other potential information highway have-nots in program development activities.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Participants\">Participants</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Project_DIANE&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Participants\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Online members of the consortium included family and <a href=\"/wiki/Community_centre\" title=\"Community centre\">community centers</a>, speech &amp; hearing treatment centers, <a href=\"/wiki/K%E2%80%9312_(education)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"K\u201312 (education)\">K-12 schools</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Zoo\" title=\"Zoo\">zoos</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Museum\" title=\"Museum\">museums</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Public_library\" title=\"Public library\">public libraries</a>, universities, language institutes, skill training centers, <a href=\"/wiki/Chambers_of_commerce\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Chambers of commerce\">chambers of commerce</a>, economic development agencies, healthcare groups, overseas military bases &amp; dependents schools, and other service organizations.\n</p><p>Specific notable members of the project included the <a href=\"/wiki/Small_Business_Administration\" title=\"Small Business Administration\">Small Business Administration</a> sponsored Small Business Development Centers, the Tennessee Foreign Language Institute, the Adventure Science Center, <a href=\"/wiki/Vanderbilt_University\" title=\"Vanderbilt University\">Vanderbilt University</a>, the Tennessee Foreign Language Institute, Tennessee League for the Deaf &amp; Hard of Hearing, the Nashville Zoo, the Metropolitan Action Commission, <a href=\"/wiki/Urban_League\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Urban League\">Urban League</a> of Nashville, the <a href=\"/wiki/Boys_%26_Girls_Clubs_of_America\" title=\"Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America\">Boys &amp; Girls Club</a>, the <a href=\"/wiki/Girl_Scouts_of_the_USA\" title=\"Girl Scouts of the USA\">Girl Scouts</a> of Middle Tennessee, the Catholic Diocese of Nashville, the <a href=\"/wiki/Tennessee_State_Library_and_Archives\" title=\"Tennessee State Library and Archives\">Tennessee State Library &amp; Archives</a>, the <a href=\"/wiki/The_Elephant_Sanctuary_(Hohenwald)\" title=\"The Elephant Sanctuary (Hohenwald)\">Elephant Sanctuary</a> of Hohenwald, the Nashville Public Library System, the <a href=\"/wiki/Bank_of_America\" title=\"Bank of America\">Bank of America</a> Small Business Resource Centers, and the <a href=\"/wiki/U.S._Department_of_Defense\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"U.S. Department of Defense\">U.S. Department of Defense</a> Overseas Dependents School System.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Real-time_telecollaboration\">Real-time telecollaboration</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Project_DIANE&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Real-time telecollaboration\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Telecollaboration was inherently the method by which DIANE organizations educated and assisted one another. Real-time telecollaboration took place in all project activities through two-way electronic exchanges between a resource provider (such as a K-12 teacher, college professor, business counselor, social worker, therapist, or other expert professional) and a person in need (e.g., student, small/minority business entrepreneur, researcher, family member, handicapped person, senior citizen, etc.).

In addition to the general program descriptions given in this section, interested parties were able to click to the Project DIANE Directory and read the \"DIANE Program &amp; Resource Profile\" for each individual organization. General teleconference based program areas established by the project included: the Economic Development Partnership, Tennessee Child Development Partnership, Teachers' Teleconferencing Curriculum Forum, Internet Distance Training, Global Community Project, and others.\n</p><p>Examples of specific program activities within these general program areas included the following: The Tennessee League for the Hearing Impaired offered videoconferencing-based <a href=\"/wiki/Deaf_culture\" title=\"Deaf culture\">Deaf culture</a> workshops, <a href=\"/wiki/Sign_language\" title=\"Sign language\">sign language</a> instruction, and <a href=\"/wiki/Video_Relay_Service\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Video Relay Service\">translation services</a>. Looby Metro Public Library supported a distance <a href=\"/wiki/Mentor\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Mentor\">mentorship</a> program called \"Adopt-a-Grandparent\" in which senior citizen library volunteers provide guidance and counseling to disadvantaged youth who called in from DIANE's community center locations. Therapists and physicians at the Bill Wilkerson Speech &amp; Hearing Center and the Vanderbilt Child Development Center electronically assisted disabled children, including adolescents with <a href=\"/wiki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">autism</a> and related communication disorders. High school students and teachers regularly consulted online with the project's educational resources such as the Cumberland Science Museum (e.g., for science information, environmental workshops, etc.) and to <a href=\"/wiki/Meharry_Medical_College\" title=\"Meharry Medical College\">Meharry Medical College</a> (e.g., to learn about viruses), etc.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Electronic_field_trips\">Electronic field trips</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Project_DIANE&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Electronic field trips\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The use of <a href=\"/wiki/Videotelephony\" title=\"Videotelephony\">videoconferencing technology</a> to electronically and interactively take students to exotic and faraway places was pioneered by Project DIANE.
