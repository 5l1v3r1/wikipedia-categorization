TrackR is a commercial  key finder which assists in the tracking of lost belongings and devices.  Trackr is produced by the company Phone Halo   and was inspired by the founders losing their keys on  beach during a surfing trip.  The founders of Phone Halo began working on TrackR in 2009, and founded the company in 2010, launching the product the same year.  The device contains a lithium battery, that has to be changed about every year by the user.  The communication of the device's current location is made through Bluetooth 4.0 to an iOS 8.0+ or Android 4.4+ smartphone or tablet with the TrackR app installed and running. This feature is referred to as "Crowd Locate" since those devices will report the location any and all TrackR devices including those that are not owned or registered by the user. If the app is not installed on that nearby Bluetooth enabled device, the location cannot be relayed. As of August 2017, they have sold over 5 million devices.
