KOMP is a communication device for seniors,   developed by the Norwegian startup No Isolation. The KOMP device is placed at the senior's home, while family members or friends send photos, messages or start video calls from an app for iOS and Android. The product was launched November 2017. The device also supports widgets, like weather alerts provided by the Norwegian Meteorological Institute. The project received a Seal of Excellence from the European Commission with the proposal “KOMP - the one-button communication device tailored to put an end to loneliness among seniors” as part of the Horizon 2020 SME instrument phase 2 in the category “Accelerating market introduction of ICT solutions for Health, Well-Being and Ageing Well.”
