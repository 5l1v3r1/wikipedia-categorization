In Canada and the United States, the 711 telephone number is used for the Telecommunications Relay Service to translate from TDD for the deaf to speech, and vice versa.  The relay service allows deaf people to converse with the hearing over the phone through an operator.  711 is one of eight N11 codes for abbreviated dialing in the North American Numbering Plan. In the U.S., every phone company is required to connect persons who dial 711 to a TRS call center from a working number.  In July 2007, the Federal Communications Commission ruled that the 711 requirement extended to VOIP telephony.
