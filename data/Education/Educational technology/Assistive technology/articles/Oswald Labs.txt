  Oswald Labs (formerly Oswald Foundation) is an India and Netherlands-based accessibility technology company that builds products for individuals with disabilities.   It was established in 2016 by then 18-year-old Anand Chowdhary and 15-year-old Nishant Gadihoke after their product, Oswald Extension, won an event at the AngelHack hackathon in New Delhi.    In an interview with The Huffington Post, Chowdhary said that he believes "Oswald [Labs] can enable a Web 4.0, a web centered around accessibility and equality".   Oswald Labs is named in honor of Oswald Berkhan, the German physician who first identified dyslexia in 1881.  Chowdhary and Gadihoke started working together as students at The Mother's International School, as part of their computer club, MINET, of which Chowdhary was President.  Chowdhary shared his idea of developing an accessibility tool with Gadihoke, and they decided to develop the extension during AngelHack Delhi 2016.  After the development of the tool, Chowdhary and Gadihoke purchased the domain oswald.foundation on 14 August 2016 and founded Oswald Labs as Oswald Foundation on India's Independence Day on 15 August 2016 along with Mahendra Singh Raghuwanshi, Chowdhary's partner in previous ventures.  Oswald Labs won an award at Startup India Rocks in Bengaluru and is a part of IBM's Global Entrepreneur Program.   They are also incubated in the London and Berlin-based EyeFocus Accelerator, a startup accelerator program for companies developing for living with visual impairment.  In November 2016, Oswald Labs announced that they switched to wind-powered servers for their online services and content delivery network.   On 8 April 2017, Oswald Labs qualified to the finals of The Economic Times's Catapoolt Changemakers Challenge after winning the first round in Delhi.  On 17 and 18 June 2017, Oswald Labs organized BharatHacks, a hackathon to solve India-specific problems, in collaboration with DigitalOcean, IBM, the Delhi-NCR chapter of Facebook Developer Circles, HackerEarth, and other technology companies.   In June 2017, Oswald Labs raised â‚¹100,000 in a crowdfunding campaign.
