Spoken Web is a web portal, managing a wide range of online data-intensive content like Wikipedia articles, news updates, weather, travel and business articles for computer users who are blind or visually impaired. Spoken Web is based in Tel Aviv, Israel.  Spoken Web was founded by Eyal Shalom in 2006.  The site provides a simple, easy-to-use interface for navigating between the different sections and articles. Using the keyboard to navigate, everybody can hear the full range of an article content provided in a logical, clear, and understandable manner.  Navigation uses three keys: 'TAB' to pass from item to item, 'Enter' to select an item and 'Backspace' to go back to previous page.
