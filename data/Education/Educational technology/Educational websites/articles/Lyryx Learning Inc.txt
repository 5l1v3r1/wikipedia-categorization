Lyryx Learning (Lyryx) is an educational software company offering open educational resources (OERs) paired with affordable online homework for undergraduate introductory courses in Mathematics & Statistics and Business & Economics. In 1997, Claude Laflamme and Keith Nicholson, Professors in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Calgary, began work on the design of online tools to support student learning in their classes. Laflamme and Nicholson developed and implemented a formative assessment system which provided immediate, substantive feedback to students based on their work. In 2000, Laflamme and Nicholson, together with two software developers, Bruce Bauslaugh and Richard Cannings, formed Lyryx Learning Inc., to offer this platform in a number of quantitative disciplines. By 2010, Lyryx supported approximately 100,000 students and 2,000 instructors per year in Canada. After several years of developing formative online assessment for content from various publishers, including  McGraw-Hill Ryerson in Canada and Flat World Knowledge in the US,  Lyryx became a fully independent publisher supporting OERs in 2013 with the launch of Lyryx with Open Texts. To support the use of OERs in large enrollment undergraduate introductory courses in Mathematics & Statistics and Business & Economics, Lyryx moved to a social enterprise business model: Funding from the online homework supports both the development and maintenance of OERs as well as contributions to the community. In addition, Lyryx also offers an option of free access to their online homework from an institution's computer labs. Lyryx with Open Texts includes: Accounting Economics Mathematics In addition to lyryx.com, Lyryx Learning open textbooks are also listed in the following repositories: Lyryx with Open Texts received a "2017 Honorable Mention" from the Open Education Consortium
