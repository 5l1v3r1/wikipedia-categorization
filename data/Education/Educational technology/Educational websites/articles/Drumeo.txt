Drumeo, an acronym for drum education online, is an online drum learning platform known for offering drum lessons to students.   Drumeo was  launched  in 2012 by  Jared Falk  and Rick Kettner  with its physical location in Abbotsford, British Columbia, Canada.   Prior to the launching of the  platform, Jared had been teaching private drum lessons touring as musician for years.  Rick, on the other hand, used to film simple video lessons for online drum message boards. Both later teamed up and created the online drum learning platform.  In 2016, Drumeo released the Drumeo P4 Practice Pad which offers four different playing surfaces, compared to the traditional one-surface practice pads.  It was designed by New York drummer Pat Petrillo.  Drumeo hosts a YouTube channel for drummers and offers  video drum lessons through a subscription model called Drumeo Edge.    The platform also hosts notable drummers who come along to offer free live drum lessons to students from time to time.    Drumeo has notable drummers that offer lessons. Among them include Bernard Purdie, Antonio Sanchez, Todd Sucherman, Mark Guiliana, Kenny Aronoff, and others.  Among the notable students of the platform includes Petr ÄŒech, Arsenal soccer goalie.
