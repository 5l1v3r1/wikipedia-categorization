StuDocu is a crowdsourced online learning and sharing platform for students where students can share study material. StuDocu is mainly used for book summaries, lecture notes and exam questions. Their business model is based on subscription access for premium documents.   StuDocu was founded in 2013 by four students at the Technical University of Delft as Studeersnel.nl, the Dutch version of the website. After noticing that a lot of useful study materials were only available to a few well-connected students they worked to create an open platform that was accessible by everyone.  In 2014 StuDocu received an angel investment of €125,000 from one of the founders of the Dutch social media platform Hyves, Koen Kam.  In 2015 Peak Capital and Point Nine Capital invested €1,35 Million.   In 2016 StuDocu was nominated for the EY Dutch Entrepreneur of the year award.  StuDocu allows users to upload past exams from their university courses and, in most cases, the universities own the copyright on these documents and, as a result, requests are often made to remove these types of documents.  In 2014 nearly all students from a course at the University of Groningen got 10/10 on their exam, because the instructor for the class used an old exam that was available on StuDocu.
