Push describes itself as \"the ruthlessly independent guide to UK universities\" and uses the tagline \"Push\u2026 like it is\".\n</p><p>Previously, Push published a range of books including <i>The Push Guide to Which University</i>, <i>The Push Guide to Money</i> and <i>The Push Guide to Choosing a University</i>, but these are now out of print and their content has been updated, extended and incorporated into the Push website. In association with various sponsors, Push also conducts an annual tour of schools and sixth-form colleges, delivering guidance talks and reaching around 200 institutions each year.\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#History\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">History</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Research\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Research</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Trivia\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Trivia</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#See_also\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">See also</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#External_links\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">External links</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"History\">History</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=PUSH_(university_guide)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: History\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Push was founded in 1992 by two brothers, Johnny Rich and Ben Rich, to publish the <a href=\"/wiki/Polytechnic_(United_Kingdom)\" title=\"Polytechnic (United Kingdom)\">Polytechnic</a> and University Student Handbook. It differed from other similar books because they did not give copy approval to the universities included and covered a wider range of concerns, particularly those relating to non-academic features of student life. The first edition of the book coincided with legislation that led to the transformation of all British polytechnics into universities, but the acronym was retained as the book had provoked considerable media interest. In particular, attention focused on what Push called 'flunk rates' (i.e. the proportion of students who dropped out or failed their courses), which were revealed in a comparative form for the first time.\n</p><p>The website was launched in 1996 and, shortly afterwards, Ben Rich left Push as his career in public relations demanded too much of his time.\n</p><p>Johnny Rich still manages the organisation as editor and is an acknowledged authority on university applications and student life and finance. He makes regular media appearances.\n</p><p>In 2005, Push became a division of <a href=\"/wiki/Independent_News_%26_Media\" title=\"Independent News &amp; Media\">Independent News &amp; Media</a>, publishers of <a href=\"/wiki/The_Independent\" title=\"The Independent\">The Independent</a> newspaper. Push left The Independent in 2010 and merged with Real World, a print and online magazine providing careers information and advice for graduates.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Research\">Research</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=PUSH_(university_guide)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Research\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Push's research methodology is significantly different from similar resources such as <a href=\"/wiki/League_tables_of_British_universities\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"League tables of British universities\">league tables of British universities</a> published by several UK newspapers. Although it uses publicly available data from <a href=\"/wiki/Higher_Education_Statistics_Agency\" title=\"Higher Education Statistics Agency\">Higher Education Statistics Agency</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/National_Student_Survey\" title=\"National Student Survey\">National Student Survey</a> and other sources, Push also originates most of its own research from a series of lengthy questionnaires sent to the universities and students unions and from annual site visits by Push's own research team to every UK university. These visits involve face-to-face interviews with students from the university.\n</p><p>This research is published in the form of detailed profiles of each university and in a number of statistical tables and top ten lists for individual criteria.\n</p><p>The following are among the statistics exclusive to Push:\n</p>\n<ul><li>The Push Student Debt Survey: This is the largest annual survey of student debt in the UK that does not rely on self-selecting participants. Instead it surveys over 2,000 interviewees, including a minimum of 15 from each university. It is the only survey to provide a comparative breakdown of average student debts for each institution.</li>\n<li>The Booze Index: An index of average student drinks prices, based on the weighted cost of a pint of beer, a glass of wine and a glass of orange juice bought in the student bar and a local pub.</li>\n<li>Flunk rates: Based on <a href=\"/wiki/Higher_Education_Statistics_Agency\" title=\"Higher Education Statistics Agency\">HESA</a>'s 'non-completion' data, this table shows the proportion of students who do not successfully complete the degree courses on which they enrol.</li>\n<li>The Student Living Costs Survey: A weighted index showing the comparative costs of living and studying at each university in the UK, based on accommodation costs, entertainments and a basket of goods that a student is likely to buy.</li></ul>\n<p>Media attention is also often given to data published about sex ratios at each university, clearing rates (i.e. the proportion of student arriving through the <a href=\"/wiki/UCAS\" title=\"UCAS\">UCAS</a> clearing system), the availability and cost of housing, famous alumni and the provision of welfare.\n</p><p>Push has a stated opposition to the <a href=\"/wiki/League_tables_of_British_universities\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"League tables of British universities\">league tables of British universities</a> and Johnny Rich has been outspoken on the subject on a number of occasions. Push's position is that \"Any university ranking is based on what its inventors think is important, but their priorities may be a snail's hike from yours.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> In an effort to prove the point and provoke controversy, on <a href=\"/wiki/April_Fools%27_Day\" title=\"April Fools&#39; Day\">April Fools' Day</a> 2008 Push published its own alternative league table which used what it argued were more student-centred criteria and which featured very different universities at the top of the list. These included \n<a href=\"/wiki/Lampeter_University\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Lampeter University\">Lampeter University</a> in first place and two institutions \u2013 <a href=\"/wiki/Harper_Adams_University_College\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Harper Adams University College\">Harper Adams University College</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Bishop_Grosseteste_University_College\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Bishop Grosseteste University College\">Bishop Grosseteste University College</a> \u2013 which had only gained full university status in the past year. Neither <a href=\"/wiki/Oxford_University\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Oxford University\">Oxford University</a> nor <a href=\"/wiki/Cambridge_University\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cambridge University\">Cambridge University</a> made it into the top ten.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Trivia\">Trivia</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=PUSH_(university_guide)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Trivia\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Push makes extensive use of interesting snippets of information about universities and student life. For example:\n</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/University_of_York\" title=\"University of York\">University of York</a> has the highest duck:student ratio of any campus in Europe.</li>\n<li>Push claims that the full name of <a href=\"/wiki/Jesus_College,_Cambridge\" title=\"Jesus College, Cambridge\">Jesus College, Cambridge</a> is The College of the Holy Trinity and the Most Blessed and Exalted Virgin St Radegund. This name is both incomplete and inaccurate\u2014the actual official name is \"The College of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Saint John the Evangelist and the glorious Virgin Saint Radegund, near Cambridge\".</li>\n<li>Staff and students at the <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_Dundee\" title=\"University of Dundee\">University of Dundee</a> rehearsed and produced <i>Seven Brides for Seven Brothers</i> in 23 hours and 30 mins and now hold the world record for the fastest ever staging of a musical.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/The_Archbishop_of_Canterbury\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Archbishop of Canterbury\">The Archbishop of Canterbury</a> is the only person in the country who can award degrees personally and, legally speaking, he is a university.</li>\n<li>Teaching staff at
