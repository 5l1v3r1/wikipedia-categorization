Encyclopædia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite is an encyclopædia based on the Encyclopædia Britannica and published by Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.. The DVD contains over 100,000 articles, an atlas, around 35,000 media files (images, video and audio)  and a dictionary and thesaurus based on Merriam-Webster. Encyclopædia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite received the 2004 Distinguished Achievement Award from the Association of Educational Publishers.  Its predecessor, Britannica DVD, received Codie awards in 2000, 2001 and 2002.   There is no official release of Britannica for the Linux operating system; however, a script is provided that can help experienced users run Encyclopædia Britannica 2004 Ultimate Reference Suite DVD (and other 2004 editions of Britannica) on Linux, with some limitations (for example the dictionary, Flash/QuickTime presentations, and content update functions do not work, and preferences must be edited manually).   This script specifically requires version 1.3.1 of JRE, but can usually be made to work with newer versions if the version check is commented out.
