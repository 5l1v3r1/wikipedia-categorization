Memrise is a user-generated learning platform which uses flashcards as memory aids. It specialises in language learning, but also offers content on a wide range of other subjects. Memrise has more than 150 language courses across 25 languages. The app has over 20 million registered users.  Memrise has been profitable since late 2016.  Memrise was founded by Ed Cooke, a Grand Master of Memory, and Greg Detre, a Princeton neuroscientist specializing in the science of memory and forgetting. The website launched in private beta after winning the Princeton Entrepreneurship Club 2009 TigerLaunch competition.  On October 1, 2012, 100 users were allowed to sign up to test a non-beta version of the website called Memrise 1.0. As of May 2013, a Memrise app has been available for download on both the App Store (iOS) and Google Play.  In May 2017, Memrise was named as the overall Best App winner of the second edition of the Google Play awards.  The Awards celebrate achievements of the developer community across the globe over the past year and recognise the best apps and games covering twelve categories.  Selected by a panel of experts, the winners are evaluated on quality, innovation, and major launches or updates over the past year. In July 2010, Memrise was named as one of the winners of the London Mini-Seedcamp competition.  In November 2010, the site was named as one of the finalists for the 2010 TechCrunch Europas Start-up of the Year.  In March 2011, it was selected as one of the Techstars Boston startups.  In late September 2012, the leaderboard on the website was temporarily suspended due to "extensive cheating". Specific users had been using bots and non-intensive mechanisms, such as celebrity photo memory courses, to achieve atypical scores that were not reflective of actual learning. In response, the administrators established a new leaderboard after revising the scoring loopholes.
