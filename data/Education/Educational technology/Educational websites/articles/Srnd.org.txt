srnd.org (sometimes stylized "srnd") is a non-profit organization which promotes STEM education for high school students. The organization is headquartered in Seattle, Washington, but operates programs for 25,000 students in 40 cities,  focusing on new programmers from diverse backgrounds.They run several programs, but are best known for a 24-hour coding event called CodeDay.   srnd.org was founded in 2009 by Edward Jiang  as Student Research and Development (which is still the organization's legal name),  and was initially a makerspace for students and high school accelerator,  helping to start several successful companies.        The early days of the organization were profiled in the book, Be a Changemaker: How to Start Something That Matters.  The original mission of srnd.org was to "create the next generation of technologists" through makerspaces,  however srnd.org closed its makerspace in 2013, citing lack of attendance and high costs, and began focusing entirely on CodeDay.  Around the same time, srnd.org adopted its current mission of "increasing Computer Science enrollment nationwide", as well as focusing on attracting diverse students. Despite this focus on diversity, it does not promote to any single demographic, reporting a combined diversity of 68% women, low-income, African American, and Latino students (compared to the industry norm of 14%).    By 2017, more than 25,000 students without experience had taken part in srnd.org's programs, and 18,000 continued to code.  srnd.org started its CodeDay program in 2012,  a series of 24-hour programming competitions run across the US every few months, usually on long weekends.  CodeDay is currently hosted in 40 cities,  focusing on areas traditionally underserved by tech education programs.  All cities run CodeDay simultaneously, and are hosted at local tech companies or co-working spaces, and funded by local donations, sponsorships,  and a $10 entrance fee, which some consider controversial.  The events run 24 hours with pitches at the beginning and presentations at the end; many students program for the entire event.  Many students who attend CodeDay have little or no experience before attending.  The goal of CodeDay is to get these students to continue to pursue Computer Science after they leave. srnd.org also runs two other programs: a summer and winter break program for high school students called CodeBreak, and an online community.
