Maths Pathway is an online educational website based in Melbourne, used in Australian schools to teach mathematics. It differs from traditional mathematics teaching, as it is set up in a modular format, with students working on individual pieces of learning.   Maths Pathway was created in 2015 by Richard Wilson and Justin Matthys, both teachers that had experienced their nation's decline in mathematics rankings and were concerned about automation leading to jobs requiring higher mathematical skill. It started out as a small website headquartered in a shed in Matthys' lawn, but has grown to be featured in over 170+ schools  and is used by 12,000+ students.  Wilson and Matthys hope to have most Australian schools use it eventually.  Math Pathway uses a modular format where students select their work based on what proficiency level they are at, as opposed to every student completing the same tasks. Students are then required to be tested on what they have learned every fortnight. To use Maths Pathway, schools must pay a fee for each student.
