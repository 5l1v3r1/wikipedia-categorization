Bitesize is the BBC's free online study support resource for school-age students in the United Kingdom. It is designed to aid students in both schoolwork and, for older students, exams.  The Key Stage 1 section covers 18 subjects: Art and Design, Computing, Design and Technology, English, French, Geography, , History, Mandarin, Maths, Modern Foreign Languages, Music, Physical Education, PSHE and Citizenship, Religious Education, Science, and Spanish.   The Key Stage 2 site covers the same 18 subjects.   The Key Stage 3 section contains 33 sections.  The GCSE section of the website contains 37 subjects.  Until 2014, the Standard Grade section of the site had 12 subjects: Biology, History, Chemistry,  Computing Studies, Maths, English, Modern Studies, French, Physical Education, Geography, and Physics.  The site was updated in 2014 to replace the Standard Grade section with the National 4 and National 5 sections. Gaelic versions of the National 4 and National 5 sections were also added. Until 2014, in the Higher section, Biology, English, Geography, Maths, Chemistry, History, Modern Studies, Physics and the Scotland-only subject Scottish Gaelic were available. The Higher section was also updated to the new Curriculum for Excellence qualification. Early and 1st level, 2nd level, 3rd level, and 4th level resources were added to bring the site in line with the Curriculum for Excellence. The CS3 and TGAU sections are in Welsh. Links to the English language KS1/KS2/KS3/GCSE sections are included.   In 2014, a Northern Ireland section was added to the site. It solely contains links to the English language KS1/KS2/KS3/GCSE sections.
