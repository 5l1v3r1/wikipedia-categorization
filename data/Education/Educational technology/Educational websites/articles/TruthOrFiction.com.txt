TruthOrFiction.com was founded by Rich Buhler, a journalist, speaker, and author who was also known as the "Father of Modern Christian Talk Radio" at KBRT.  The topics are researched by TruthOrFiction's staff, and rated "Truth" (if true), or "Fiction" (if untrue). When the accuracy is not known with certainty, the stories are rated "Unproven," "Disputed," "Reported to be Truth" or "Reported to be Fiction."  Partially true stories are rated "Truth & Fiction," "Truth But Inaccurate Details," or similar.    TruthOrFiction has been referenced by news media and other online websites such as the Florida Times Union  which said that: TruthorFiction.com was founded in 1999 by the late Rich Buhler... who researched and wrote about urban legends for more than 30 years, according to various media reports. Its staff researches the rumors; original sources are usually listed or linked, so it is a good site to corroborate facts.Unlike other similar websites, TruthOrFiction.com does not primarily provide fact-checking about current events. Rather, it often addresses wild and amazing claims, pictures, or stories that resurface cyclically. Some stories resurface every year, or every election year, while some suddenly re-appear after years of dormancy.
