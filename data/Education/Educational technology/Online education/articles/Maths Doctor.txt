Maths Doctor is a UK-based online tuition agency,   located at Sussex University Innovation Centre.  Maths Doctor was founded in Brighton, Sussex in 2008 by Simon Walsh, a Chartered Financial Analyst and former teacher.  Walsh initially worked as an investment banker before re-training as a secondary maths teacher. After teaching in both independent and state schools, Walsh generated the concept of individually tailored online tuition sessions, culminating in his creation of Maths Doctor and its online tuition services. In 2012, the agency was acquired by the educational organisation Macmillan Digital Education.  Maths Doctor founder Simon Walsh was assigned as Managing Director of Maths Doctor following its acquisition. The agency has a network of over 500 tutors across the United Kingdom, delivering live online lessons. All Maths Doctor tutors are DBS checked and receive training according to Local Safeguarding Children Board procedures and Department of Education guidelines.  Maths Doctor tutors facilitate live one-to-one home tutoring via the internet, as well as worksheets and tutoring videos. To use these services, students receive an electronic pen and pad which connects to their computer via USB allowing students to access a shared white board with their tutor.  Tutors offer preparation for various academic levels including Primary, Secondary and Further Education. Regular curriculum support and examination preparation is offered for 11+ and Common Entrance exams, KS2, KS3, GCSE, AS & A-Level, STEP and University examinations. In 2010, Maths Doctor won the Midas Touch Award for Innovation at the London Business Start Up exhibition.  In 2014, the company was announced as winner of the Private Tutoring Company category at the Education Investor Awards.  Maths Doctor's online learning practices have also been covered by press agencies and online educational forums including The Huffington Post, Forbes,  Mumsnet and The Good Schools Guide.
