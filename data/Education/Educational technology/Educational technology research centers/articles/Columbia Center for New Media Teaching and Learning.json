The Task Force committed itself to the notion that any viable program fostering the integration of informational technology must be structured in such a way that the value of risk-taking would be clearly evident and occasional failures would be viewed as opportunities for future success. In this regard, it was deemed to be of the utmost importance that a means to achieve broad implementation of digital technologies be found. The Task Force unanimously agreed upon and mandated that the University create a service, support, and development group to provide assistance and advice in matters of digital and communications technology and new media to Columbia University's faculty and instructional staff.\n</p><p>In collaboration with faculty, this new group would help to create innovative pedagogical approaches to course content through the use of advanced technologies that would significantly alter and enhance various instructional environments. The same organization would serve as the campus hub for technology initiatives as they relate to the classroom. Activities would entail developing means to augment academic quality and learning environments at Columbia University. Hence, the Task Force gave its wholehearted endorsement of what was to become the Columbia Center for New Media Teaching and Learning (CCNMTL) as a collaborative effort building on the success of Academic Information Systems (AcIS) and the Institute for Learning Technologies (ILT). CCNMTL, rooted in the pedagogy developed by ILT, is buttressed by the superior network and computer systems provided by AcIS. Thus, the University's intention to combine inventiveness and the efficacious use of advanced instructional technologies and their broad dissemination was realized in CCNMTL.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Leadership\">Leadership</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Columbia_Center_for_New_Media_Teaching_and_Learning&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Leadership\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The Columbia Center for New Media Teaching and Learning, was led by co-founders <a href=\"/wiki/Frank_Moretti\" title=\"Frank Moretti\">Frank Moretti</a> and A.

The Center's educational technologists have extensive pedagogical training and offer advice and direction to faculty who wish to discover and develop best practices in the educational uses of new media.\n</p><p>These efforts often lead to the creation of a course website that offers students convenient access to online course information, including custom content, selections from Columbia's Digital Library Collection, and communication tools. CCNMTL's educational technologists assist faculty and instructors interested in using CourseWorks, Columbia University's course management system, and Columbia Wikispaces, a service from <a href=\"/wiki/Wikispaces\" title=\"Wikispaces\">Wikispaces.com</a> that provides a wiki to every registered course at Columbia University. In 2008, CCNMTL also launched <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://itunes.columbia.edu/\">Columbia on iTunes U</a>, which allows Columbia students, faculty, and the public to download free lectures, seminars, and other Columbia-produced media content to mobile devices or personal computers via Apple's <a href=\"/wiki/ITunes\" title=\"ITunes\">iTunes</a>.

Its projects include visualization and modeling tools; real-time data collection tools; data sharing programs; annotation and study tools; media archives; training environments; simulations and multimedia study environments.

In a virtual world of extreme poverty, disease, and environmental variability, students are challenged to help a family of two survive and prosper over a fifty-year period. By making decisions regarding the family's allocation of time and financial resources, students develop a greater understanding of the manifold disciplines\u2014such as agronomy, nutrition, economics, epidemiology, public health and development management\u2014that constitute sustainable development and how those disciplines interact with each other in \"real world\" scenarios.\n</p><p><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/civil-war-reconstruction-1850-1861-columbiax-hist1-1x#.VRS3hPnF_w8\">The Civil War and Reconstruction - 1850 -1861</a><br />\nA House Divided: The Road to Civil War, 1850-1861 is a course that begins by examining how generations of historians have explained the crisis of the Union.  After discussing the institution of slavery and its central role in the southern and national economies, it turns to an account of the political and social history of the 1850s.  It traces how the issue of the expansion of slavery came to dominate national politics, and how political leaders struggled, unsuccessfully, to resolve the growing crisis. We will examine the impact of key events such as Bleeding Kansas, the Dred Scott decision, the Lincoln-Douglas debates, and John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry, and end with the dissolution of the Union in the winter of 1860-61.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"External_links\">External links</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Columbia_Center_for_New_Media_Teaching_and_Learning&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: External links\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://ccnmtl.columbia.edu/\">CCNMTL home page</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://ccnmtl.columbia.edu/nme2013/\">New Media In Education 2013 hosted by CCNMTL</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://ccnmtl.columbia.edu/nme2008/\">New Media In Education 2008 hosted by CCNMTL</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://ccnmtl.columbia.edu/seminars/\">University Seminar on New Media Teaching and Learning</a></li></ul>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw2184\nCached time: 20180918193818\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.092 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.128 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 563/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 24568/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 6492/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 10/40\nExpensive parser function count: 2/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\nLua time usage: 0.039/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 1.6 MB/50 MB\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   98.250      1 -total\n 69.47%   68.258      3 Template:Ambox\n 57.61%   56.600      1 Template:Multiple_issues\n 42.31%   41.569      1 Template:Infobox_institute\n 37.12%   36.472      1 Template:Infobox\n 20.03%   19.675      1 Template:COI\n  6.82%    6.704      4 Template:If_empty\n  6.27%    6.160      1 Template:Comma_separated_entries\n  5.54%    5.444      1 Template:Unreferenced\n  2.06%    2.028      1 Template:Template_other\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:12100912-0!canonical and timestamp 20180918193818 and revision id 793001721\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"Columbia Center For New Media Teaching And Learning","hidden":"","*":"Wikipedia_articles_with_possible_conflicts_of_interest_from_August_2010"},{"sortkey":"Columbia Center For New Media Teaching And Learning","hidden":"","*":"Articles_lacking_sources_from_January_2011"},{"sortkey":"Columbia Center For New Media Teaching And Learning","hidden":"","*":"All_articles_lacking_sources"},{"sortkey":"Columbia Center For New Media Teaching And Learning","hidden":"","*":"Articles_with_multiple_maintenance_issues"},{"sortkey":"Columbia Center For New Media Teaching And Learning","*":"Columbia_University"},{"sortkey":"Columbia Center For New Media Teaching And Learning","*":"Educational_technology_research_centers"},{"sortkey":"Columbia Center For New Media Teaching And Learning","*":"1999_establishments_in_New_York_(state)"}],"links":[{"ns":14,"exists":"","*":"Category:Wikipedia articles with possible conflicts of interest from August 2010"},{"ns":14,"exists":"","*":"Category:Articles lacking sources from January 2011"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Center for Digital Research and Scholarship"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Columbia University"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Columbia University Library System"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Design Research"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Design research"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Frank Moretti"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"ITunes"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"James G.
