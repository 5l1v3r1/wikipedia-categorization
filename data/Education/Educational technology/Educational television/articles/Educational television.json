Some television programs are explicitly educational, while others only incidentally so. Some formats blend the two in the attempt to amuse but also retain some educational value.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"TV_reforms_for_education-based_programs\">TV reforms for education-based programs</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Educational_television&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: TV reforms for education-based programs\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In the time of <b>TV vs. Radio</b>, the early 1960s were an era of change. Historian Michael Curtin recounted that then-FCC-chair, Jon Doerfor and TV network heads, had come to an agreement that most of TV was based on commercialism and emphasized entertainment too much. To help counterbalance this, there was a plan organized to produce more serious news and documentary programs. This policy was placed just in time for networks to expand their news coverage on the Kennedy-Nixon campaigns and debates. This increase in coverage stirred up the polls as those who <i>saw</i> the debates, with Kennedy's good looks and camera confidence, decided he had won, whereas those who <i>listened</i> were more impressed with Nixon.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>By 1962, TV reform was in full swing, and 400 prime-time documentaries had been produced, as opposed to a total of zero back in 1957. Curtin noted that news programs were extended to full half-hour segments,and foreign and domestic issues were receiving heightened degrees of attention.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Edutainment_and_Telenovelas\">Edutainment and Telenovelas</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Educational_television&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Edutainment and Telenovelas\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Some television programs are designed with primarily educational purposes in mind, although they might rely heavily on entertainment to communicate their educational messages. In children's programing, <a href=\"/wiki/Edutainment\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Edutainment\">edutainment</a> becomes fun and interesting for the child but can still be educational.\n</p><p>Other television programs are designed to raise social awareness. One form of edutainment popular in Latin America is the educational <a href=\"/wiki/Telenovela\" title=\"Telenovela\">telenovela</a>. Miguel Sabido, a producer of telenovelas from the 1970s on, has combined communication theory with pro-health/education messages to educate audiences throughout <a href=\"/wiki/Latin_America\" title=\"Latin America\">Latin America</a> about family planning, literacy, and other topics. He developed a model which incorporated the work of <a href=\"/wiki/Albert_Bandura\" title=\"Albert Bandura\">Albert Bandura</a> and other theorists, as well as research to determine whether programs impacted audience behavior.\n</p><p>The first ever television series produced in the Pacific Island country of <a href=\"/wiki/Vanuatu\" title=\"Vanuatu\">Vanuatu</a>, entitled <i><a href=\"/wiki/Love_Patrol\" title=\"Love Patrol\">Love Patrol</a></i> and launched in 2007, was praised as an edutainment series, as it aimed to educate viewers on the issue of <a href=\"/wiki/AIDS\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"AIDS\">AIDS</a>, while simultaneously providing an entertaining story.<sup id=\"cite_ref-islandsbusiness1_7-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-islandsbusiness1-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The Hulu Original TV series <a href=\"/wiki/East_Los_High\" title=\"East Los High\">East Los High</a>, is backed by a health initiative to teach healthy sexual behaviors (e.g. using protection during sexual intercourse, getting checked for sexually transmitted diseases).<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Entertainment\">Entertainment</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Educational_television&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Entertainment\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Some television shows incorporate a considerable degree of historical or factual information while attempting to make the presentation or framing of such content entertaining or exciting. By making learning seem \"exciting\" they can be said to stimulate curiosity. The presence of edutainment is especially evident in <a href=\"/wiki/Children%27s_television_series\" title=\"Children&#39;s television series\">children's television series</a>, such as <i><a href=\"/wiki/Sesame_Street\" title=\"Sesame Street\">Sesame Street</a></i>, <i><a href=\"/wiki/Teletubbies\" title=\"Teletubbies\">Teletubbies</a></i>, and <i><a href=\"/wiki/Dora_The_Explorer\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Dora The Explorer\">Dora The Explorer</a></i>. Discovery Channel is also known for its various shows that follow that theme, including <i><a href=\"/wiki/MythBusters\" title=\"MythBusters\">MythBusters</a></i>. Sometimes these programs may be more entertaining than educational, and may replace educational shows in the televisions program lineup. The History Channel has transitioned from producing primarily factual and historical documentaries, to more sensational, dramatic, and supposedly entertaining programs, with educational content a secondary concern.\n</p><p>Television series notable for negative reception, from around the world, either by published critics, by network executives or by audience response, can be judged based on poor quality, the lack of a budget, rapid cancellation, very low viewership, offensive content, and/or negative impact on other series on the same channel. In some cases, a show that is acceptable on its own merits can be put in a position where it does not belong and be judged \"worst ever.\" In many cases, \"worst television series ever\" lists are slanted toward more contemporary shows, in recent memory.\n</p><p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Children%27s_Television_Act\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Children&#39;s Television Act\">Children's Television Act</a> of 1990, which was first fully enforced in 1996, requires  broadcast television stations in the United States to carry a minimum of three hours of \"<a href=\"/wiki/E/I\" title=\"E/I\">educational/informational</a>\" programming geared directly at children. The move prompted an exodus of non-educational children's programming to cable television and largely failed in its efforts to expand the amount of educational television on the airwaves (in fact, children's television in general has declined significantly on broadcast television since the act was imposed, although it can be argued that the E/I regulations could very well be the <i>only</i> thing keeping children's television on broadcast airwaves in the 2010s).\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Incidental_educational_value\">Incidental educational value</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Educational_television&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Incidental educational value\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Some programs are primarily aimed at entertainment, but may contain an incidental amount of educational content. Educational content may be inherent to the design of the show, such as with medical dramas where the plot invariably explores anatomical and biological issues. The <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Sentinel_Award&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Sentinel Award (page does not exist)\">Sentinel Award</a>, which is administered by the <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_Southern_California\" title=\"University of Southern California\">University of Southern California</a>'s <a href=\"/wiki/Annenberg_Center_for_Communication\" title=\"Annenberg Center for Communication\">Annenberg Center for Communication</a>, the <a href=\"/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention\" title=\"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\">CDC</a> and the <a href=\"/wiki/National_Cancer_Institute\" title=\"National Cancer Institute\">National Cancer Institute</a> (<a href=\"/wiki/National_Cancer_Institute\" title=\"National Cancer Institute\">NCI</a>), is given each year to programs that address health and medical issues in their storylines.  2006's nominees/winners include:\n</p>\n<ul><li><i><a href=\"/wiki/Numb3rs\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Numb3rs\">Numb3rs</a></i> - for a storyline about fighting crime using mathematics.</li>\n<li><i><a href=\"/wiki/Grey%27s_Anatomy\" title=\"Grey&#39;s Anatomy\">Grey's Anatomy</a></i> - for story lines about organ transplantation and cancer.</li>\n<li><i><a href=\"/wiki/As_the_World_Turns\" title=\"As the World Turns\">As the World Turns</a></i> - for a breast cancer storyline that involved a major character.</li>\n<li><i><a href=\"/wiki/George_Lopez_(TV_series)\" title=\"George Lopez (TV series)\">George Lopez</a></i> - for a storyline about a kidney transplant.</li>\n<li><i><a href=\"/wiki/Ben_%26_Izzy\" title=\"Ben &amp; Izzy\">Ben &amp; Izzy</a></i> - for a storyline about two children, Ben from America and Izzy from Jordan, who form a close bond despite their different cultural backgrounds.</li></ul>\n<p>While some programs are typically \"pure\" entertainment, they may foray into educational content at select times. For older viewers, individual <a href=\"/wiki/Situation_comedy\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Situation comedy\">situation comedy</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Episode\" title=\"Episode\">episodes</a> also occasionally serve as educational entertainment vehicles. These episodes are sometimes described in United States <a href=\"/wiki/Television_commercial\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Television commercial\">television commercial</a> parlance as <a href=\"/wiki/Very_special_episode\" title=\"Very special episode\">very special episodes</a>. The American <a href=\"/wiki/Situation_comedy\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Situation comedy\">sitcom</a> <i><a href=\"/wiki/Happy_Days\" title=\"Happy Days\">Happy Days</a></i> produced an especially effective edutainment episode which was reported to have prompted a 600% increase in the U.S. demand for library cards. As early as the 1950s, children-aimed shows like \"Watch Mr Wizard\" were made which could be considered edutainment.\n</p><p>On the other hand, some programs may seem for the lay public to contain educational content, but are actually completely fictional. It is up to experts to figure out if a specific TV program uses realistic or fictional plots. One example for only seemingly real programs are <a href=\"/wiki/Mockumentary\" title=\"Mockumentary\">mockumentaries</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Educational_television&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Cable_in_the_Classroom\" title=\"Cable in the Classroom\">Cable in the Classroom</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Educational_film\" title=\"Educational film\">Educational film</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/National_Association_of_Educational_Broadcasters\" title=\"National Association of Educational Broadcasters\">National Association of Educational Broadcasters</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Non-commercial_educational\" title=\"Non-commercial educational\">Non-commercial educational</a> (NCE)</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Educational_television&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist columns references-column-width\" style=\"-moz-column-width: 30em; -webkit-column-width: 30em; column-width: 30em; list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><cite class=\"citation web\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20060203124845/http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/parents/television/good_things_tv.cfm\">\"Archived copy\"</a>.
