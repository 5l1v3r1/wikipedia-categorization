The International Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics (IOAA) is an annual astronomy and astrophysics competition for high school students. It is one of the international science olympiads.  The Olympiad was founded from a dissidence inside the International Astronomy Olympiad, in order to increase the scope of the organization. The first IOAA was held in Chiang Mai, Thailand, in November/December 2007. The subsequent annual meetings were held in Indonesia (2008), Iran (2009), China (2010), Poland (2011), Brazil (2012), Greece (2013), Romania (2014), Indonesia (2015), India (2016), and in Phuket, Thailand (2017).  The upcoming 12th IOAA will be held in Beijing, China.  The following table lists multiple (triple and more) gold medal winners of IOAA with their ranks and corresponding years. Note: Several countries (e.g. India, Indonesia, Iran, Thailand) do not allow their students to contest in IOAA more than two times, even if they are eligible. Thus, statistics from those countries is not included in the table above.
