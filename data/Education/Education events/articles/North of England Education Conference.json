Whilst still having education at its core, a broader children\u2019s agenda was embraced.

The conference was often used as a platform to launch or 'sound out' changes in policy or legislation.

In 2004 the NEEC was held in <a href=\"/wiki/Northern_Ireland\" title=\"Northern Ireland\">Northern Ireland</a> in <a href=\"/wiki/Belfast\" title=\"Belfast\">Belfast</a> and in 2008, the NEEC paid its first visit to <a href=\"/wiki/Wales\" title=\"Wales\">Wales</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Cardiff\" title=\"Cardiff\">Cardiff</a>.

However the event, which generations of education policymakers viewed as a key moment of the year, now appears to be a thing of the past and by the time Michael Gove took over as education secretary in 2010, it was an event he was quite happy to miss, choosing to make major announcements elsewhere.

This is defined as <i>\"Those English Local Authorities within the Government Office areas for the North West, the North East and Yorkshire and the Humber, and also the higher education institutions lying in this area\".</i> Representatives from the host authority, their predecessor and the following years host were represented in the governance.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Involvement_of_children_and_young_people\">Involvement of children and young people</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=North_of_England_Education_Conference&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Involvement of children and young people\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>A strong feature of the conference is the involvement of children and young people. Traditionally involved in artistic, musical and dramatic performance they had begun to play a wider role in the content of the programme. In January 2012 Blackpool had a young person co-preside over the conference for the first time along with President, <a href=\"/wiki/Ann_Widdecombe\" title=\"Ann Widdecombe\">Ann Widdecombe</a>. In <a href=\"/wiki/Nottingham\" title=\"Nottingham\">Nottingham</a> in 2014 there was a separate Youth Conference running alongside the main event run by young people from the eight Core Cities.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"History_of_the_Conference\">History of the Conference</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=North_of_England_Education_Conference&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: History of the Conference\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In 1902, having seen the success of a conference for science teachers in London,  JH Reynolds, Manchester City Council's Director of Technical Instruction, decided to replicate the conference in his home town. The conference, also with a science theme, was arranged for 2 and 3 January 1903 and attended by 3,200 teachers, lecturers, inspectors and local government employees.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> Built on this success the conference widened the agenda to cover all areas of the curriculum. With short input from a range of professionals the, conference has remained true to the original template and remained a fixture in the first week of the year.\n</p><p>In 1924 the political dimension was added and the Secretary of the State of the day has usually been in attendance ever since, the conference often serving as a platform for announcement to changes in legislation or educational approaches.
