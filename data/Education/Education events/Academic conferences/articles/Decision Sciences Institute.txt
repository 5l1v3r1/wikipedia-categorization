 The Decision Sciences Institute (DSI) is a professional association of university professors, graduate students, and practitioners whose interest lies in the application of quantitative research and qualitative research to the decision problems of individuals, organizations, and society. Many of the members of this academic organization are faculty members in business schools.  Members of the Institute share their research findings at DSI's Annual Meeting (DSI's main academic conference), international DSI meetings, or regional conferences. The Decision Sciences Institute also publishes two journals and hosts annual award competitions for contributions to innovation education, the best case study, and best doctoral dissertation. In addition, the Institute offers job placement services, doctoral student and new faculty consortia, and a variety of professional development activities. The Decision Sciences Institute publishes two academic journals, Decision Sciences (journal) and Decision Sciences Journal of Innovative Education. Both journals are printed and distributed by Wiley-Blackwell and have subscriptions totaling over 5,000. In addition, the publication Decision Line, includes a wide range of practical and educational feature columns (international studies, ecommerce, academic research, production/operations management issues, information technology, doctoral studies, and classroom instruction), as well as news items that inform the membership of past, present, and future events. There are currently eight (8) regions. There are five regions in the United States and three (4) outside the U.S. (Europe, Mexico, Asia-Pacific, and the Indian subcontinent). The regions operate independently within the Institute. Each region elects its own officers and one representative who serves on the Institute’s Board of Directors.  DSI's home office is located in Atlanta, Georgia, where it receives support from the J. Mack Robinson College of Business at Georgia State University. Dennis E. Grawoig founded the organization in 1968 and served as its first president for two years and as its executive director until 1986. The Executive Director of the Institute from 1986 until her untimely death on June 3, 2013 was Carol J. Latta. As of April 19, 2014 DSI, was moved from the GSU campus to the University of Houston. In November 1968, a small group of faculty members met in Atlanta, Georgia to propose an academic society that would encourage interdisciplinary (now cross-disciplinary) participation in the new field of decision sciences.   The first annual meeting of the American Institute for Decision Sciences (AIDS) was held in New Orleans in 1969. About 100 charter members were in attendance.  The Institute's first journal, Decision Sciences, was first published in 1970. In 2003, DSI began publishing a second journal, the Decision Sciences Journal of Innovative Education (DSJIE). DSJIE publishes research on teaching and learning issues. In 1986, the name of the organization was changed to the Decision Sciences Institute "once the name AIDS became linked in the public's mind with a newly emerging disease."   Since 1986, Carol Latta has served as the Institute's Executive Director. She was made a Fellow of DSI in 2003.    DSI is one of a handful of organizations that address solving real-world business problems. One way in which DSI distinguishes itself from similar organizations is in addressing educational issues including curriculum, pedagogy, and careers.   Attendance at the Annual Meetings is now in the range of 1300 to 1400 attendees. The Institute is an independent non-profit educational organization. In order to further research in the decision sciences, the membership of the Decision Sciences Institute has been asked to participate in studies and surveys  and the research papers published in DSI conference proceedings have been studied.    In March 2008, the Decision Sciences Institute Wikipedia entry was developed.   The honor of Fellow is occasionally awarded to DSI members for outstanding contributions in the field of decision sciences in at least two (2) of the following: research and scholarship, teaching and/or administration, and service to the Decision Sciences Institute.
