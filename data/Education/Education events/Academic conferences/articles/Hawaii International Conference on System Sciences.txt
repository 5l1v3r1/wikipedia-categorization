The Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS) is an annual conference for Information Systems and Information Technology academics and professionals sponsored by the University of Hawaii at Manoa. Along with  ICIS, HICSS is widely considered to be one of the prestigious international conferences for IS/IT in the world.  The conference, which now draws over 1,000 participants every year, provides a platform for panel discussions and the presentation of peer-reviewed information systems research papers. Papers selected for presentation appear in the HICSS Proceedings published by IEEE, which have grown to add nearly 6,000 additional pages of refereed material annually. In addition, the Symposia, Workshops, and Tutorials held on the first day are a program component that specifically contributes to the quality of the conference.  The first HICSS conference, which took place in 1968 at the University of Hawaii, attracted representatives from 11 countries. Since that time, HICSS has grown markedly, and now attracts registered delegates from over four dozen countries every year. The conference is currently sponsored by the Shidler College of Business at the University of Hawai ªi-Manoa.  HICSS is the top IS conference in terms of citations as recorded by Google Scholar. The acceptance rate was less than 50% in 2015. Opportunities to fast track HICSS papers for journal publications are also available in some areas of research. Examples of journal publications that provide fast track opportunities to selected HICSS-50 papers include: Past  and future  HICSS conferences include:
