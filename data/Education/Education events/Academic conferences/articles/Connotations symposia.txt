The Connotations symposia are held biennially by the Connotations Society for Critical Debate. The first symposium sponsored by the Connotations Society was held in 1990.  The emphasis of the Connotations symposia is on critical debate. Participants from all over the world deliver papers on literature from the Middle English period to the present, as well as American and other literatures in English. Talks are 30 minutes, leaving another 30 minutes for discussion. Revised versions of conference papers are published in Connotations: A Journal for Critical Debate.  The 13th International Connotations-Symposium Poetic Justice: Legal, Ethical, and Aesthetic Judgments in Literary Texts took place in 2015 at Schloss Hohentübingen (de), Germany.
