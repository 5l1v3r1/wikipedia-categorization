The International Democratic Education Conference, or IDEC, is an annual academic and youth conference hosted by a variety of schools and organizations in cities around the world. IDEC was first held in 1993, and has been held in all subsequent years except for 2001 (see notes). The length of the conferences has varied between two days for the first event and 15 days in 1997. The purpose of each conference has been decided by the school that is organising it. Institute of Democratic Education Notes:
