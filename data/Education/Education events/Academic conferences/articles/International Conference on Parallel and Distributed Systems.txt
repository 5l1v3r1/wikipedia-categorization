The ICPADS was an international conference launched in 1992 by the computer science and engineering community in Taiwan in cooperation with the Technical Committee on Parallel Processing (TCPP) and Technical Committee on Distributed Processing (TCDP) of the IEEE Computer Society. Later it was sponsored by computer communities in Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea and held the conference annually in these countries. Since 1998, the ICPADS has been sponsored by the TCPP and TCDP of the IEEE Computer Society. ICPADS 2004 is the first ICPADS held outside the East Asia region.
