The  International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering (IEEE ISSRE) is an academic conference with  strong industry participation running since 1990   and covering reliability engineering for software. The first meeting was organized at Washington DC. IN addition to cities in USA, it has also been held in Paderborn, Germany, Hong Kong, Saint Malo, Bretagne, France, Trollhattan, Sweden, Mysuru, India, Hiroshima, Japan, Naples, Italy and Ottawa, Canada and Toulouse, France.
