EDU Ecosystem (dba LiveEdu) is a decentralized learning ecosystem that teaches people how to build complete products in future technological fields.      LiveEdu focuses on intermediate and expert learners who learn by watching how peers build real projects.   It also operates as an app blockchain company which uses ERC20 smart contracts.  In Jan 2018, LiveEdu launched an ICO to build new projects on its platform that is available for transactions with education coin (EDU).    LiveEdu was originally founded by Jamie Green & Dr. Michael J. Garbade in 2014 under the name Livecoding.tv.  The idea behind LiveEdu was inspired by Michael playing games on Twitch.tv and developing software in a Linux virtualbox environment. They came up with a question "what if there was a livestreaming platform like Twitch.tv but solely for software engineers to share code, exchange experiences, socialize and take their coding to the next level".  The platform became an educational live streaming site where people code products live in C/C++, C#/.Net, Java, Python, PHP, Javascript, Ruby, iOS/Objective C, and other programming languages.    LiveEdu received its first round of funding from EU Accelerator EuropeanPioneers and in 2015 it joined startup accelerator Y Combinator. The company garnered media attention after its launch, including mentions in TechCrunch,  CNN Money,  Mashable,  and others. In 2017, the company rebranded itself as EDU Ecosystem, expanded their content topics and shifted to focus on monetizable projects.    LiveEdu announced an initial coin offering starting on Jan. 15th 2018 with a goal of using proceeds to build 10,000 projects in different languages - English, Chinese, Russian, and Portuguese- for the platform.    The education coin (EDU) is integrated into all core modules and transactions on LiveEdu including payment for all financial transactions; reward project creators, learners, site moderators, and API ecosystem developers.  LiveEdu is a decentralized learning ecosystem for online education and professional development that teaches people how to build complete products in future technological fields and to improve their job skills..    Their ecosystem focuses on the intermediate to expert educational levels in eight main topics including artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, game development, data science, cryptocurrencies, programming, design, and augmented and virtual reality.  Project creators build practical projects that help learners to become proficient in the creation of real products. Learners and project creators are able to interact with each other directly and in real time to discuss projects.
