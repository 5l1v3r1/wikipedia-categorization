The site was funded by the Young Foundation, amongst others, and won a UK Catalyst award for the social use of technology   and a New Statesman New Media Award 2008.  In 2010, School of Everything was chosen by Becta and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills as its new platform for adult informal learning in the UK.  Via the website, learners are able to search for teachers in their area, and, similarly teachers can search for learners. Registration is free, with the site catering for teachers who charge for their lessons as well as those who offer lessons for free, or as part of a skill swap.
