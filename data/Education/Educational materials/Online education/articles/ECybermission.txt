 eCybermission (stylized as eCYBERMISSION) is a U.S. Army-sponsored online educational science fair for students in grades 6-9 in the United States or at US Army schools across the world.  The contest is conducted entirely onlineâ€”groups of 3-4 students submit "Mission Folders", which contain detailed information about their projects choosing either Scientific Inquiry or the Engineering Design Process. The competition selects winners on state, regional, and finally national levels for each grade level. All regional winners receive a one-week trip to the Washington, DC area to attend the National Judging and Educational Event (NJ&EE). Students can win up to $9,000 in savings bonds (maturity value).  The NJ&EE event includes many opportunities to meet others, physical training, various workshops and panels, as well as the STEM Challenge, which is a day working with scientists and engineers from different sectors of RDECOM, the department of the Army that oversees the events. eCYBERMISSION is part of the Army Educational Outreach Program (AEOP). The competition is administered by the National Science Teachers Association (NSTA).
