France université numérique (FUN) is the French national platform to promote the use of massive open online courses (MOOCs).  The portal is supported by the American open edX open source platform, and supported by Google since September 2013. The audiovisual content is hosted on Amazon  Web Services servers.  At its launch, the platform was endowed by the government, a budget of eight million euros.   There are 39 categories available on the platform. A MOOC may overlap multiple categories.
