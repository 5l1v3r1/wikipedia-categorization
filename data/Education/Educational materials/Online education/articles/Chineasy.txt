Chineasy is an Internet startup created with the purpose of teaching characters, created by the entrepreneur Shaolan Hsueh.  For visual learners the human brain is able to memorize information better if it is put into a visual context. The approach is to learn Chinese characters with the help of illustrations to help memorizing Chinese characters better. The 2014 book Chineasy: The New Way to Read Chinese contains about 400 characters.   It was based on her 2013 TED talk   and funded via a crowdfunding campaign through Kickstarter.  While the book introduces common Chinese characters, it does not teach pronunciation or grammar, and thus does not teach how to read or use the language.Although it does use voice recordings for the users to mimic.  Chineasy teaches sometimes traditional and sometimes simplified forms. Hsueh argued that traditional and simplified forms of Chinese still share a great number of characters, and in real life – just as in the case of British English and American English – you will come across both forms. Where they differ, she shows the other version as well.  Chineasy has been widely featured in the press, including the Financial Times,   the Wall Street Journal,  Time magazine,  and National Public Radio.  It won Wallpaper’s 2014 Design Award.  Hsueh's book uses illustrations and storytelling.  Characters are illustrated by various illustrators including Noma Bar.
