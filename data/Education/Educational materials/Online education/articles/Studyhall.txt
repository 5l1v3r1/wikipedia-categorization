Studyhall.com accounts have a word processing feature for members to record, share, and organize class notes. Each accounts has video-chat capability for interactive study sessions, in which notes can be shared between two members on a collaborative “whiteboard.”  Studyhall.com officially launched in September 2012 at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference in San Francisco, where the company was a Startup Battlefield Finalist.
