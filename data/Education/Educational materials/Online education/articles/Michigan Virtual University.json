MVS works in cooperation with individual school districts to grant course credit and diplomas. Through MVS, Michigan high school and middle school students can take a variety of courses and learn any place there is a computer and an Internet connection.\n</p><p>As one of the largest virtual schools in the U.S., Michigan Virtual School offers more than 150 online courses, including unique courses like Chinese and <i>CareerForward</i>, an online career exploration course.\n</p><p><b>Michigan LearnPort:</b>\nMichigan LearnPort was established by the State of Michigan in partnership with the Michigan Department of Education.
