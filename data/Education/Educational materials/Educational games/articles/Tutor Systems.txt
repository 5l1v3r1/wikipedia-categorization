Tutor Systems is an Australian ludic learning tool that allows learners to check their answers for accuracy themselves. There are different sets of tasks, from pre-school to grammar school. This is the English adaptation of German-speaking LÜK, of which LÜK means "lernen, üben, kontrollieren" (learn, practice, check). This learning tool was invented in the 1960s by the German Heinz Vogel (1919-1980) and is still used successfully today at home, in nursery, primary and secondary schools. Australia  and New Zealand, Tutor Systems has been published since the 1970s  and also exported to Malaysia  and Japan.    There are versions in 18 languages distributed in 35 countries, including Veritech in France and Canada, LÜK in German-speaking countries, YUP in Turkey, LYCK in Sweden and ARCO in Venezuela.  It is produced by Modern Teaching Aid under licence of the Westermann Verlag. The set consists of a workbook, a flat red box ("Tutor plastic tray") with small depressions and a number of tiles that fit into the depressions and are printed on both sides - on the front with a number, on the back with the part of a motif. The objective is to solve a set of tasks from the workbook and insert the tiles into the tray according to the results. The tray is then closed, turned over and re-opened - comparing the pattern on the back of the tiles and the printed drawing in the workbook, students see if all the tasks have been solved correctly. Already in the first year, more than 15 000 trays were sold. Today about 600 different workbooks are available and cover all school branches.  Tutor Systems is often used like other classical self-control learning devices in the context of individual work.  It is used mostly in pre-schools and primary schools, but also in grammar schools  and at university to obtain a more sustainable learning success.
