Amazing Alex was a physics-based puzzle game created by Rovio Entertainment,  the developer of popular multiplatform strategy puzzle video game Angry Birds. Initially it was announced by Rovio's CEO Mikael Hed on Yle's breakfast television.  The game was based on Casey's Contraptions, a game created by Noel Llopis (Snappy Touch) and Miguel √Ångel Friginal (Mystery Coconut), whose rights were acquired by Rovio.   The game featured educational elements and revolved around Alex, described as a curious boy with interest in building things.  The goal of the game was to make various Rube Goldberg-type chain reaction machines work. The game was very similar to The Incredible Machine, originally released in 1993. On April 13, 2015, the game was removed from the App Store and Google Play. For this game, players would put the given object to the place where players must put to it. In "Levels of the Week", "Downloaded Levels" and "My Levels", the game was automatically completed when you collected all 3 stars. Harry Slater of Pocket Gamer gave the game a Bronze Award, and called it an "addictive experience" but that "compared to Angry Birds, there's less excitement involved".
