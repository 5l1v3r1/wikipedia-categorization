The first phase was undertaken by the Glenn L.

The plane was equipped to receive a relay transmission from <a href=\"/wiki/WMAR-TV\" title=\"WMAR-TV\">WMAR-TV</a> in Baltimore, which was then relayed over a 5&#160;kW video transmitter and a 1&#160;kW audio transmitter for reception on 82-88&#160;MHz with a television set tuned to Channel 6.\n</p><p>The aircraft received its originating signals from circular dipoles attached to a streamlined eight-foot (2.5&#160;m) mast on top of the aircraft's vertical tail fin. The retractable 28 feet (8.5&#160;m) long broadcasting antenna hung vertically beneath the aircraft. It was composed of a two-element turnstile array for video and a single-element circular dipole for sound transmissions.\n</p><p>The receivers, transmitters and necessary air-conditioning were all powered by the plane's engines using three 15&#160;kVA, 500&#160;Hz alternators. Without air conditioning the transmitters in the interior of the aircraft would have generated a temperature of 134 degrees Fahrenheit (57 degrees Celsius) with an outside air temperature of 25 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 4 degrees Celsius).\n</p><p>On 23 June 1948 the system's airborne transmitter rebroadcast the <a href=\"/wiki/Republican_National_Convention\" title=\"Republican National Convention\">Republican National Convention</a>, being held in <a href=\"/wiki/Philadelphia,_Pennsylvania\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\">Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</a>, to the surrounding nine-state area during the 9 to 10 pm <a href=\"/wiki/Eastern_Time_Zone_(North_America)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Eastern Time Zone (North America)\">EDT</a> time period.

From these reports it was calculated that Stratovision would require only eight relay planes to provide a transcontinental network and six additional planes to provide coverage to 78 percent of the United States. Mr. Charles Edward Nobles who was the head of Stratovision for Westinghouse said in his report:\n</p>\n<dl><dd>\"<i>The major technical problems of the system have been solved, and the commercial development awaits only the crystallization of public demand for the expanded services offered by airborne broadcasting, application of the system by the radio industry to meet this demand, and the clarification of channel facilities available to make possible this application.</i>\"</dd></dl>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Education_by_Stratovision\">Education by Stratovision</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Stratovision&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Education by Stratovision\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In 1961 a nonprofit organization, <a href=\"/wiki/Midwest_Program_on_Airborne_Television_Instruction\" title=\"Midwest Program on Airborne Television Instruction\">Midwest Program on Airborne Television Instruction</a>, commenced a Stratovision service from the airfield of Purdue University.

The aircraft were equipped with two 2-inch (51&#160;mm) videotape machines and two UHF transmitters.\n</p><p>When MPATI signed on it used an <a href=\"/wiki/Indian_Head_test_card\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Indian Head test card\">\"Indian head\" test pattern card</a> which was shown for five minutes before and between programs.

AID was also spending $2.4 million to supply a total of 2,500 TV sets to South Vietnam.\n</p><p>The entire project was under the control of Captain George C. Dixon, USN. He claimed to be installing AM, FM, shortwave and TV transmitters on the aircraft which would get their power from an onboard 100&#160;kW diesel-fueled generator.
