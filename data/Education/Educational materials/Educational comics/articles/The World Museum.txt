 The World Museum was a full-page illustrated feature in some American Sunday newspapers, starting in June 1937 until January 1938. Devised and drawn by Holling Clancy Holling (1900â€“1973), it was also known as The World Museum Dioramas.  The Evening Star in Washington and the Baltimore American both published the dioramas.   Publication in the Evening Star abruptly stops in February 1938 in spit of the next diorama, Log Cabin Days and scheduled for February 6, 1938 being announced in the January 30, 1938 issue along with Roman Gladiators. No announcement of the cancellation seems to have been done.   Each diorama was published in the Sunday edition and occupied a full page in color. It featured all the parts to be cut out by the reader with detailed instructions to cut out the pictures and assemble them into a diorama using wrapping paper to stiffen the strucutre. Each new diorama had a paragraph explaining the diorama itself from a historical or geographical point of view.
