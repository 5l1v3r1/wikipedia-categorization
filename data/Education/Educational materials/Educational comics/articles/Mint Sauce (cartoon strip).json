Sugworth, better known to friends and foe alike as 'Mint Sauce', is a <a href=\"/wiki/Mountain_biking\" title=\"Mountain biking\">mountain biking</a> sheep with a philosophical, often poetic outlook, who enjoys biking jaunts through the British countryside with his fellow animal cyclists. Indeed, in many strips it is the countryside which plays the leading role, often reducing the \"leading\" characters to mere counterpoint to the main theme. Burt's portrayal of landscape is heavily centred on an imagined England, incorporating elements of many southern English areas - principally the <a href=\"/wiki/Sussex\" title=\"Sussex\">Sussex</a>/<a href=\"/wiki/Wessex\" title=\"Wessex\">Wessex</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Downland\" title=\"Downland\">Downs</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Mendip_Hills\" title=\"Mendip Hills\">Mendip</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Chiltern_Hills\" title=\"Chiltern Hills\">Chiltern Hills</a>, although forays are sometimes made into more northerly ranges. Reading the cartoons one can't help but feel that, for Mint, revelling in the countryside is at least as important as riding the bike.\n</p><p>Other characters featuring in the strip include Cattlegrid Coleman the Cow, Harrison the Rabbit, Oonagh Herwick (Mint's girlfriend), an anthropomorphic personification of Summer, Chipko Andolan and Death. Minor character appearances are made by a number of hills (The Mendip Brothers, a Cheviot etc.), elves (who alter trails to fox riders, not to be confused with trail pixies who build and improve trails), various squadrons of fighting aircraft (the best known of which is the Love Squadron, a collection of WW2 era propeller planes and biplanes, often seen in battle with more advanced jets, known as the Reality Squadron) and even the occasional human, who generally have negative roles.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"History_and_impact\">History and impact</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Mint_Sauce_(cartoon_strip)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: History and impact\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The Mint Sauce strip first appeared in <i>Bicycle Action</i> in March 1988 and moved to <i><a href=\"/wiki/MBUK\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"MBUK\">MBUK</a></i> about eighteen months later. Drawn in black and white half-page format it later became larger and moved to full colour as his popularity increased. As well as the cartoon strip there have been <i>Mint Sauce</i> calendars, T-shirts, stickers, posters, key-fobs and cycling jerseys, though Jo Burt's busy workload means that delivery times for these can be protracted.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"External_links\">External links</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Mint_Sauce_(cartoon_strip)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: External links\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.thisiswhy.co.uk/\">A history and online archive of Mint Sauce</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.bikereader.com/contributors/burt/burt.html\">Burt's contributions to bikereader.com</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.mbuk.com\">MBUK Magazine homepage</a></li></ul>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw1319\nCached time: 20180904135450\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.004 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.010 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 17/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 0/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:2484840-0!canonical and timestamp 20180904135450 and revision id 844731338\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","*":"British_comic_strips"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Mountain_biking_magazines"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Fictional_sheep"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Fictional_bikers"},{"sortkey":"","*":"1988_comics_debuts"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Comics_characters_introduced_in_1988"},{"sortkey":"","*":"British_comics_characters"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Comics_featuring_anthropomorphic_characters"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Educational_comics"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Cycling_comics"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Chiltern Hills"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Downland"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"MBUK"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Mendip Hills"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Mountain biking"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Sussex"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Wessex"}],"templates":[],"images":[],"externallinks":["http://www.thisiswhy.co.uk/","http://www.bikereader.com/contributors/burt/burt.html","http://www.mbuk.com"],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Concept","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Mint_Sauce_(cartoon_strip)","byteoffset":185,"anchor":"Concept"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"History and impact","number":"2","index":"2","fromtitle":"Mint_Sauce_(cartoon_strip)","byteoffset":1721,"anchor":"History_and_impact"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"External links","number":"3","index":"3","fromtitle":"Mint_Sauce_(cartoon_strip)","byteoffset":2208,"anchor":"External_links"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Mint Sauce (cartoon strip)","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q6869572"}]}}
