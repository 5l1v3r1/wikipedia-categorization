Strip AIDS and Strip AIDS U.S.A. are comics anthology volumes published in 1987 in the UK, and 1988 in the US (respectively). They combined short comics with educational and sometimes comedic themes, to educate readers about HIV disease and safer sex, and to raise funds for the care of people with AIDS. Strip AIDS was edited by Don Melia, and published by Willyprods/Small Time Ink. Proceeds of the project went to London Lighthouse.  It was 56 pages. The book was released in conjunction with an art exhibition in London, which brought the number of artists involved to nearly 90.  Contributors include Steven Appleby, Bill Belcher, Steve Bell, Mark Buckingham, Daniel Clowes, Richard Coles, Alan Davis, Kim Deitch, Frank Dickens, Hunt Emerson, Melinda Gebbie, Dave Gibbons, David Hine, Rian Hughes, Gray Joliffe, Raymond Jackson, Jay Lynch, Peter Milligan, Alan Moore, Kevin O'Neill, Bill Sienkiewicz, Posy Simmonds, Richard Starkings, and Skip Williamson.   The development of Strip AIDS U.S.A. was inspired by Strip AIDS.   It was initiated by Trina Robbins, who co-edited it with Bill Sienkiewicz and Robert Triptow.   It was published by Last Gasp. Proceeds from the sale of the book went to the Shanti Project, a San-Francisco-based agency serving people with AIDS.  It was 136 pages.   The contributors were a mixture of mainstream superhero comics creators,  influential independent cartoonists, and lesser-known lesbian and gay cartoonists, and consisted of what one reviewer called "one of the most impressive lineups of talent I've ever seen".  They include Sergio Aragon√©s, Tim Barela, Alison Bechdel, Bob Boze Bell, Angela Bocage, Howard Cruse, Nicole Hollander, Kathryn LeMieux, Frank Miller, Harvey Pekar, Garry Trudeau, Jules Feiffer, Will Eisner, Arn Saba, Los Bros Hernandez, Reed Waller and Kate Worley, and Tom Yeates.
