They can be complemented by other learning technologies such as a learning management system,  and are part of the educational technology ecosystem.  A TMS manages back-office processes for corporate instructor-led-training administration, and typically handles session registration, course administration, tracking, and reporting.    Somes TMSs also manage financials aspects, including budget forecasting and cost-tracking.   TMSs are often used by regulated industries for compliance training.  TMSs can be complemented by other learning technologies such as a learning management system for e-learning management and course delivery.    Most TMSs are web-based. TMSs were originally designed to be locally hosted on-premise, where the organization purchases a license to a version of the software, and installs it on their own servers and network. Many TMSs are also offered asÂ SaaS (software as a service), with hosting provided by the vendors.
