SITS:Vision, also known just as SITS, is a database application used for course and student management in further and higher education institutions, developed and maintained by the Tribal Group. It is currently used by roughly 70%  of the UK higher education sector as well as international institutions such as the University of Sydney and the University of Otago. SITS has been in existence since 1991 and was first developed by a former Registrar and IT Director of a UK university. The company, Strategic Information Technology Services, started in a residential property in Beverley, East Yorkshire before moving to commercial property in Middleton-on-the-Wolds. The business moved to Hessle, East Yorkshire, in 1997 and into the current premises in Hesslewood in 2000. SITS was acquired by Tribal Group PLC [TRB.L] in 2004. E:Vision (sometimes styled as eVision or e:Vision), is a web-based interface designed to interact with the SITS client. It was created with the intention of allowing users to design web-based interfaces for student and/or staff interaction. This has the advantage of allowing the user to circumvent the SITS client which some customers find cumbersome. E:Vision interfaces are created using the traditional SITS client, but does not come as a standard component when purchasing SITS. The two basic type of interfaces that can be created are 'tasks' and 'vistas' - the former allowing workflows to be created wherein a user might complete a process or operation, the latter offers an area in which data can be viewed and edited.
