Sclipo /ˈsklɪpoʊ/ was a Learning Management System, providing a fully hosted Online Campus solution with web applications that support face-to-face and distance education.  The project seems to have closed near the end of 2012. Founded by Gregor Gimmy, Sclipo was launched on October 20, 2006 (then called Visuarios), as a website to share user-generated educational videos. The initial product allowed professional and amateur teachers to share knowledge online through video, making Sclipo one of the first websites of user-generated educational videos.  Sclipo then recognized that independent teachers, small schools and companies in continuous education growingly used generic web applications for teaching such as Skype for live web classes and Slideshare to share documents. In addition, Sclipo saw that current learning management systems, such as Moodle or Blackboard, were too complex and expensive for a small, 1-15 teacher-sized, educational entity. Sclipo then decided to expand its offering and create a suite of web applications specifically for learning purposes and adapted to the needs of small educational entities in continuous education.    These were launched continuously, the first one being the Virtual Classroom (live teaching) application in September 2007.  Sclipo website went down about November 2012, and since then redirects to a Spanish informational web catalog. A Sclipo Online Campus provides synchronous and asynchronous web applications to learn, teach, socialize, administer, promote and sell face-to-face as well as online education services and content.
