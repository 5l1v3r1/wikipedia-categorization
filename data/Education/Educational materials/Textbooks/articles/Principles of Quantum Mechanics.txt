Principles of Quantum Mechanics is a textbook by Ramamurti Shankar.  The book has been through two editions. It is used in many college courses around the world.    Physics Bulletin said about the book, "No matter how gently one introduces students to the concept of Dirac’s bras and kets, many are turned off. Shankar attacks the problem head-on in the first chapter, and in a very informal style suggests that there is nothing to be frightened of". American Scientist called it "An excellent text … The postulates of quantum mechanics and the mathematical underpinnings are discussed in a clear, succinct manner".
