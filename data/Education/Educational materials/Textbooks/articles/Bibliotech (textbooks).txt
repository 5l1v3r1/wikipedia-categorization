Bibliotech is an education technology company. The company was founded in 2013,  with David Sherwood as its CEO,  who cofounded the company with Daniel Engelke, Tao Mantaras,  Ryan White and Ellis Gecan at the Oxford University Startup Incubator.  In 2017 the company was named to the FutureBook shortlist  and BusinessCloud’s rising start technology companies.  In 2018 the company received funding from the University of Oxford Innovation Fund III,  raising $4 million.  The company provides e-textbooks to students, negotiating with publishers of core book publishers to give access to students and academics at reduced prices in comparison to their normal purchase prices. Textbook packages are integrated into a school’s library management systems, and adjust packages according to a school’s reading lists.  The company also has a subscription service for university libraries to make textbook packages searchable in their databases.   The first field in which the company had a significant portion of the available textbooks for offer was Chemistry.
