Grok Learning is an online interactive platform that offers coding classes in programming languages like Python and HTML.  Grok Learning has a focus on educating high school students, but also has content targeted specifically for professionals.  Grok Learning provides courses suitable for use in a classroom setting where a computing trained teacher may or may not be present.  The site teaches students through a combination of notes and accompanying coding problems to solve. These problems can coded and run using the in-browser programming environment and are marked instantaneously by an auto-marker. The site offers feedback for solved problems, and badges for completing certain tasks, as well as leaderboards for certain courses. Grok Learning was founded in 2013 by Tara Murphy, James Curran, Tim Dawborn, and Nicky Ringland.  At the time of foundation, James was an associate professor in the School of IT at The University of Sydney,  Tara was a senior lecturer in astroinformatics at The University of Sydney,  and Tim and Nicky were computer science PhD candidates at The University of Sydney.   Since then, Tim and Nicky have completed their PhDs in 2015.
