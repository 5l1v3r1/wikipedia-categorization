The Millennium Mathematics Project (MMP) was set up within the University of Cambridge in England as a joint project between the Faculties of Mathematics and Education in 1999. The MMP aims to support maths education for pupils of all abilities from ages 5 to 19 and promote the development of mathematical skills and understanding, particularly through enrichment and extension activities beyond the school curriculum, and to enhance the mathematical understanding of the general public. The project is currently[when?] directed by John Barrow. The MMP includes a range of complementary programmes: The project has also developed a Hands On Maths Roadshow presenting creative methods of exploring mathematics, and in 2004 took on the running of Simon Singh's Enigma schools workshops, exploring maths through cryptography and codebreaking. Both are taken to primary and secondary schools and public venues such as shopping centres across the UK and Ireland. James Grime is the Enigma Project Officer and gives talks in schools and to the general public about the history and mathematics of code breaking - including the demonstration of a genuine World War II Enigma Machine. In November 2005, the MMP won the Queen's Anniversary Prize for Higher and Further Education.
