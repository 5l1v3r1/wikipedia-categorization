TESTfunda.com is a for-profit education website based in Mumbai, India. In 2008, four IIT and IIM alumni founded the website.  The website provides help to students, ranging from career counseling to preparation. It provides assistance for MBA, Bank & Govt. exam preparation for CAT, XAT, SNAP, IIFT, NMAT, CMAT, MH-CET, IBPS & SBI Clerk, IBPS & SBI PO. The company's student base contains fresher students as well as experienced professionals. Mocks & study materials are provided for students   in online, print & android app format. The website came into the limelight when it became the only website to provide online preparation material and practice tests, after it  was announced that the CAT would be a Computer Based Test. Various CAT coaching institutes across the country had then entered into a tie-up with the portal to provide computer-based testing services to their students.
