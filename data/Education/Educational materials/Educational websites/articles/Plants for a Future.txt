Plants For A Future (PFAF) is an online not for profit resource for those interested in edible and useful plants, with a focus on temperate regions. The project currently has a site in the South West of England where many of the plants are being grown on a trial basis, and maintains a small mail order catalogue. The organization's emphasis is on perennial plants. PFAF is a registered educational charity with strong ethical principals and the following objectives:  The Charityâ€™s objectives are to advance the education of the public by the promotion of all aspects of ecologically sustainable vegan-organic horticulture and agriculture with an emphasis on tree, shrub and other perennial species; and the undertaking of research into such horticulture and agriculture, and dissemination of the results of such research.  The website contains an online database of over 7000 plants that can be grown in the UK; the data is created/collated by Ken Fern, and can be either used online free of charge, or downloaded for a small sum.
