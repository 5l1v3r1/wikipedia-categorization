r/changemyview is an Internet forum on Reddit where the community of participants discuss various topics for the purpose of understanding opposing viewpoints. Users submit posts containing an opinion of theirs, and respondents to each post attempt to change the poster's views on that matter.  Submitters must reply to these challenges in three hours or less, resulting in debate over the topic. If their view is changed, they can award a delta symbol (âˆ†) to a commenter. The forum was established by Kal Turnbull, a Scottish musician,  in 2013; he was 17 years old at the time.  He came up with the idea after noticing that everyone in his friend group all shared similar views, leading him to wonder how one could easily come across opposing viewpoints. Conversations from the subreddit have been the subject of research on interaction dynamics.
