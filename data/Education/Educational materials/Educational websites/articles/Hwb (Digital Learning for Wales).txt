Hwb is a website and collection of online tools provided to all schools in Wales by the Welsh Government. It was created in response to the 'Find it, Make it, Use it, Share it' report  into Digital Learning in Wales. The main site (http://hwb.wales.gov.uk) contains over 88,000 bilingual resources that were transferred from NGfL Cymru. In addition teachers and learners with accounts can sign in and access a range of other online tools and resources. Included in this is a school specific Learning Platform (Hwb+).
