 Velferdsvillaen.org is a webpage created in 2006 by a group of Nordic youth, Nordisk Ungdomspanel, founded by Norway's formanship in the Nordic Council of Ministers, intended to educate Nordic teenagers about the welfare system in the Nordic Countries.  The webpage uses Flash to demonstrate a house, but each room contains facts about the Nordic Countries and interactive games and quizzes made to introduce the North in an interesting way. The Villa is a one floor house with a basement. The visitor is greeted by a so-called Welfare Ambassador, who invites the visitor to explore the rooms of the house.  The Ambassador then follows you around the house and points out interesting things. Each room often has a theme.  Here is a list of rooms and the main things inside them.
