MasterClass is a San Francisco-based online education platform. Students can access tutorials and lectures pre-recorded by experts in various fields. The concept was conceived by David Rogier and Aaron Rasmussen.  In addition to the video classes, class workbook and homework are also part of the course. In the case of actor Dustin Hoffman's course, the “interactive assignments” involved the student acting with other students, either in person or over Skype.  The general consensus among critics is that while the classes do not teach technical skills to improve proficiency in the craft, they provide insight into the grueling nature of artistic pursuits and striving for perfection while inspiring a love of the craft.       The Verge noted that while the subscriptions last a lifetime, each course has little replay value, and so it is challenging to keep the student learning within the platform once they have viewed the video classes.  Reviewopedia noted that while there are many educational tutorial platforms, this has a point of difference as having teachers that are worldwide recognised in their fields.  Deadline noted that the classes aren't interactive, which is a symptom of online courses in general.  Kevin Spacey's and Dustin Hoffman's acting courses were removed in late 2017 after multiple sexual assault allegations had come out against both actors.
