Edline is a Learning Community Management System that many schools use for school and class organization. It provides district, school and classroom level website support for administrators, parents, teachers and students from kindergarten through 12th grade. The firm's    website states that its service is used by schools in all 50 U.S. states and has been featured in publications such as Newsweek.   The firm has acquired the earlier-established competitive products of Jackson Software, the makers of GradeQuick, and Orbis Software, the makers of Easy Grade Pro.  Edline is used in many schools aiming to have paperless classes and homework, thereby cutting costs.  The instructor/teacher can upload such material as upcoming tests, projects, homework, class expectations, and progress reports. The website mainly helps parents see if students have missed any homework. Parents or students can even e-mail teachers if any kind of help is needed.   Different schools may upload varying amounts of data and information, depending on teacher preference and school requirements.   In 2009, Archipelago Learning acquired a minority interest in Edline as part of its acquisition by Providence Equity Partners.  In October 2011, Edline merged with Blackboard. In July 2012, Edline announced they are being rebranded as Blackboard Engage.  During the 2014-2015 school year, some school districts across the nation were starting to replace Edline with other similar tools like Google Classroom, Schoology, Skyward, PlusPortals, etc.
