Share My Lesson is a free teaching resources website with over 300,000 resources.  It officially launched on June 19, 2012. The American Federation of Teachers partnered with Britainâ€™s TES Connect with the aim of building the largest online community for US teachers to collaborate and share teaching resources and innovative ideas. There is a significant emphasis on resources to guide teachers on implementing the new Common Core State Standards. The announcement about Share My Lesson was made on June 19, 2012, at the Global Education Conference at Stanford University. The AFT and TES Global (the owners of the TES) are investing $10 million to develop the site.  Speaking at the launch, AFT president Randi Weingarten said that there was a need for quality, peer-assessed lesson plans that was not currently being met by other resource-sharing sites.  The site has received the support of Education Secretary Arne Duncan, who said that the program would benefit teachers everywhere. "We must support the incredibly complex work teachers do at every opportunity, including by sharing and promoting best practices through online resources and communities of practice," he said.  From the beginning, Share My Lesson has been committed to providing our community of members high-quality and effective lessons, useful information to use in the classroom and professional development. As of 2015, Share My Lesson has 900,000 members, more than 300k Toddler - Grade 12 resources which have been downloaded more than 10 million times.
