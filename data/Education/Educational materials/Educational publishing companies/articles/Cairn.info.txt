Cairn.info is a French-language web portal, founded in 2005, containing scholarly materials in the humanities and social sciences. Much of the collection is in French, but it also includes an English-language international interface to facilitate use by non-francophones. Primary research areas include communications, economics, education, geography, history, literature, linguistics, philosophy, political science, law, psychology, sociology, and cultural studies. The site provides gratis open access  to some publications. The site originated with materials from four major French and Belgian publishing houses: Éditions Belin (fr), De Boeck (fr), La Découverte and Éditions Érès (fr).  Bibliothèque nationale de France joined in 2006. It has since expanded to include publications from multiple other publishers, including extensive collections of French-language journals – 150,000 journal articles and 4000 books. The following list includes some examples of journals in Cairn.info:
