Macmillan Education is a publisher of English Language teaching and school curriculum materials. The company is based in London, UK, and operates in over 40 countries worldwide. In 1994, Simon & Schuster acquired the American branch of Macmillan Publishers. Four years later, Simon & Schuster divested its educational division, including the remains of Macmillan Education, to Pearson PLC.  On June 30, 1999, Pearson sold Macmillan's reference division to IDG for $83 million.  Until 2015, when it was merged into Springer Nature, Macmillan Education was a division of Macmillan Publishers Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Holtzbrinck Publishing Group.  In 2011 Macmillan Publishers Ltd was fined GBP 11.3 million by the High Court in London, in respect of gains through corruption by Macmillan Education in East and West Africa between 2002 and 2009.  Subsequently, Macmillan Education stopped operating in East and West Africa.
