Imagine is an educational periodical for 7th-12th graders and published by the Center for Talented Youth (CTY) at Johns Hopkins University. It is intended to provide intellectual stimulus for students looking toward their college years. Each issue focuses on an academic theme such as engineering, social sciences, archaeology, or robotics, that a younger student might not be exposed to in the course of primary or secondary education. The magazine also features, among other things, student-written articles (making up the bulk of the magazine) about summer and extracurricular activities, reviews of selective colleges, book reviews, interviews with accomplished people, puzzles, college planning advice, and career options information. Contests for Imagine readers are held at times, with topics ranging from essay competitions to photo contests. In 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007 Imagine was awarded the Parents' Choice Gold Award for magazines.  The editor is Melissa Hartman of Johns Hopkins University, CTY. The magazine is published five times each year. Issues are between 40 and 50 pages in length.
