The China Open Resources for Education, or  CORE, was a non-profit organization that promoted closer interaction and open sharing of educational resources between Chinese and international universities. Its website is offline since 2013.  CORE was established in November 2003 following an MIT OpenCourseWare Conference in Beijing. CORE was a consortium of universities that began with 26 IET Educational Foundation member universities and 44 China Radio and TV Universities, with a total enrollment of 5 million students. It aimed to provide Chinese universities with free and easy access to global open educational resources and provides the framework for Chinese-speaking universities to participate in the shared, global network of advanced courseware with MIT and other leading universities.
