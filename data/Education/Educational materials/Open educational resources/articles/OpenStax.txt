OpenStax (formerly OpenStax College) is a nonprofit ed-tech initiative based at Rice University. Since 2012, OpenStax has created peer-reviewed, openly licensed textbooks, which are available in free digital formats and for a low cost in print. Most books are also available in Kindle versions on Amazon.com and in the iBooks Store. OpenStax's first textbook was College Physics, which was published online, in print, and in iBooks in 2012. OpenStax has also launched OpenStax Tutor, an adaptive courseware based on cognitive science principles, machine learning, and OpenStax content. Aiming to compete with major publishers' offerings,   the project was initially funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, the Michelson 20MM Foundation, and the Maxfield Foundation.    All textbook content is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution Licenses; specifically, the books are available under the CC BY license (except for Calculus, which is CC BY-NC-SA), which means that instructors are free to use, adapt, and remix the content, as long as they attribute OpenStax. In 2017, OpenStax announced that they were partnering with UK Open Textbooks to spread the use of their open content in the UK , and partnering with Katalyst Education to form OpenStax Polska, bringing Polish-language versions of select OpenStax books to universities in Poland. OpenStax textbooks follow a traditional peer review process to ensure they meet high quality standard before publication. Textbooks are developed and peer-reviewed by educators to ensure they are readable and accurate, meet the scope and sequence requirements of each course, are supported by instructor ancillaries, and are available with the latest technology-based learning tools. The free, online version of OpenStax books are kept up-to-date on an ongoing basis. Instructors are encouraged to submit errata suggestions via the OpenStax website, and errata suggestions are reviewed by subject matter experts. Revisions are made when it is determined to be pedagogically necessary. New PDFs and print versions of the books are released each summer when substantial changes are present. OpenStax's original goal was to publish openly licensed textbooks for the 25 highest-enrolled undergraduate college courses, and they exceeded that goal in 2016. All books are available for free in web view and PDF format on openstax.org. The books are also available for a low cost in print, and many of them exist in iBooks.
