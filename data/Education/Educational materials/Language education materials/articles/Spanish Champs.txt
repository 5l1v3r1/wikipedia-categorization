Level 1: greetings, introductions, colors, numbers, clothes, food, body, manners, feelings. Key verbs: to be, to want, to like, to have. Level 2: more colors, more numbers, animals, family, action verbs and commands, adjectives and descriptions. Children pass through several phases as they acquire a language: gathering, key word, and sentence. In the gathering phase, when children are exposed to the new language they start to hear and distinguish sounds. In the key word phase they start to identify and use key content words. For example, to express "I am hungry", they would simply use the key word "hungry". In the sentence phase, children begin to use phrases and complete sentences. There is a long delay from starting to distinguish sounds to being able to use complete sentences. The Spanish Champs curriculum includes resources to enable each phase this natural learning cycle. Spanish Champs uses a combination of songs, karaoke, video skits, games, contests, stories and activities to teach Spanish.
