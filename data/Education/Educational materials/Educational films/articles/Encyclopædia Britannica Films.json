His stentorian style made science and geography topics easy to understand for children. In 1930, he also helped supervise the company\u2019s first major series, profiling the musical instruments of an orchestra (i.e. <i>The Brass Choir</i>, <i>The String Choir</i>, <i>The Woodwind Choir</i>, <i>The Percussion Group</i>).

Dr. Carey Croneis supervised some geology subjects and also worked on the science pavilion at the <a href=\"/wiki/Century_of_Progress\" title=\"Century of Progress\">Century of Progress</a> fair of 1933-34, which (in turn) inspired another newcomer, Edward Shumaker, to join the company and fine-tune the title logos. A renewed slogan read \u201cERPI Films bring the world to the classroom\u201d.\n</p><p>In the spring of 1937, ERPI scored a surprise \u201cblockbuster\u201d with <i>Adventures of Bunny Rabbit</i>. Its widespread appeal was partly due to narrator James Brill ending with a question directed towards the kindergarten and first grade students watching, one that was repeated by their teachers: \u201cAnd now Bunny is once more with his mother. What do YOU think he is telling Mother Gray Rabbit \u2013 and what do YOU think Mother Rabbit is telling Bunny?\u201d Animal pictures were among ERPI\u2019s (and later Britannica\u2019s) best sellers with popular late 30s and \u201840s titles as <i>Three Little Kittens</i>, <i>Snapping Turtle</i> and a post-war dramatization of <a href=\"/wiki/Aesop\" title=\"Aesop\">Aesop</a>\u2019s <i>The Hare and the Tortoise</i> (later redone in <a href=\"/wiki/Animation\" title=\"Animation\">animation</a>).\n</p><p>Geography was covered with a very relatable series called \u201cChildren of Many Lands\u201d, which compared the similarities and differences of daily life outside of the United States. A typical title like <i>Children of Japan</i> made sure children were seen in a classroom not unlike one at home. More exotic was <a href=\"/wiki/Attilio_Gatti\" title=\"Attilio Gatti\">Attilio Gatti</a>\u2019s filming of the \u201cDark Continent\u201d in <i>Pygmies of Africa</i> and Amos Burg\u2019s portrait of <i>People of Western China</i> shortly before the Japanese invasion. Unfortunately <a href=\"/wiki/World_War_II\" title=\"World War II\">World War II</a> curtailed international travel and the films of this type for a while.\n</p><p><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=John_Walker_(producer)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"John Walker (producer) (page does not exist)\">John Walker</a> got his start with 1938\u2019s <i>Navajo Indians</i> and remained a prolific producer through the early 1970s, with a particular emphasis in his later decades with animal subjects and a late sixties \u201cProblems of Conservation\u201d series.\n</p><p>Back in 1932, heads Devereaux and Arnspiger had established a very close relationship with Beardsley Ruml and Robert Maynard Hutchins of the <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_Chicago\" title=\"University of Chicago\">University of Chicago</a>, providing the films the extra prestige of scholarly credits. A promotional book <i>The Educational Talking Picture</i> was published by Devereaux through the University in 1933, followed four years later by Max Brunstetter\u2019s <i>How to Use the Educational Sound Film</i>. The close relationship between ERPI and the university tightened considerably more after John Otterson had left the company to work for <a href=\"/wiki/Paramount_Pictures\" title=\"Paramount Pictures\">Paramount Pictures</a> in 1935.\n</p><p>When Hutchins appointed <a href=\"/wiki/William_Benton_(senator)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"William Benton (senator)\">William B. Benton</a> as the university\u2019s vice president, his involvement with the films was much like that of a production head. By this time, the <a href=\"/wiki/Federal_Communications_Commission\" title=\"Federal Communications Commission\">Federal Communications Commission</a> had started pressuring the parent company AT&amp;T to divest its highly profitable subsidiary. After an attempt to get the <a href=\"/wiki/Rockefeller_Foundation\" title=\"Rockefeller Foundation\">Rockefeller Foundation</a> to purchase ERPI, Benton made another unsuccessful effort with <a href=\"/wiki/Henry_Luce\" title=\"Henry Luce\">Henry Luce</a> of <i><a href=\"/wiki/Life_(magazine)\" title=\"Life (magazine)\">Life</a></i>. (Although the magazine giant initially saw little future in educational films, Time-Life would belatedly enter the market in the sixties.)\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Merging_with_Encyclop.C3.A6dia_Britannica\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Merging_with_Encyclop\u00e6dia_Britannica\">Merging with Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica_Films&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Merging with Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>William Benton and Robert Hutchins had established a successful relationship with chairman Colonel <a href=\"/wiki/Robert_E._Wood\" title=\"Robert E.

Over a lunch meeting held December 9, 1941, Benton managed to persuade Wood to donate Sears\u2019 profitable, but aging, subsidiary <a href=\"/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica,_Inc.\" title=\"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc.\">Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc.</a> to the <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_Chicago\" title=\"University of Chicago\">University of Chicago</a> outright as a <a href=\"/wiki/Tax_write-off\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Tax write-off\">tax write-off</a>. The process of this transaction took more than a year to complete, culminating on February 1, 1943. Benton also acquired the services of EB editor <a href=\"/wiki/Walter_Yust\" title=\"Walter Yust\">Walter Yust</a>. (His son Larry would later become a top filmmaker for the company.)\n</p><p>In a second move, Walter Page of AT&amp;T and <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Kennedy_Stevenson&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Kennedy Stevenson (page does not exist)\">Kennedy Stevenson</a> of Western Electric sold their interests in ERPI Classroom Films to Benton for $1 million, to be paid over the next decade. The University itself didn\u2019t own the company outright, but had the option to acquire half of Benton\u2019s stock (and soon decided not to).\n</p><p>Benton changed the name over to Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Films because he had once heard a school child call the films \u201cburpy\u201d on account of the rhyming. The first titles to sport the new name were released in November 1943. Later on, titles sported a simplified \u201cEB Films\u201d logo. After expanding the facilities with $1.5 million invested, William Benton temporarily left to become <a href=\"/wiki/Assistant_Secretary_of_State_for_Public_Affairs\" title=\"Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs\">Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs</a> under President <a href=\"/wiki/Harry_Truman\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Harry Truman\">Harry Truman</a>, then as a senator and arch adversary of <a href=\"/wiki/Joseph_McCarthy\" title=\"Joseph McCarthy\">Joseph McCarthy</a> before returning in 1952. With Beardsley Ruml mostly in charge, a prestigious board of directors was set up. Operating as president for a time was the future Ford Fund for Adult Education head Cyril Scott Fletcher.\n</p><p>Although production was curtailed during the war (with only two brand-new titles registered for copyright in the year 1945), profits increased dramatically as 150, 000 16mm projectors were in operation by 1946. During this mid-decade period, a great many previously released titles were successfully given new soundtracks in Spanish, French, Portuguese, Italian and other languages for foreign export.\n</p><p><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Milan_Herzog&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Milan Herzog (page does not exist)\">Milan Herzog</a> began a long association with EB in 1946 with <i>The Mailman</i> and other portraits of common occupations. He eventually became one of the most prolific producers. Popular titles later in the fifties and sixties include <i>Tobacco and the Human Body</i> and <i>The Passenger Train (2nd edition)</i>, along with a series on the <a href=\"/wiki/Soviet_Union\" title=\"Soviet Union\">Soviet Union</a> co-directed by Arnold Michaelis.\n</p><p>In an effort to keep the films in line with their educational goals, music scores were rarely used prior to the late 1940s and then only selectively used with a greater focus on narration. While this occasionally made them seem a bit static and lecture-like, it also prevented them from aging fast on account of changing musical tastes (a problem with rival educational films of the period).\n</p><p>Curiously the company was slow to make the transition to color, despite the <a href=\"/wiki/Kodachrome\" title=\"Kodachrome\">Kodachrome</a> 16mm process being popular with rival companies like Bailey Films and <a href=\"/wiki/Coronet_Films\" title=\"Coronet Films\">Coronet Films</a> (starting before the war). The first color EB films were not made until 1946-47, covering painting lectures by Eliot O'Hara and scenic portraits of farm life (i.e. <i>Spring on the Farm</i> and <i>Winter on the Farm</i>). As quoted in the silver jubilee anniversary title <i>Making Films That Teach</i>, \u201cColor is pretty but sometimes expensive for the teaching value you might get from it.\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> Nonetheless, color soon became quite mainstream in the middle fifties, as EB was soon updating popular early titles with all-color remakes such as <i>The Woodwind Choir</i> and <i>Spiders</i>.\n</p><p>In cooperation with Emerson Films, a couple dramatic biographies on famous people were produced economically in Hollywood, marking the first time hired actors were used. For a brief period, it was decided to move forward in this route and a former movie director <a href=\"/wiki/Walter_Colmes\" title=\"Walter Colmes\">Walter Colmes</a> once affiliated with <a href=\"/wiki/Republic_Pictures\" title=\"Republic Pictures\">Republic Pictures</a> headed the company for a two-year period before being succeeded by <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Maurice_Mitchell_(producer)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Maurice Mitchell (producer) (page does not exist)\">Maurice B. Mitchell</a> who would bring EB Films into its most successful years.\n</p><p>Although the overall quality of EB\u2019s product was already ahead of the competition, it had gained further esteem with the arrival of <a href=\"/wiki/John_Barnes_(film_producer)\" title=\"John Barnes (film producer)\">John Barnes</a>, a veteran of CBS radio writing and some stage work. In 1951, Barnes collaborated with producer <a href=\"/wiki/Gordon_Weisenborn\" title=\"Gordon Weisenborn\">Gordon Weisenborn</a> in <i>People Along the Mississippi</i>, one of the earliest school films to address the sticky topic of race relations. (One key scene shows a light-skinned Paul stop playing with his darker-skinned friend due to peer pressure.) Passionate about social rights, Barnes once personally protested the censorship of his biography <i>Sir Francis Drake: The Rise of England Sea Power</i> (featuring an interracial friendship) in Georgia schools.\n</p><p>Before <i><a href=\"/wiki/Brown_v._Board_of_Education\" title=\"Brown v. Board of Education\">Brown v. Board of Education</a></i> (and even years after), many public schools in the United States were still segregated by race. Therefore, EB was initially reluctant to cover many social studies subjects for fear of offending top purchasers in the South.

The following year, he filmed a series of historical subjects in England, among them the socially conscious <i>The Pilgrims</i>, <i>Captain John Smith, Founder of Virginia</i>, and <i>Roger Williams: Founder of Rhode Island</i>. Some of these gained praise even by mainstream theatrical film critics who traditionally ignored school films, like Howard Thompson of the <i><a href=\"/wiki/New_York_Times\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"New York Times\">New York Times</a></i> (July 3, 1955).\n</p><p>In addition to many artistic subjects and some of the best school films covering <i>The Renaissance: Its Beginnings</i>, <a href=\"/wiki/Leonardo_Da_Vinci\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Leonardo Da Vinci\">Leonardo Da Vinci</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Michelangelo\" title=\"Michelangelo\">Michelangelo</a>, he also spearheaded a \u201cHumanities\u201d series sponsored in part by the <a href=\"/wiki/Ford_Foundation\" title=\"Ford Foundation\">Ford Foundation</a> (which had previously back an equally ambitious, but less successful financially, <i>Physics: The Complete Introductory Course</i> that was co-scripted by future president <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Warren_Everote&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Warren Everote (page does not exist)\">Warren Everote</a>).

Occasionally he would battle the front office for this reason, since sometimes \u201centertainment\u201d was questioned in regards to \u201ceducation\u201d. As Geoff Alexander profiled in a series of letters regarding his and director <a href=\"/wiki/Douglas_Campbell_(actor)\" title=\"Douglas Campbell (actor)\">Douglas Campbell</a>\u2019s treatment of <i><a href=\"/wiki/Macbeth\" title=\"Macbeth\">Macbeth</a></i>, president Maurice Mitchell had plenty to say in a letter written June 24, 1964:\n</p>\n<style data-mw-deduplicate=\"TemplateStyles:r856303468\">.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}</style><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p>\"I know that there are great pressures from EBF's men in the field to keep these films entertaining, to make sure that we have lots of drama and action in them, to minimize the lecturing or to clothe it in attractive terms. I have already argued this case in another memorandum --- I remind you now that what happened with Macbeth is the inevitable result of a loose rein in this regard.

He had joined in 1953 as an assistant to top producer Milan Herzog (and later vice president in the mid-sixties), moving up through the ranks by organizing the company\u2019s mailing lists. As marketer for Films Inc. (a subsidiary of EB) and later president of filming, Charles was most enthusiastic in adding both profits and prestige by outsourcing major companies like <a href=\"/wiki/David_L._Wolper\" title=\"David L. Wolper\">David L. Wolper</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/National_Geographic_Society\" title=\"National Geographic Society\">National Geographic Society</a> under the EB banner. Neither the senior Benton nor co-head Mitchell was particularly supportive. Father to son (in a January 7, 1966 letter): \u201cAs you know, I am exceedingly uneasy about your preoccupation with products which do not carry the EBF imprimatur. I have the feeling that you hope to get something for nothing.\u201d <sup id=\"cite_ref-18\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-18\">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Charles left in 1967 (partly pressured out by the elder Benton and Mitchell) and soon convinced EB to split off Films Inc. as a separate company with him in charge. That same year saw two other upsets to the company hierarchy. Mitchell himself accepted a chancellor job with the University of Denver that summer and was replaced by the more disciplined (keeping films under budget) Warren Everote, a veteran at EB since 1946 and previously president for a short period earlier that decade. In July, <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=William_Deneen&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"William Deneen (page does not exist)\">William Deneen</a> left to start up a rival company with <a href=\"/wiki/Columbia_Pictures\" title=\"Columbia Pictures\">Columbia Pictures</a>: the Learning Corporation of America would quickly become one of EB\u2019s biggest rivals in the 16mm field.\n</p><p>During his past decade with EB, William Deneen\u2019s specialty was geography films, being owner of an independent film company since 1950 that was distributing through EB until they absorbed his company and made him vice president. Among his most famous in-depth looks of everyday life overseas were a series on <a href=\"/wiki/Japan\" title=\"Japan\">Japan</a>, <i>Hungary and Communism</i> and a trio shot on <a href=\"/wiki/Samuel_Bronston\" title=\"Samuel Bronston\">Samuel Bronston</a>\u2019s sets of <i><a href=\"/wiki/Fall_of_the_Roman_Empire_(film)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Fall of the Roman Empire (film)\">Fall of the Roman Empire</a></i>, including <i>Claudius: Boy of Ancient Rome</i>. These were certainly the most expensive <i>looking</i> school films of the era, despite being made very economically.\n</p><p>Despite dramatic changes in management, combined with some cost-cutting, the sixties and early seventies produced many memorable classics. A <a href=\"/wiki/United_States_Bill_of_Rights\" title=\"United States Bill of Rights\">Bill of Rights</a> series both dramatized and explained major legal battles that school students often take for granted (examples include <i>Freedom to Speak, People of New York Vs. Irving Feiner</i> and <i>Free Press Vs. Fair Trial By Jury- the Sheppard Case</i>, latter produced by <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Stanley_Croner&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Stanley Croner (page does not exist)\">Stanley Croner</a>). John Barnes, who also contributed to some of these, tackled <i>Shaw vs. Shakespeare</i> on the historical accuracy and personality of <a href=\"/wiki/Julius_Caesar\" title=\"Julius Caesar\">Julius Caesar</a>; this was filmed in 1969 with the cast and sets of a failed British play <i>Her First Roman</i>. <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Larry_Yust&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Larry Yust (page does not exist)\">Larry Yust</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Clifton_Fadiman\" title=\"Clifton Fadiman\">Clifton Fadiman</a> adapted <a href=\"/wiki/Shirley_Jackson\" title=\"Shirley Jackson\">Shirley Jackson</a>\u2019s controversial short story <i>The Lottery</i> despite its shocking (for 1969 school students) ending.\n</p><p>Didactic science films were not always successful in keeping bored students awake and alert, but EB fared better than much of the competition. Special praise goes to <a href=\"/wiki/Cinematographer\" title=\"Cinematographer\">cinematographers</a> such as the very prolific <a href=\"/wiki/Isidore_Mankofsky\" title=\"Isidore Mankofsky\">Isidore Mankofsky</a>, who could insert many close-ups of menacing hands zooming at the screen and low-angle shots of vacationers among the geological close-ups of the typical <i>The Beach: A River of Sand</i>. <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Charles_F._Finance&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Charles F. Finance (page does not exist)\">Charles F. Finance</a> (who carried on through the 1980s), Stanley Croner and <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Warren_Brown_(filmmaker)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Warren Brown (filmmaker) (page does not exist)\">Warren Brown</a> were among those who contributed this and other popular favorites of the long running <a href=\"/wiki/American_Geosciences_Institute\" title=\"American Geosciences Institute\">American Geological Institute</a> series. 8mm loops covering chemistry and medical topics were another market tapped into at this time for the serious science student to study subjects in more detail.\n</p><p>In addition, throughout the late fifties and sixties, were a wide assortment of full color biology films covering everything from protozoa to hummingbirds to veracious <a href=\"/wiki/Army_ant\" title=\"Army ant\">army ants</a> on the hunt; many of these were produced by John Walker and <a href=\"/wiki/Bert_Van_Bork\" title=\"Bert Van Bork\">Bert Van Bork</a>. Also of particular interest was a 1971 <i>Silent Safari</i> series on African animals shot by Jane and Peter Chermayeff, but ignoring the usual narration so that viewers can make their own assessments of the animals\u2019 behavior. (A second series was released a dozen years later, including ostriches and wildebeest.)\n</p><p>As the times changed, so did the popular subjects in demand. A large part of America\u2019s population and their history that had been overlooked before the <a href=\"/wiki/Civil_rights_movement\" title=\"Civil rights movement\">civil rights movement</a> finally got its due, such as <a href=\"/wiki/Henry_McNeal_Turner\" title=\"Henry McNeal Turner\">Henry McNeal Turner</a> in <i>Bishop Turner: Black Nationalist</i> and <i>American Indian Speaks</i>, the latter produced by longtime veteran Thomas G. Smith. The impact of the <a href=\"/wiki/Sexual_revolution\" title=\"Sexual revolution\">sexual revolution</a> on teenagers opened the market for provocative subjects like <i>Venereal Disease: The Hidden Epidemic</i>, another Smith production and among the earliest to advocate <a href=\"/wiki/Condom\" title=\"Condom\">condom</a> use. This was another of EB\u2019s top sellers that the company had to keep pressing prints of, in part because of the uproar in the news media it caused with the more religious and conservative districts.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Post_Benton_Era:_from_16mm_movies_to_video_to_internet\">Post Benton Era: from 16mm movies to video to internet</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica_Films&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Post Benton Era: from 16mm movies to video to internet\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>With William Benton\u2019s death in March 1973 and ownership of Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica moving to the Benton Foundation the following year, EB\u2019s film department entered its last two \u201ctwilight\u201d decades as the industry leader. The gradual decline of the films\u2019 market was not noticed at first since virtually every public school system was well stocked with 16mm projectors and both EB and its rivals (Coronet, Time-Life, Learning Corporation of America and others all in fierce competition) were busy keeping up with the demand. In fact, the seventies were probably the peak decade for 16mm classroom instruction, which made the rapid decline a decade later all the more surprising. <a href=\"/wiki/VHS\" title=\"VHS\">VHS</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Betamax\" title=\"Betamax\">Betamax</a> video cassettes were merely a new mid-decade novelty that was only rarely used prior to the <a href=\"/wiki/Ronald_Reagan\" title=\"Ronald Reagan\">Reagan</a> years. Although the federal government had gradually been decreasing the amount spent on education when <a href=\"/wiki/Jimmy_Carter\" title=\"Jimmy Carter\">Carter</a> was president, it was the mid and late eighties that saw the most rapid decline as the Cold War drew to a close and the Soviet Union was no longer a threat.\n</p><p>After two back-to-back and very brief tenures with Jim Parton (succeeding Warren Everote) and Jack Saunders, Ross Sackett took over the same year as Benton\u2019s death. Among the popular releases of the period included <i>Energy: A Matter of Choices</i> (one of many ephemerals of the decade covering that \u201chot topic\u201d, this one produced by Charles Finance), John Barnes profiling <a href=\"/wiki/John_Keats\" title=\"John Keats\">John Keats</a> and <i>The Bible As Literature</i>,  a comedy pantomime series \u201cBip\u201d featuring <a href=\"/wiki/Marcel_Marceau\" title=\"Marcel Marceau\">Marcel Marceau</a> and many <a href=\"/wiki/Featurette\" title=\"Featurette\">featurette</a> (25+ minutes) co-productions with Avatar Learning covering earthquakes, dinosaurs and sharks. Thomas G. Smith capped off a long career with EB with the 1976-77 production of <i>The Solar System</i> with special computer generated effects not unlike those being used in the early <i><a href=\"/wiki/Star_Wars\" title=\"Star Wars\">Star Wars</a></i> films.\n</p><p>Sackett was followed in 1977 as president by Ralph Wagner, who had married William Benton\u2019s daughter Louise. With a tighter eye on budgets, there were increasing clashes with the filmmakers. The star director, John Barnes, particularly didn\u2019t get along well with Wagner and left soon after completing one of his most popular films, a glossy adaptation of <a href=\"/wiki/Walter_van_Tilburg_Clark\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Walter van Tilburg Clark\">Walter van Tilburg Clark</a>\u2019s apocalyptic sci fi tale told in flashbacks, <a href=\"/wiki/The_Watchful_Gods_and_Other_Stories\" title=\"The Watchful Gods and Other Stories\"><i>The Portable Phonograph</i></a>.\n</p><p>This last film of his was part of an ongoing series of short story adaptations featuring established actors (more familiar on TV and stage) and often released with an additional \u201cpart 2\u201d reel that covered the director\u2019s commentary on the story in question. Others included <i>The Hunt</i> (adapted from <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Most_Dangerous_Game\" title=\"The Most Dangerous Game\">The Most Dangerous Game</a></i> by <a href=\"/wiki/Richard_Connell\" title=\"Richard Connell\">Richard Connell</a>), <a href=\"/wiki/J._M._Synge\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"J. M. Synge\">J. M. Synge</a>\u2019s <i>Well of the Saints</i> and <a href=\"/wiki/Guy_de_Maupassant\" title=\"Guy de Maupassant\">Guy de Maupassant</a>\u2019s  <i>La Paurure</i>. Unfortunately, these ambitious miniature dramas ultimately proved too expensive to survive into the next decade.\n</p><p>By 1980, VHS videos were beginning to be marketed alongside the 16mm films and would quickly overtake the other. A new problem soon erupted: teachers copying films to video and impacting the company\u2019s income. On June 25, 1982, New York\u2019s Board of Cooperative Educational Services was prosecuted for doing this not only by EB, but also Time-Life and the Learning Corporation of America. Although the film companies won, historian Geoff Alexander points out that \u201cperhaps the most disturbing element of the case was that, more than 15 years after the halcyon days of post-Sputnik government largesse, BOCES found it financially more viable to defend a costly lawsuit than to simply buy films and tapes from film companies as it once did.\u201d <sup id=\"cite_ref-19\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-19\">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Not that educational film making showed any decline in quality as the revenue dried up. There was little question that the product of this last great decade was slicker and more sophisticated in visual appeal than a great many films previously. Particularly popular throughout the eighties was <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Bruce_Hoffman_(filmmaker)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Bruce Hoffman (filmmaker) (page does not exist)\">Bruce Hoffman</a>\u2019s cluster of \u201cinside the human body\u201d titles that benefited greatly from the ever advancing developments in <a href=\"/wiki/Microphotography\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Microphotography\">microphotography</a> combined with expert <a href=\"/wiki/Animation\" title=\"Animation\">animation</a> by David Alexovich.\n</p><p>Later that decade, the Benson Foundation donated all Britannica properties to the University of Chicago. Ralph Wagner left the presidency at the end of 1987, with an ex-<a href=\"/wiki/Coronet_Films\" title=\"Coronet Films\">Coronet Films</a> Joe Elliott now taking over. By this time, 16mm films had pretty much been replaced by video cassettes although a few (mostly foreign language versions of older titles) films continued to be distributed to libraries and schools as late as 1991. Longtime vice president assistant Philip Stockton remained as vice president of film/video production under Elliott until 1994 (being succeeded by William Bowe) and kept an ongoing, if declining, annual output that included a multi-part short subject series <i>Science Essentials</i> (a few produced by Stockton and many featuring animation by Steve Boyer), <i>Viruses: What They Are And How They Work</i> (a latter day production from veteran Bert Van Bork with Bill Gudmundson), Judith Conaway\u2019s <i>For Your Baby</i> (which continued a tradition going back the early ERPI era with <a href=\"/wiki/Arnold_Gesell\" title=\"Arnold Gesell\">Arnold Gesell</a>), David Wood and Scott Shearer\u2019s  <i>Mathsense</i> series and, co-produced with York Films, <i>A Galactic Encyclopedia</i>\n</p><p>The shrinking market for educational media eventually hit the company hard and production came to a halt in 1995. The University of Chicago sold its financially struggling EB properties in January 1996 to <a href=\"/wiki/Jacqui_Safra\" title=\"Jacqui Safra\">Jacqui Safra</a> for $135 million.
