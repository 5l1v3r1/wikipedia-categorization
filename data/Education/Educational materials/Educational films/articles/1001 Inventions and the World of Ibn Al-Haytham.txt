1001 Inventions and the World of Ibn Al-Haytham is a 2015 part-animated science education film directed by Ahmed Salim and starring Omar Sharif. It is notable for being Sharif's final film.    The film was produced by 1001 Inventions, a British foundation aiming to propagate the achievements of the Golden Age of Islam.  Both the film and the exhibition were created to coincide with the United Nations campaign celebrating the International Year of Light, operated by UNESCO.   Within the film, Sharif's character helps his granddaughter with a challenging homework assignment about Ibn Al-Haytham, the 11th century scholar  who made significant contributions to the principles of optics and visual perception.
