The Reichsanstalt f端r Film und Bild in Wissenschaft und Unterricht (English: Reich Institute for Film and Images in Science and the Classroom), before 1940 known as the Reichsstelle f端r den Unterrichtsfilm (English: Reich Office for Teaching Films) was a branch of the Reich Ministry of Science, Education and Culture which was charged with the creation of educational films during the Third Reich. The office was founded on June 26, 1934 and was headed by Kurt Gauger. By 1944 the Reichsanstalt had produced some 900 films; over 270 of them were for schools, the rest were for research and teaching purposes at universities. A total of more than half a million film copies were delivered. How many of these films were actually used, is unclear. The office also served as a lender for teaching media such as films and light pictures as well as for demonstration devices. In 1943, there were 36 provincial authorities and 1243 administrative centers in the occupied territories. It also edited a series of media pedagogical writings and from 1935 to 1943 also the magazine Film und Bild in Wissenschaft, Bildung und Volksbildung. On Feb. 6, 1935 a "Abteilung Hochschule" - university division - was established within the Reichsstelle, and in 1936 it absorbed the Deutschen Gesellschaft f端r wissenschaftliche Filme. In December 1945, the Institut f端r Film und Bild in Wissenschaft und Unterricht (FWU) was founded immediately after the capture of the inventory by US soldiers as a successor organization. The breakdown in district areas has been maintained.
