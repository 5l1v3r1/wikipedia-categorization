Established in 1963, the Ralph R. Teetor Educational Award recognizes and honors those young educators who are successfully preparing engineers for meeting the challenges that face society. Reflecting the firm belief of its donor that engineering educators are the most effective link between engineering students and their future careers, the SAE Ralph Teetor Educational Fund's major program is focused on younger engineering educators.
