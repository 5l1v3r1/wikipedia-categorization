The Red Maple Award is an award in the Ontario Library Association (OLA) Forest of Reading Awards. The Red Maple Award celebrates fiction (since 1998) and non-fiction (every other year since 2005) Canadian books for grades 7-8 (12-14) every year. Out of a ten nominated books in each category students must read a minimum of five to vote for their favourite. The winner is chosen by the most popular book in all participating libraries, schools, groups, etc. The 2017 Winner for fiction is Shooter by Caroline Pignat. The 2017 Winner for non-fiction is Child Soldier: When Boys and Girls are Used in War by Michel Chikwanine, Jessica Dee Humphreys, & Claudia DÃ¡vila. Five years after the original Silver Birch Award was created an award for grades 7-9, the Red Maple Award was created. In 2005 a non-fiction subcategory of the Red Maple Award was created. It runs on all odd numbered years. These are the books that were nominated for a Red Maple Award each year but were not chosen as a winner. The books are ordered by year and the author's last name (Last name of first author if multiple).
