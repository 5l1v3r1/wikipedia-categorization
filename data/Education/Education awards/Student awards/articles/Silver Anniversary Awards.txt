 The Silver Anniversary Awards are given each year by the American National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) to recognize six distinguished former student-athletes on their 25th anniversary as college graduates.  The Silver Anniversary Awards were first given in 1973, when five distinguished former student-athletes were honored.  In 1986, the number of annual honorees was increased to six. In order to be eligible, the nominee must be a college graduate and a varsity letter-winner at an NCAA member institution and must have achieved personal distinction since his or her graduation.  The selection criteria are weighted 40 percent to the nominee’s status as a prominent collegiate athlete and 60 percent to the nominee’s career achievement.  Recipients of the Silver Anniversary Awards include Troy Aikman and Dara Torres (both 2014), Gail Devers and Chad Hennings (both 2013), David Robinson (2012), Joe Girardi and Bo Jackson (both 2011), Doug Flutie and Jackie Joyner-Kersee (both 2010), Steve Young (2009), Mike Singletary (2006), Mark Johnson (2005), John Naber (2002), Steve Largent (2001) Archie Griffin (2001), Bill Walton (1999), Sally Ride (1998), Jack Youngblood (1996), Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (1994), Jim Ryun (1994) and Dick Butkus (1990).
