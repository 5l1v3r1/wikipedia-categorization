The Department of Mathematics at Columbia University has presented a Professor Van Amringe Mathematical Prize each year (since 1910), based on a very challenging examination.  The prize was established in 1910 by George G. Dewitt, Class of 1867. It was named after John Howard Van Amringe, who taught mathematics at Columbia (holding a professorship from 1865 to 1910), was the first Dean of Columbia College, and was the first president of the American Mathematical Society (between 1888 and 1890). For many years, the prize was awarded to the freshman or sophomore mathematics student at Columbia College deemed most proficient in the mathematical subjects designated during the year of the award. More recently (since 2003), the prize has been awarded to three Columbia College students (a freshman, a sophomore, and a junior) who are deemed most proficient in their class in the mathematical subjects designated during the year of the award.
