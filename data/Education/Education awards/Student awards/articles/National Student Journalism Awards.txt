The National Student Journalism Awards are an annual UK-wide student journalism competition organised by the National Union of Students of the United Kingdom (NUS). Launched in 1947, the awards were run in association with The Guardian newspaper from 1978 until 1999 (when The Guardian independently launched the Guardian Student Media Awards). Recent sponsors include The Independent (1999-2002),  The Daily Mirror  (2003-2005)  and The Press Association (2006-).  The Awards are launched in May each year, with a closing date at the beginning of July. Typically students are required to send their best three articles from the past academic year to be critiqued by a panel of senior national journalists. In October, a shortlist of five entrants per category is released. The winners and runners-up in each category are announced at a London ceremony in November.
