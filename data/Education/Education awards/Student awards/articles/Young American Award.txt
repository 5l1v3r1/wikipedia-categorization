 The Young American Award is an award of the Boy Scouts of America for outstanding college students ages 19 through 25 who have achieved excellence in the fields of art, athletics, business, community service, education, government, humanities, literature, music, religion, and science; and have given service to their community, state, and/or country. The award was presented at both the national and the local council levels, but the national program was discontinued in 2009 due to funding. A maximum of five national awards had been presented annually while local awards continue to be unlimited. Each local council made the determination for nominating its candidates for national competition.  Recipients of the national award also received a $7,500 cash award that was primarily funded by Learning for Life.  Membership in any of the BSA or Learning for life programs is not obligatory.   The national award consisted of a silver medallion suspended from a red, white and blue ribbon worn around the neck.  The medallion bears the images of young man and a young woman above a wreath.  Local recipients receive a gold version of the medallion affixed to a wooden plaque.  Recipients may wear the corresponding square knot insignia, with a silver knot on a red, white and blue background, on the BSA uniform. The award was first presented in 1954 by the United States Department of Justice as the Young American Award for Service and the Young American Award for Bravery.  Each of these awards were to be presented to two young people from each state and territory annually.  The Justice Department had trouble promoting the award and approached the BSA for assistance in 1966. With the launch of coeducational Exploring in 1968, the BSA took on the role of soliciting and receiving nominations, and assumed the program in 1971.  The awards were originally available to youth ages 15 through 25; in 2005, it was changed to college students ages 19 through 25. The original medals were suspended from neck ribbons, but the BSA soon changed them to a table medal, with the medallion placed in a block of acrylic glass.  The ribbon version of the medal was restored for the national award after the introduction of Venturing. The square knot insignia is the same as was used for three former Exploring awards: the Explorer Silver Award, Exploring Achievement Award and the Exploring G.O.L.D. Award.  This knot may also be worn by those Scouting and Venturing leaders who have earned the predecessor awards.  From 1968 through 2008, there have been 188 recipients of the national award.   1968 1969 1970 1971 1972 1973 1974 1975 1976 1977 1978 1979 1980 1981 1982 1988 1990 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Per the national office national awards will no longer be given.
