After receiving extensive training in theater criticism and review <a href=\"/wiki/Writing\" title=\"Writing\">writing</a>, they attend plays and musicals at other high schools in their area.

The program began in Fairfax and immediately became popular among high school drama departments in the area, growing from 14 schools in the fall of 1999 to 23 schools by that spring. The Cappies quickly spread to encompass the entire metro Washington, D.C., area. <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Washington_Post\" title=\"The Washington Post\">The Washington Post</a></i> and several other local papers published student-written reviews, often with photographs (They have since ceased this activity, but instead now post these reviews online in a section entitled \"Tomorrow's Critics\".). As a result, the Cappies became a showcase for local theater and journalism talent, with over 50 schools around Washington, the largest Cappies region. Since 2002, it has operated nationwide, with new regional groups appearing yearly.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Organization_and_process\">Organization and process</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Critics_and_Awards_Program_for_High_School_Students&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Organization and process\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>To start a Cappies program, one must organize a small local meeting with students, parents, and teachers. Four schools must participate for the application to be approved. A steering committee (including a Program director, chair, treasurer, and two other members) is formed, and a charter application must be applied for. While waiting for approval, one should find local newspapers/media outlets that are willing to publish 1-2 reviews on a weekly basis. Once approved, an $300 annual application fee must be paid to Cappies, plus a $5\u201310 per-critic fee that is assessed in November based on critic training sessions and enrollments in the online information services. Each regional steering committee determines the per-school fee requirements.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Each regional program has a steering committee, with a charter from The Cappies. These are <a href=\"/wiki/Volunteering\" title=\"Volunteering\">volunteers</a> who oversee the work done by critics and teacher-mentors (who are also volunteers), and who then produce the Cappies Gala.\n</p><p>Participating schools select one show (a <a href=\"/wiki/Play_(theatre)\" title=\"Play (theatre)\">play</a> or a <a href=\"/wiki/Musical_theatre\" title=\"Musical theatre\">musical</a>) as their Cappies show. Some smaller Cappies programs allow schools to select two shows. The schools also select teachers to be mentors, who supervise the student critics and help maintain the integrity of the review-writing process. Before the season begins, the mentors and critics receive training from Cappies officials and are often aided by local journalists.\n</p><p>On the night of a Cappies show, the critics arrive early, attend the <a href=\"/wiki/Performance\" title=\"Performance\">performance</a>, and hold private discussions beforehand, during <a href=\"/wiki/Intermission\" title=\"Intermission\">intermission</a>, and after the show. Afterward, they do a preliminary <a href=\"/wiki/Awards\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Awards\">awards</a> evaluation, selecting who will be on the Cappie awards ballot at the end of the year. After returning home, each <a href=\"/wiki/Critic\" title=\"Critic\">critic</a> writes a 200- to 600-word review. The mentors select the reviews they consider the most honest, objective, and best-written, which are then forwarded to local newspapers, many of whom publish these reviews with student bylines.\n</p><p>Critics are encouraged to write real reviews, differentiating between shows that are outstanding and those that fall short in various ways. Cappies reviews can and usually do include criticisms, but these should be objective and fair. Also, individuals responsible for a problem should not be named. For example, if a <a href=\"/wiki/Vocalist\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Vocalist\">vocalist</a> sings <a href=\"/wiki/Off-key\" title=\"Off-key\">off-key</a>, a critic may state that as an issue in the show, but may not identify the vocalist. With these rules, the Cappies program reflects a consensus among theater teachers that at the high school level, criticisms are appropriate if they are constructive, but not if they are harsh, sarcastic, or personal.\n</p><p>After awards voting, each program then holds a Cappies <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gala\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wiktionary:gala\">Gala</a> to present Cappie awards and to celebrate the year's shows. Sometimes these galas are held at schools, and other times at major theater venues. The Cappies of the National Capital Area holds its gala in the Concert Hall of the <a href=\"/wiki/Kennedy_Center\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Kennedy Center\">Kennedy Center</a>, the center's largest performance space. These galas are formal and generally include local VIP award presenters, along with performances of songs or scenes from nominated shows. They usually run from two-and-a-half to three hours, and some are televised.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Cappie_Awards\">Cappie Awards</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Critics_and_Awards_Program_for_High_School_Students&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Cappie Awards\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<ol><li>Critic (based on gender or year in school)</li>\n<li>Critic Team</li>\n<li>Marketing and Publicity</li>\n<li>Sound</li>\n<li>Make-Up</li>\n<li>Props</li>\n<li>Special Effects and/or Technology</li>\n<li>Lighting</li>\n<li>Sets</li>\n<li>Costumes</li>\n<li>Stage Crew</li>\n<li>Stage Management*</li>\n<li>Orchestra</li>\n<li>Choreography</li>\n<li>Creativity</li>\n<li>Ensemble in a Play</li>\n<li>Ensemble in a Musical</li>\n<li>Featured Actor</li>\n<li>Featured Actress</li>\n<li>Female Dancer</li>\n<li>Male Dancer</li>\n<li>Female Vocalist</li>\n<li>Male Vocalist</li>\n<li>Comic Actress in a Play</li>\n<li>Comic Actor in a Play</li>\n<li>Comic Actress in a Musical</li>\n<li>Comic Actor in a Musical</li>\n<li>Supporting Actress in a Play</li>\n<li>Supporting Actor in a Play</li>\n<li>Supporting Actress in a Musical</li>\n<li>Supporting Actor in a Musical</li>\n<li>Lead Actress in a Play</li>\n<li>Lead Actor in a Play</li>\n<li>Lead Actress in a Musical</li>\n<li>Lead Actor in a Musical</li>\n<li>Song</li>\n<li>Play</li>\n<li>Musical</li></ol>\n<p>* The Stage Management category is only featured in the Orange County, California chapter of Cappies.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Awards_rules\">Awards rules</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Critics_and_Awards_Program_for_High_School_Students&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Awards rules\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>At the end of the school year, within each program, critics who review the required minimum number of shows (usually five) become <a href=\"/wiki/Adjudicator\" title=\"Adjudicator\">judges</a> for Cappie nominations and awards. Except for critic awards (determined by a digital formula), all Cappie nominations and awards are decided by student critics.\n</p><p>The student critics gather at a central computer site to vote. This process is carefully supervised by adult proctors, and reviewed for accuracy by a trustee and auditor. Depending on the program, there can be anywhere from three to five nominees per award category. The nominees are announced shortly after the voting.\n</p><p>The outcome of all awards is determined by unique software developed in 2002 by two high school students from <a href=\"/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson_High_School_for_Science_and_Technology\" title=\"Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology\">Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology</a> in <a href=\"/wiki/Alexandria,_Virginia\" title=\"Alexandria, Virginia\">Alexandria, Virginia</a>.\n</p><p>Awards are only given to high school students in grades 9-12.

A Cappies show that has adults exceeding the allowed level of involvement is not eligible for that category, but is eligible for all other awards.\n</p><p>A steering committee of a regional Cappies program can, if it chooses, give a Special Award for Service to a high school student who gave exceptional help, either to the Cappies or to high school theater throughout his or her region.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Cappies_International_Theater\">Cappies International Theater</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Critics_and_Awards_Program_for_High_School_Students&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Cappies International Theater\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Every summer, winners of Lead Actor and Actress awards from all programs are invited to attend the Cappies International Theater.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> This CIT company presents three shows, all written entirely by high school students: <i>Starz!</i> (monologues, songs, and minimusicals), <i>Playz!</i> (short plays), and a full-length student-written musical. The latter two are performed at the Kennedy Center Theater Lab.\n</p><p>The Cappies International Theater is a summer program focused on the development of dramatic and musical skills. They produce several shows in different categories, and often perform the work of their peers.
