ACM Student Research Competition (abbreviated as ACM SRC or SRC) is an annual multi-tiered research presentation competition conducted by Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and Microsoft.  The competition spans more than 20 major ACM conferences, hosting special poster sessions to showcase research at the undergraduate and graduate level. Selected semi-finalists add a slide presentation and compete for prizes in both undergraduate and graduate categories based on their knowledge, contribution, and quality of presentation.  Those taking first place at the second-level competitions are invited to compete in the annual Grand Finals. Three top students in each category are selected as winners each year, representing approximately the top 1-2% of competing students.  First-round conferences include International Conference on Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques (SIGRAPH),  International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE),  Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing,  ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation, and many others. 2016-2017 Graduate Student Winners: 2016-2017 Undergraduate Student Winners:  2015-2016 Graduate Student Winners: 2015-2016 Undergraduate Student Winners:
