The King's Scholarship is a prestigious merit-based scholarship for overseas undergraduate studies awarded to upper-secondary school graduates in Thailand. The qualifying examinations are organized by the Office of the Civil Service Commission, and are extremely competitive; a total of nine scholarships are awarded annually. The scholarship is widely considered to be the greatest academic achievement possible for Thai school students. Unlike other Thai Government scholarships, the King's Scholarship does not have bond requirements for recipients to work for the Thai Government. The only requirement of the scholarship is that recipients return to work in Thailand for a period equal to the duration of their studies. The scholarships were awarded by HM King Bhumibol Adulyadej, although as of late they have not been presented in person. In later years, scholarships are now awarded by HRH Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn on behalf of the king.  The scholarship was first awarded by King Chulalongkorn, and until its cancellation in 1933 after the change of government to a constitutional monarchy, was awarded to two students annually. The scholarship in its current form was initiated by King Bhumibol, as a revival of the programme, in 1965.
