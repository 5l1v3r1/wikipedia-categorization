There are also <a href=\"/wiki/National_Junior_College_Athletic_Association\" title=\"National Junior College Athletic Association\">National Junior College Athletic Association</a> (NJCAA) and NAIA, the <a href=\"/wiki/National_Association_of_Intercollegiate_Athletics\" title=\"National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics\">National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics</a>.\n</p><p>In 1973, the NCAA split its membership into three divisions: <a href=\"/wiki/NCAA_Division_I\" title=\"NCAA Division I\">Division I</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/NCAA_Division_II\" title=\"NCAA Division II\">Division II</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/NCAA_Division_III\" title=\"NCAA Division III\">Division III</a>. Under NCAA rules, Division I and Division II schools can offer scholarships to athletes for playing a sport. Division III schools may not offer any athletic <a href=\"/wiki/Scholarship\" title=\"Scholarship\">scholarships</a>. Generally, larger schools compete in Division I and smaller schools in II and III. Most schools give offers to eligible students in most circumstances.\n</p><p>Division I football is further divided into the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS, formerly I-A) and Football Championship Subdivision (FCS, formerly I-AA). The two differ in several ways:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Postseason system: FBS does not have a <a href=\"/wiki/College_football_national_championships_in_NCAA_Division_I_FBS\" title=\"College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS\">national championship</a> officially sponsored by the NCAA. The four-team <a href=\"/wiki/College_Football_Playoff\" title=\"College Football Playoff\">College Football Playoff</a>, which began with the 2014 season, is operated by the commissioners of the FBS conferences. Most of the college football postseason involves <a href=\"/wiki/Bowl_game\" title=\"Bowl game\">bowl games</a>, both inside and outside the CFP structure. FCS uses an NCAA-operated <a href=\"/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_Football_Championship\" title=\"NCAA Division I Football Championship\">single elimination playoff</a>, which has involved 24 teams since <a href=\"/wiki/2013_NCAA_Division_I_FCS_football_season\" title=\"2013 NCAA Division I FCS football season\">2013</a>.</li>\n<li>Number of football scholarships: FBS schools are allowed 85 players receiving athletic aid, while FCS schools are allowed 63 scholarships. The wording is a very important distinction for another reason.</li>\n<li>Awarding of partial scholarships: Because each player receiving athletic aid for football counts fully against an FBS team's scholarship limit, this effectively means that all players awarded football scholarships at FBS schools receive full scholarships. On the other hand, FCS schools are allowed to divide their 63 scholarships among no more than 85 individual players.</li></ul>\n<p>Some schools or leagues permitted by the NCAA to award athletic scholarships nevertheless prohibit them among their students. An example is the <a href=\"/wiki/Ivy_League\" title=\"Ivy League\">Ivy League</a>, which is part of Division I FCS. The three <a href=\"/wiki/United_States_service_academies\" title=\"United States service academies\">service academies</a> that participate in Division I FBS football (<a href=\"/wiki/United_States_Military_Academy\" title=\"United States Military Academy\">Army</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/United_States_Naval_Academy\" title=\"United States Naval Academy\">Navy</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/United_States_Air_Force_Academy\" title=\"United States Air Force Academy\">Air Force</a>) are effectively exempt from NCAA scholarship limits because all students at those schools, whether or not they are varsity athletes, receive full scholarships from the service branch that operates the academy.\n</p><p>Institutions that engage in misconduct may be stripped of the ability to award a certain number of athletic scholarships. The ultimate penalty, the suspension of an entire athletic program from participation for a set period of time, is popularly known as <a href=\"/wiki/Death_penalty_(NCAA)\" title=\"Death penalty (NCAA)\">\"The Death Penalty\"</a>; it has only been levied three times against schools now in Division I: against <a href=\"/wiki/Kentucky_Wildcats_men%27s_basketball\" title=\"Kentucky Wildcats men&#39;s basketball\">Kentucky basketball</a> in 1952, Southwestern Louisiana (now <a href=\"/wiki/Louisiana_Ragin%27_Cajuns\" title=\"Louisiana Ragin&#39; Cajuns\">Louisiana</a>) basketball in 1973, and <a href=\"/wiki/SMU_Mustangs_football\" title=\"SMU Mustangs football\">SMU football</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Southern_Methodist_University_football_scandal\" title=\"Southern Methodist University football scandal\">in 1986</a>.\n</p><p>In addition to the regulations imposed by the NCAA on the educational institution, the rules governing the provision of athletic scholarship and financial aid are also exhaustive. As noted above, NCAA bylaws place a cap on the number of student-athletes that participate in a given sport at a particular school, who are eligible to receive institutional aid.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Hakim_1-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Hakim-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> Institutional aid is defined as the financial aid granted to a student-athlete by the institution in which they are enrolled<sup id=\"cite_ref-Hakim_1-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Hakim-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> Financial aid that has not been provided by the school will render the athlete ineligible, unless the aid is received from a guardian or dependent, it has been awarded for reasons separate from the individual's athletic ability, or it has been provided by a recognized and continuing program that may or may not recognize athletic ability as a major criterion (i.e. National Merit Scholarship or as an honorary high school award).<sup id=\"cite_ref-Hakim_1-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Hakim-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> There is also a limit to the amount of money that may be awarded through an athletic scholarship. Specifically, it must not exceed the cost of the individual's education otherwise it is considered \"pay\", which violates an athlete's amateur status.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Hakim_1-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Hakim-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Academic eligibility, in addition to the other requirements mentioned, has been a longstanding issue in the history of college athletics. In order to respond to the lack of national academic standards, the NCAA passed the 1.600 GPA rule in 1962 in order for freshmen to receive athletic scholarships.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Smith_2-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Smith-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> However, this decision received widespread criticism and was eventually abolished in 1973.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Smith_2-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Smith-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> In its wake, the American Council on Education (ACE) presented Proposition 48 to the NCAA conference in 1983.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Smith_2-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Smith-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> Instead of a minimum 1.600 freshmen GPA, it recommended that for a student to be eligible they must obtain a 2.0 high school GPA, take 11 core high school courses, and score either a 700 on the <a href=\"/wiki/SAT\" title=\"SAT\">SAT</a> or a 15 on the <a href=\"/wiki/ACT_(test)\" title=\"ACT (test)\">ACT</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Smith_2-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Smith-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> However, just as the 1.600 rule generated controversy, so to did Proposition 48. Joseph B. Johnson, the president of <a href=\"/wiki/Grambling_State_University\" title=\"Grambling State University\">Grambling State University</a> and a representative of the National Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher Education argued that it \"[discriminated] against student-athletes from low-income and minority-group families by introducing arbitrary SAT and ACT cut off scores as academic criteria for eligibility.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-Smith_2-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Smith-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> To address this, the NCAA added a partial qualifier to the suggested guidelines. Thus, under the revision, an athlete who met either the 2.0 high school GPA or 700 SAT/15 ACT score would be eligible to receive a scholarship, but would be unable to practice with or play for the team for one academic year.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Smith_2-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Smith-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> This partial qualifier was subsequently overturned in 1989 following the passage of Prop 42.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Smith_2-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Smith-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> However, amendments to Prop 42 restored it after much protest.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Smith_2-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Smith-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> The newest amendment to Proposition 48, Prop 16, was passed in 1992 and later revised in 2008. As of 2008, under Prop 16, a sliding scale for standardized test scores was expanded to allow for a zero score to be allowed in a test, as long as the high school GPA was sufficient to balance it out. Moreover, the number of core high school courses required was increased to 14.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Smith_2-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Smith-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Once a high school senior is deemed eligible to receive an athletic scholarship for their participation on a sports team, they must then follow a number of explicit steps in order to participate at the collegiate level. In particular, the NCAA mandates that they sign a National College Letter of Intent (NLI), which is effectively an agreement that binds the student-athlete to institution in which they have chosen to enroll.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Hakim_1-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Hakim-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Some applicants choose commercial third parties to act as intermediaries which seek out scholarships and facilitate the application process.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Division_I\">Division I</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Athletic_scholarship&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Division I\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Origin_of_athletic_scholarships_in_the_U.S.\">Origin of athletic scholarships in the U.S.</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Athletic_scholarship&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Origin of athletic scholarships in the U.S.\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<table class=\"plainlinks metadata ambox ambox-content ambox-one_source\" role=\"presentation\"><tbody><tr><td class=\"mbox-image\"><div style=\"width:52px\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Question book-new.svg\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png\" width=\"50\" height=\"39\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/75px-Question_book-new.svg.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/100px-Question_book-new.svg.png 2x\" data-file-width=\"512\" data-file-height=\"399\" /></a></div></td><td class=\"mbox-text\"><div class=\"mbox-text-span\">This section <b>relies largely or entirely on a single <a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Identifying_reliable_sources\" title=\"Wikipedia:Identifying reliable sources\">source</a></b>.<span class=\"hide-when-compact\"> Relevant discussion may be found on the <a href=\"/wiki/Talk:Athletic_scholarship##\" title=\"Talk:Athletic scholarship\">talk page</a>.

As the popularity of sports grew, colleges also began to actively recruit individuals, as well as to offer scholarships.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Hakim_1-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Hakim-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> As early as the 1870s, both colleges and universities were providing financial support and incentives to athletes.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Hakim_1-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Hakim-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> It was not an uncommon practice at this time for non-students to participate in order to increase the success of a team.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Hakim_1-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Hakim-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> In fact, one story tells of a farm boy recruited to play football at the <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_Kansas\" title=\"University of Kansas\">University of Kansas</a> in 1895.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Hakim_1-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Hakim-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> As a result of these practices, numerous concerns were raised, including the desire to regulate college athletics. In 1905, the NCAA was created with the intention of \"the regulation and supervision of college athletics throughout the United States, in order that the athletic activities in colleges and universities of the United States may be maintained on an ethical plan in keeping with the dignity and high purpose of education.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-Hakim_1-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Hakim-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> Right from the start, the NCAA expressed a commitment to preserving both education and amateurism within college athletics. Toward this goal, the NCAA was forced to address student funding, specifically alumni sponsorship. Thus, in 1939 the NCAA delivered a statement which emphasized the <a href=\"/wiki/Amateurism\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Amateurism\">amateur</a> status of student-athletes and stated that financial awards would be needs based and independent of the individual's continued athletic participation.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Hakim_1-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Hakim-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> Then, in 1950, under the governance of the NCAA, colleges developed the athletic scholarship, as a way to pay prospective student-athletes. As a consequence, prospective students would be awarded financially on the basis of athletic ability.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Hakim_1-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Hakim-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> For the next twenty years, there were no limits, as set by the NCAA, on the number of scholarships that an educational institution could award players, as well as no limit on the length of the scholarship term.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Hakim_1-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Hakim-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> Moreover, if an athlete withdrew participation from his sport, his scholarship could not be revoked.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Hakim_1-14\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Hakim-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> However, this all changed at the NCAA's annual convention in 1973.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"NCAA_bylaws_governing_Division_I_athletic_scholarships\">NCAA bylaws governing Division I athletic scholarships</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Athletic_scholarship&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: NCAA bylaws governing Division I athletic scholarships\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>On January 13, 1973 the NCAA revised the scholarship system, and voted to institute a one-year scholarship as opposed to the four-year scholarship already in place.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Hakim_1-15\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Hakim-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-Smith_2-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Smith-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> Today, Article 15 of the NCAA Manual Bylaws governs the regulations regarding financial aid grants and athletic scholarships for student athletes.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Hakim_1-16\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Hakim-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> As of 2010, Bylaw 15.3.3.1. for Division I athletic programs differs little from the one-year rule invoked in 1973, as it reads, \"If a student's athletics ability is considered in any degree in awarding financial aid, such aid shall neither be awarded for a period in excess of one academic year nor for a period less than one academic year.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-NCAA_4-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-NCAA-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> In addition to the \"One-Year Period\", the Bylaws also address recommendations made to extend the one-year term, as well as the policies surrounding injury or illness. Specifically, Bylaw 15.3.3.1.3 states that \"It is not permissible for an institution to assure the prospective student-athlete that it automatically will continue a grant-in-aid past the one-year period if the recipient sustains an injury that prevents him or her from competing in intercollegiate athletics, but an institutional representative may inform the prospective student-athlete of the regular institutional policy related to renewal or continuation of aid past the one-year period for recipients who become ill or injured during their participation.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-NCAA_4-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-NCAA-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> Moreover, Bylaw 15.3.4 addresses the instances in which an award may be reduced or canceled during the period of the award. According to the NCAA, this applies if a student-athlete becomes ineligible to compete, engages in fraudulent behavior (i.e. provides false information on their application, letter of intent, or financial aid agreement), engages in misconduct that results in disciplinary action, or voluntarily ends participation in the sport.<sup id=\"cite_ref-NCAA_4-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-NCAA-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> However, the NCAA asserts that the student-athlete must be awarded a hearing before the reduction or cancellation occurs.<sup id=\"cite_ref-NCAA_4-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-NCAA-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> In addition to the circumstances in which reduction or cancellation of an award is permissible, there are circumstances in which such action cannot be taken during the term period. Specifically, financial aid cannot be withdrawn or reduced during the award period based on athletic ability, performance, or contribution to success. This is true also in the event of injury, illness, or the result of a physical or mental condition.<sup id=\"cite_ref-NCAA_4-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-NCAA-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Future_directions\">Future directions</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Athletic_scholarship&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Future directions\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>As a consequence of the complaints voiced and involvement by the <a href=\"/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice\" title=\"United States Department of Justice\">Justice Department</a>, in August 2011 the Division I Board of Directors adopted multiyear scholarship legislation to allow Division I schools to provide scholarships for a period greater than one year<sup id=\"cite_ref-Hosick_5-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Hosick-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> This legislation was one of many steps the Board of Directors took after the NCAA President Mark Emmert organized a meeting to discuss issues with the operation of Division I athletics.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Division_I_6-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Division_I-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> Voting to override Proposal No 2011-97 (as it was named) was open until Friday, February 17, 2012.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Division_I_6-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Division_I-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> By a very narrow margin, the multiyear scholarship legislation was upheld.

A typical Canadian university program could cost between $5,000-$6,000 Canadian per year, where as an NCAA school charges between $25,000 to $40,000 US to attend their programs. Compounding this is the cost of travel to and from the university for both student and family and the associated costs of living away from home. Based on the information above, Canadian schools have less tuition to cover and also do not have to include substantial federal/provincial scholarships and academic scholarships in their scholarship declarations.\n</p><p>While the competitive standard for some sports may be higher in some Division I (and sometimes Division II) schools, this does vary. In general, this difference would not materialize until the play-off portion of the season, where the standard is much higher overall than the general standard of NCAA competition.\n</p><p>The academic standard for athletes is lower in United States and leaves many Canadian students returning to Canada having to take extra courses and in some cases, extra years of study in order to have their academic qualifications recognized.\n</p><p>U Sports schools are also not bound by the tight NCAA rules surrounding contacts with athletes and in reality, means that U Sports coaches have the potential to develop their athletes to a higher standard, while also maintaining higher academics due to the above-mentioned differences in academic standards.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"United_Kingdom\">United Kingdom</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Athletic_scholarship&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10\" title=\"Edit section: United Kingdom\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In the United Kingdom entrance scholarships based on sporting ability  are not traditional, though contrary to popular belief they are not actually banned.
