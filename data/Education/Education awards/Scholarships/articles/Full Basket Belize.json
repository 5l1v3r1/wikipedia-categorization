Secondary school fees and related costs are relatively high in Belize (between US$450-1500 per year), and for many Belizeans secondary school is simply unaffordable.  Approximately one-third of Belizean children do not make it past primary (elementary) school.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The FBB Scholars Program offers opportunity to escape the cycle of poverty that plagues a large segment of Belizean society by providing the means for Belizean children to attend secondary school.\n</p><p>The FBB Scholars Program was established in 2005, with the aim to providing secondary school scholarships to needy and deserving students in Belize.  As of the academic year 2015-16, 150 students had received scholarships that pay for their tuition, fees, books, and uniforms.\n</p><p>The FBB Scholars program is implemented on a school-by-school basis, with memoranda of understanding (MOU) signed between interested school administrators\u2014typically by the school principal\u2014and FBB.  Using this model, FBB has signed MOU with secondary schools in all six Belizean districts.  FBB annually solicits accredited secondary schools to participate in the scholarship program.

Typically, five grants of up to US$1,000 each are awarded yearly.  More than 33 projects have been funded as of January 2016.

Founding members included:  Jeffrey Cleveland, Kristi Drexler, Robin Mardeusz, Maya Ravindranath, Sarah Reynolds, Sandy Roter, Donna Statler, Maura Varley, and Brenda (Link) Williams.  By April 2004, the initial steering committee was formed, bylaws were written, 501(c)(3) applications and paperwork were submitted, and two small seed grants were secured \u2014 one from the <a href=\"/wiki/National_Peace_Corps_Association\" title=\"National Peace Corps Association\">National Peace Corps Association</a> (NPCA), with which the organization is affiliated; and the other from <a href=\"/wiki/Johns_Hopkins_University\" title=\"Johns Hopkins University\">Johns Hopkins University</a>.  In 2012, the organization changed its name to Full Basket Belize (FBB).\n</p><p>Since inception in 2004, the organization has grown significantly in both world-wide support and contributions.  In 2005 the first scholarship program was created in <a href=\"/wiki/Stann_Creek_District\" title=\"Stann Creek District\">Stann Creek District</a>.  In 2006 IFOB's Community Grants Program was established.  By the fall of 2015, 150 Belizean students had received scholarships to attend secondary school, and more than 33 community organizations had received grants in the areas of health, education,  environment, youth and community economic development.  \n</p><p>Every two years Full Basket Belize elects a Board of Directors.  Day-to-day operations are handled by board members and a small group of volunteers.  The organization's mission statement states that Full Basket Belize is to improve the education, health, and environment of Belizean communities and support youth and community economic development through scholarships and community grants.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a
