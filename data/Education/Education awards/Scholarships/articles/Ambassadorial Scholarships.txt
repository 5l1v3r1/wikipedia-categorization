Ambassadorial Scholarships (founded 1947) was a program of the Rotary Foundation. The program ended in 2013.  From 1947 to 2013, nearly 38,000 men and women from about 100 nations studied abroad under its auspices. The purpose of the Ambassadorial Scholarships program was to further international understanding and friendly relations among people of different countries and geographical areas. The program sponsored several types of scholarships for undergraduate and graduate students as well as for qualified professionals pursuing vocational studies. While abroad, scholars served as goodwill ambassadors to the host country and gave presentations about their homelands to Rotary clubs and other groups. Upon returning home, scholars shared with Rotarians and others the experiences that led to a greater understanding of their host country.
