The horn effect, closely related to the halo effect, is a form of cognitive bias that causes one's perception of another to be unduly influenced by a single negative trait.   An example of the horn effect may be that an observer is more likely to assume a physically unattractive person is morally inferior to an attractive person, despite the lack of relationship between morality and physical appearance.   The term is derived from the English[a] word "horn" and refers to the devil's horns. This is in contrast to the word halo and the halo effect, based on the concept of a saint's halo. In a 1920 study published by Thorndike  that focused on the halo effect, it was noted that "ratings were apparently affected by a marked tendency to think of the person in general as rather good or rather inferior [b] and to color the judgments of the qualities by this general feeling".[c] It is sometimes called the horns effect,  reverse-halo effect, or devil effect. The horn effect occurs when "individuals believe that negative traits are connected to each other."  It is a phenomenon in which an observer's judgment of a person is adversely affected by the presence of (for the observer) an unfavorable aspect of this person.
