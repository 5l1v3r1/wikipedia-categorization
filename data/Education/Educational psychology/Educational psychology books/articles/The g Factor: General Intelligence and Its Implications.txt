The g Factor: General Intelligence and Its Implications is a book by Christopher Brand, a psychologist and lecturer at the University of Edinburgh. It was published by John Wiley & Sons in the United Kingdom in March 1996. The book was "depublished" by the publishing house on April 17, which cited "deep ethical beliefs" in its decision to remove the book from circulation; it is generally agreed that material in the book that covered racial issues in intelligence testing was responsible for the withdrawal. Wiley argued that after "inflammatory statements" Brand had made elsewhere, it was possible to "infer some of the same repugnant views from the text". According to economist Edward M. Miller, "While Wiley has not been specific as to just what views that were trying to prevent the dissemination of, one presumes they have to do with racial differences in intelligence and the implications for economics and educational policy."  In a different review, H.J. Eysenck (Personality and Individual Differences, Vol. 21, No. 5, 1996) wrote concerning the decision by Wiley: While Eysenck chose to highlight connections between Brand's book and that of Herrnstein and Murray, an editorial in New Scientist took issue with the comparison and criticized both Brand's research and Wiley's decision: The text of the book has been released as an electronic download by Philippe Gouillou.
