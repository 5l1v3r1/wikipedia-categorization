Both Dewey and Piaget were very influential in the development of informal education. Dewey's idea of influential education suggests that education must engage with and enlarge experience and the exploration of thinking and reflection associated with the role of educators.  Piaget's role in the constructivist teaching suggests that we learn by expanding our knowledge by experiences which are generated through play from infancy to adulthood which are necessary for learning. Their theories are now encompassed in the broader movement of <a href=\"/wiki/Progressive_education\" title=\"Progressive education\">progressive education</a>. Constructivist learning theory says that all knowledge is constructed from a base of prior knowledge. Children are not a blank slate and knowledge cannot be imparted without the child making sense of it according to his or her current conceptions.

Some activities encouraged in constructivist classrooms are:\n</p>\n<ul><li><b>Experimentation:</b> Students individually perform an experiment and then come together as a class to discuss the results.</li>\n<li><b>Research projects:</b> Students research a topic and can present their findings to the class.</li>\n<li><b>Field trips:</b>  This allows students to put the concepts and ideas discussed in class in a real-world context.

Thus, the teacher's main focus should be on guiding students by asking questions that will lead them to develop their own conclusions on the subject. Parker J. Palmer (1997) suggests that good teachers join self, subject, and students in the fabric of life because they teach from an integral and undivided self, they manifest in their own lives, and evoke in their students, a capacity for connectedness\".\n</p><p>David Jonassen identified three major roles for facilitators to support students in constructivist learning environments:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Modeling</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Coaching\" title=\"Coaching\">Coaching</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Instructional_scaffolding\" title=\"Instructional scaffolding\">Scaffolding</a><sup id=\"cite_ref-Jonassen_5-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Jonassen-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup></li></ul>\n<p>A brief description of the Jonassen major roles are:\n</p><p><b>Modeling</b> \u2013 Jonassen describes Modeling as the most commonly used instructional strategy in CLEs. Two types of modeling exist: behavioural modeling of the overt performance and cognitive modeling of the covert cognitive processes. Behavioural modeling in Constructivist Learning Environments demonstrates how to perform the activities identified in the activity structure. Cognitive modeling articulates the reasoning (reflection-in-action) that learners should use while engaged in the activities.\n</p><p><b>Coaching</b> \u2013 For Jonassen the role of coach is complex and inexact. She acknowledges that a good coach motivates learners, analyzes their performance, provides feedback and advice on the performance and how to learn about how to perform, and provokes reflection and articulation of what was learned. Moreover, she posits that coaching may be solicited by the learner. Students seeking help might press a \"How am I Doing?\" button. Or coaching may be unsolicited, when the coach observes the performance and provides encouragement, diagnosis, directions, and feedback. Coaching naturally and necessarily involves responses that are situated in the learner's task performance (Laffey, Tupper, Musser, &amp; Wedman, 1997).\n</p><p><b>Scaffolding</b> - Scaffolding is a more systemic approach to supporting the learner, focusing on the task, the environment, the teacher, and the learner. Scaffolding provides temporary frameworks to support learning and student performance beyond their capacities. The concept of scaffolding represents any kind of support for cognitive activity that is provided by an adult when the child and adult are performing the task together (Wood &amp; Middleton, 1975).\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Constructivist_learning_environments_.28CLEs.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Constructivist_learning_environments_(CLEs)\">Constructivist learning environments (CLEs)</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Constructivist_teaching_methods&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Constructivist learning environments (CLEs)\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Jonassen has proposed a model for developing constructivist learning environments (CLEs) around a specific learning goal. This goal may take one of several forms, from least to most complex:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Question or issue</li>\n<li>Case study</li>\n<li>Long-term Project</li>\n<li>Problem (multiple cases and projects integrated at the curriculum level)</li></ul>\n<p>Jonassen recommends making the learning goals engaging and relevant but not overly structured.\n</p><p>In CLEs, learning is driven by the problem to be solved; students learn content and theory in order to solve the problem. This is different from traditional objectivist teaching where the theory would be presented first and problems would be used afterwards to practice theory.\n</p><p>Depending on students' prior experiences, related cases and scaffolding may be necessary for support. Instructors also need to provide an authentic context for tasks, plus information resources, cognitive tools, and collaborative tools.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Jonassen_5-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Jonassen-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Assessment\">Assessment</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Constructivist_teaching_methods&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Assessment\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Traditionally, assessment in the classrooms is based on testing.  In this style, it is important for the student to produce the correct answers.  However, in constructivist teaching, the process of gaining knowledge is viewed as being just as important as the product.  Thus, assessment is based not only on tests, but also on observation of the student, the student's work, and the student's points of view.<sup id=\"cite_ref-thirteenorg_1-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-thirteenorg-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>  Some assessment strategies include:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Oral discussions.  The teacher presents students with a \"focus\" question and allows an open discussion on the topic.</li>\n<li>KWL(H) Chart (What we know, What we want to know, What we have learned, How we know it).  This technique can be used throughout the course of study for a particular topic, but is also a good assessment technique as it shows the teacher the progress of the student throughout the course of study.</li>\n<li>Mind Mapping.  In this activity, students list and categorize the concepts and ideas relating to a topic.</li>\n<li>Hands-on activities.  These encourage students to manipulate their environments or a particular learning tool.  Teachers can use a checklist and observation to assess student success with the particular material.</li>\n<li>Pre-testing.  This allows a teacher to determine what knowledge students bring to a new topic and thus will be helpful in directing the course of study.<sup id=\"cite_ref-templeedu_2-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-templeedu-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"An_example_of_a_lesson_taught_with_a_Constructivist_background\">An example of a lesson taught with a Constructivist background</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Constructivist_teaching_methods&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: An example of a lesson taught with a Constructivist background\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>A good example of a lesson being taught in a constructivist way, with the teacher mediating learning rather than directly teaching the class is shown by the example of <a href=\"/wiki/Michael_Faraday\" title=\"Michael Faraday\">Faraday</a>'s <a href=\"/wiki/The_Chemical_History_of_a_Candle\" title=\"The Chemical History of a Candle\">candle</a>. There are various forms of this lesson, but all are developed from the Christmas lectures Faraday gave on the functioning of candles. In open constructivist lessons using these lectures as a basis, students are encouraged to discover for themselves how candles work. They do this first by making simple observations, from which they later build ideas and hypotheses which they then go on to test. The teacher acts to encourage this learning. If successful, students can use this lesson to understand the components of combustion, an important chemistry topic.<sup id=\"cite_ref-faraday_6-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-faraday-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Constructivism_for_adults\">Constructivism for adults</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Constructivist_teaching_methods&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: Constructivism for adults\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Constructivist philosophy has a long history of application in education programs for young children, but is used less frequently in adult learning environments. As humans develop,  there are qualitative changes in their ability to think logically about experiences, but the processes by which learning occurs, <a href=\"/wiki/Jean_Piaget\" title=\"Jean Piaget\">cognitive adaptation</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Vygotsky\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Vygotsky\">social mediation</a>, are believed to be continuous or remain the same throughout the life.<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> At the heart of constructivist philosophy is the belief that knowledge is not given but gained through real experiences that have purpose and meaning to the learner, and the exchange of perspectives about the experience with others<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> (<a href=\"/wiki/Jean_Piaget\" title=\"Jean Piaget\">Piaget</a> &amp; Inhelder, 1969; <a href=\"/wiki/Vygotsky\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Vygotsky\">Vygotsky</a>,1978).\n</p><p>Learning environments for adults based on constructivist philosophy include opportunities for students to make meaningful connections between new material and previous experience, through discovery. One of the simplest ways to do this is asking <a href=\"/wiki/Closed-ended_question\" title=\"Closed-ended question\">open-ended questions</a>. Open-ended questions such as \"Tell me about a time when... .\" or \"How might this information be useful to you?\" cause learners to think about how new information may relate to their own experience.  Student responses to such questions are opportunities for experiencing the perspectives of others.  For these questions to be effective it is critical that instructors focus on teaching content that is useful for participants.  The importance of using these types of strategies with adults contributes to what<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> Bain(2004 p.&#160;4) noted as critical learning environments where instructors \"embed\" the skills they are teaching in \"authentic tasks that will arouse curiosity, challenge students to rethink assumptions and examine their mental modes of reality\". Mezirow J. (1997) who asserts that learners need to practice in recognizing frames of reference and using their imaginations to redefine problems from different perspectives. (pg. 10) I made the connection by also adding the point that \"to promote discovery learning, the educator often reframes learner questions in terms of the learner's current level of understanding. Learning contracts, group projects, role play, case studies, and simulations are classroom methods associated with transformative education.\" Such approaches emphasize that learning is not an \"all or nothing\" process but that students learn the new information that is presented to them by building upon knowledge that they already possess.  It is therefore important that teachers constantly assess the knowledge their students have gained to make sure that the students' perceptions of the new knowledge are what the teacher had intended.  Teachers will find that since the students build upon already existing knowledge, when they are called upon to retrieve the new information, they may make errors.  It is known as reconstruction error when we fill in the gaps of our understanding with logical, though incorrect, thoughts.  Teachers need to catch and try to correct these errors, though it is inevitable that some reconstruction error will continue to occur because of our innate retrieval limitations.\n</p><p>In most pedagogies based on constructivism, the teacher's role is not only to observe and assess but to also engage with the students while they are completing activities, wondering aloud and posing questions to the students for promotion of <a href=\"/wiki/Reasoning\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Reasoning\">reasoning</a> (DeVries et al., 2002).  (ex: I wonder why the water does not spill over the edge of the full cup?)  Teachers also intervene when there are conflicts that arise; however, they simply facilitate the students' resolutions and <a href=\"/wiki/Self-control\" title=\"Self-control\">self-regulation</a>, with an emphasis on the conflict being the students' and that they must figure things out for themselves. For example, promotion of literacy is accomplished by integrating the need to read and write throughout individual activities within print-rich classrooms.  The teacher, after reading a story, encourages the students to write or draw stories of their own, or by having the students reenact a story that they may know well, both activities encourage the students to <i>conceive themselves</i> as reader and writers.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Arguments_against_constructivist_teaching_techniques\">Arguments against constructivist teaching techniques</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Constructivist_teaching_methods&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10\" title=\"Edit section: Arguments against constructivist teaching techniques\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Constructivism_(learning_theory)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Constructivism (learning theory)\">Constructivism (learning theory)</a></div>\n<p>Critics have voiced the following arguments against constructivist based teaching instruction:\n</p>\n<ul><li>A group of cognitive scientists has also questioned the central claims of constructivism, saying that they are either misleading or contradict known findings.<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup></li>\n<li>One possible deterrent for this teaching method is that, due to the emphasis on group work, the ideas of the more active students may dominate the group's conclusions.<sup id=\"cite_ref-thirteenorg_1-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-thirteenorg-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup></li></ul>\n<p>While proponents of constructivism argue that constructivist students perform better than their peers when tested on higher-order reasoning, the critics of constructivism argue that this teaching technique forces students to \"<a href=\"/wiki/Reinventing_the_wheel\" title=\"Reinventing the wheel\">reinvent the wheel</a>\".

In developing this instruction these educators produce materials that require learning to be behaviorally active and not be \"cognitively active\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-Mayer_11-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Mayer-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> That is, although they are engaged in activity, they may not be learning (Sweller, 1988).

Specifically, they say instructors often design unguided instruction that relies on the learner to \"discover or construct essential information for themselves\" (Kirchner et al., 2006, p75).\n</p><p>For this reason they state that it \"is easy to agree with Mayer's (2004)<sup id=\"cite_ref-Mayer_11-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Mayer-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> recommendation that we \"move educational reform efforts from the fuzzy and nonproductive world of ideology\u2014which sometimes hides under the various banners of constructivism\u2014to the sharp and productive world of theory-based research on how people learn\" (p.&#160;18).

In this approach, the individual is consciously engaged in the construction of a product (Li, Cheng, &amp; Liu, 2013). The utilization of constructionism in educational settings has been shown to promote higher-order thinking skills such as problem-solving and critical thinking (Li et al., 2013).\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Guided_instruction\">Guided instruction</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Constructivist_teaching_methods&amp;action=edit&amp;section=13\" title=\"Edit section: Guided instruction\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>A learning approach in which the educator uses strategically placed prompts, cues, questions, direct explanations, and modeling to guide student thinking and facilitate an increased responsibility for the completion of a task (Fisher &amp; Frey, 2010).\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Problem-based_learning\">Problem-based learning</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Constructivist_teaching_methods&amp;action=edit&amp;section=14\" title=\"Edit section: Problem-based learning\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>A structured educational approach which consists of large and small group discussions (Schmidt &amp; Loyens, 2007). <a href=\"/wiki/Problem-based_learning\" title=\"Problem-based learning\">Problem-based learning</a> begins with an educator presenting a series of carefully constructed problems or issues to small groups of students (Schmidt &amp; Loyens, 2007).  The problems or issues typically pertain to phenomena or events to which students possess limited prior knowledge (Schmidt &amp; Loyens, 2007). The first component of problem-based learning is to discuss prior knowledge and ask questions related to the specific problems or issues (Schmidt &amp; Loyens, 2007). Following the class discussion, there is typically time in which students individually research or reflect on the newly acquired information and/or seek out areas requiring further exploration (Schmidt &amp; Loyens, 2007). After a pre-determined amount of time (as outlined by the educator), students will meet in the same small groups that were composed prior to the class discussion (Schmidt &amp; Loyens, 2007). In the first meeting, groups will spend between one and three hours further discussing the problems or issues from class in addition to presenting any new information collected during individual research (Schmidt &amp; Loyens, 2007). Following the first meeting, students will independently reflect on the group discussion, specifically in comparing thoughts regarding the problems or issues in question (Schmidt &amp; Loyens, 2007). Typically, groups will meet a second time to critically analyse individual and group thoughts and discussions and will attempt to synthesize the information in order to draw conclusions about the given problem or issue (Schmidt &amp; Loyens, 2007).  Within the educational setting, problem-based learning has enabled students to actively construct individual understandings of a topic using both prior and newly acquired knowledge (Schmidt &amp; Loyens, 2007). Moreover, students also develop self-directed and group learning skills which ultimately facilitates the comprehension of the problems or issues (Schmidt &amp; Loyens, 2007).\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Inquiry-based_learning\">Inquiry-based learning</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Constructivist_teaching_methods&amp;action=edit&amp;section=15\" title=\"Edit section: Inquiry-based learning\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>An educational approach associated with problem-based learning in which the student learns through investigating issues or scenarios (Hakverdi-Can &amp; Sonmez, 2012). In this approach, students pose and answer questions individually and/or collaboratively in order to draw conclusions regarding the specific issues or scenarios (Hakverdi-Can &amp; Sonmez, 2012). Within the educational setting, <a href=\"/wiki/Inquiry-based_learning\" title=\"Inquiry-based learning\">inquiry-based learning</a> has been beneficial in developing student inquiry, investigation, and collaboration skills, in turn, increasing overall comprehension of the issue or scenario (Hakverdi-Can &amp; Sonmez, 2012).\n</p><p>Effective essential questions include student thought and research, connect to student's reality and can be solved in different ways (Crane, 2009).  There are no incorrect answers to essential questions, rather answers reveal student understanding(Crane, 2009).\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Anchored_instruction\">Anchored instruction</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Constructivist_teaching_methods&amp;action=edit&amp;section=16\" title=\"Edit section: Anchored instruction\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>An educational approach associated with problem-based learning in which the educator introduces an 'anchor' or theme in which students will be able to explore (Kariuki &amp; Duran, 2004). The 'anchor' acts as a focal point for the entire task, allowing students to identify, define, and explore problems while exploring the topic from a variety of different perspectives (Kariuki &amp; Duran, 2004).\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Cooperative_learning\">Cooperative learning</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Constructivist_teaching_methods&amp;action=edit&amp;section=17\" title=\"Edit section: Cooperative learning\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>A variety of educational approaches focusing on individuals working together to achieve a specific learning outcome (Hsiung, 2012). \n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Reciprocal_Peer_Teaching\">Reciprocal Peer Teaching</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Constructivist_teaching_methods&amp;action=edit&amp;section=18\" title=\"Edit section: Reciprocal Peer Teaching\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>A <a href=\"/wiki/Cooperative_learning\" title=\"Cooperative learning\">cooperative learning</a> approach wherein students alternate roles as teacher and learner (Krych, March, Bryan, Peake, Wojciech, &amp; Carmichael, 2005). The utilization of Reciprocal Peer Teaching (RPT) in educational settings has been effective in the development of teamwork, leadership, and communication skills in addition to improving students' understanding of course content (Krych et al., 2005).\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Jigsaw\">Jigsaw</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Constructivist_teaching_methods&amp;action=edit&amp;section=19\" title=\"Edit section: Jigsaw\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Jigsaw_(teaching_technique)\" title=\"Jigsaw (teaching technique)\">Jigsaw (teaching technique)</a></div>\n<p>A highly structured cooperative learning approach which is implemented in four stages: introduction, focused exploration, reporting and re-shaping, and integration and evaluation. In the introduction stage, the class is divided into heterogeneous 'home' groups consisting of between three and seven students (Karacop &amp; Doymus, 2013). Upon establishing the 'home' groups, the teacher will discuss the subtopics pertaining to the subject matter (Karacop &amp; Doymus, 2013). In the focused exploration stage, each student within all 'home' groups selects one of the subtopics (Karacop &amp; Doymus, 2013). Students from each 'home' group that have selected the same subtopic will form a 'jigsaw' group (Karacop &amp; Doymus, 2013). It is in the 'jigsaw' group that students will explore the material pertaining to the subtopic and will prepare for teaching it to their 'home' group, the reporting and re-shaping stage (Karacop &amp; Doymus, 2013). The approach concludes in the fourth stage, integration and evaluation, wherein each of the 'home' groups combine the learning of each subtopic together to create the completed piece of work (Karacop &amp; Doymus, 2013).\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a
