 The Centre for Cognitive Ageing and Cognitive Epidemiology (CCACE) is a "centre of excellence" to advance research into how ageing affects cognition, and how mental ability in youth affects health and longevity. Based at the University of Edinburgh and funded by the Medical Research Council (MRC), ESRC, BBSRC and EPSRC through the LLHW MRC's Lifelong Health and Wellbeing scheme, the Centre is led by Professor Ian Deary alongside 2 co-Directors and 8 Research Group Leaders spread across three University of Edinburgh sites (George Square, New Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, Western General Hospital).
