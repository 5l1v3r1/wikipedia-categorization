There are, however, no incompatibilities and most of Marzano's top-ten appear high on Hattie's list.\n</p><p>Hattie points out that there is no shortage of effective methods - almost anything you try in education seems to have a small beneficial effect. He therefore uses a scale of <i>effect size</i> which measures by how much the learning is improved. As an effect-size of 0.4 is the average for all interventions (and also the effect of a hard working, well organised and enthusiastic teacher), he suggests that methods with an effect size above 0.4 should be used as a priority. This ties with Marzano, whose list starts at an effect size of 0.59 for Advance Organisers and increases up the list.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Coalition_For_Evidence-Based_Policy_Congressional_Top_Tier_Programs\">The Coalition For Evidence-Based Policy Congressional Top Tier Programs</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Evidence-based_education&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: The Coalition For Evidence-Based Policy Congressional Top Tier Programs\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The Coalition For Evidence-Based Policy, which is a non-partisan, non-profit organization advocating the use of well conducted randomized controlled trials in policy, has recognized three educational programs as \"Top Tier\".

According to several studies,<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> the time taken to do this lies somewhere between the learning of new facts and the development of a musical or sporting skill. While facts can be learned with a few repetitions, skills may need several hundred hours to develop. The evidence is that teachers start to become skilled with a particular method after about 10 repetitions with improvement plateauing after 6 months to 2 years of use.\n<a href=\"/wiki/Continuing_professional_development\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Continuing professional development\">Continuing professional development</a> (CPD) needs to reflect these findings. Teaching staff need the opportunity to learn about and then practice these skills. The role of CPD managers is to ensure that the time is available and the process takes place, not to instruct the teachers to follow directions.\nWhere staff self-select their training either from external providers or from a range of sessions on a training day, they do not have the chance to develop their skills.  Training, development and discussion of a smaller list of high-effect-size methods will be more effective. This process is sometimes referred to as <i>supported experimentation</i> or <a href=\"/wiki/Peer_mentoring#Peer_mentoring_in_the_workplace\" title=\"Peer mentoring\">peer mentoring</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Implications_for_teachers\">Implications for teachers</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Evidence-based_education&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Implications for teachers\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Teachers have more effect on the outcomes for their students than anyone else. The difference in outcomes for 2 teachers in the same college is significantly greater than the average of teachers in a 'good' rather than a 'weak' school. The main reason why some schools do better is that they have a higher percentage of teachers who use high effect-size methods.\nWhile individual teachers can improve their students' results using these methods in isolation, it is far more effective if they are adopted department or college-wide so that the discussions, observations and sharing-of-practice can take place easily.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Evidence-based_education&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"> Zucker, S.
