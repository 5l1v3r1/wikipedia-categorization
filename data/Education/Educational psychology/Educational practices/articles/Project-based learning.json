PBL contrasts with paper-based, rote memorization, or teacher-led instruction that presents established facts or portrays a smooth path to knowledge by instead posing questions, problems or scenarios.\n</p><p>Thomas Markham (2011) describes project-based learning (PBL) thus: \"PBL integrates knowing and doing. Students learn knowledge and elements of the core curriculum, but also apply what they know to solve authentic problems and produce results that matter. PBL students take advantage of digital tools to produce high quality, collaborative products. PBL refocuses education on the student, not the curriculum\u2014a shift mandated by the global world, which rewards intangible assets such as drive, passion, creativity, empathy, and resiliency. These cannot be taught out of a textbook, but must be activated through experience.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>  James G. Greeno (2006) has associated project-based learning with the \"situated learning\" perspective<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> and with the <a href=\"/wiki/Constructivism_(philosophy_of_education)\" title=\"Constructivism (philosophy of education)\">constructivist</a> theories of <a href=\"/wiki/Jean_Piaget\" title=\"Jean Piaget\">Jean Piaget</a>. Blumenfeld <i>et al.</i> elaborate on the processes of PBL: \"Project-based learning is a comprehensive perspective focused on teaching by engaging students in investigation. Within this framework, students pursue solutions to nontrivial problems by asking and refining questions, debating ideas, making predictions, designing plans and/or experiments, collecting and analyzing data, drawing conclusions, communicating their ideas and findings to others, asking new questions, and creating artifacts.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> The basis of PBL lies in the authenticity or real-life application of the research. Students working as a team are given a \"driving question\" to respond to or answer, then directed to create an artifact (or artifacts) to present their gained knowledge. Artifacts may include a variety of media such as writings, art, drawings, three-dimensional representations, videos, photography, or technology-based presentations.\n</p><p>Proponents of project-based learning cite numerous benefits to the implementation of its strategies in the classroom \u2013  including a greater depth of understanding of concepts, broader knowledge base, improved communication and interpersonal/social skills, enhanced <a href=\"/wiki/Leadership\" title=\"Leadership\">leadership</a> skills, increased <a href=\"/wiki/Creativity\" title=\"Creativity\">creativity</a>, and improved writing skills. Another definition of project-based learning includes a type of instruction, where students work together to solve real-world problems in their schools and communities. Successful problem-solving often requires students to draw on lessons from several disciplines and apply them in a very practical way. The promise of seeing a very real impact becomes the motivation for learning.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/John_Dewey\" title=\"John Dewey\">John Dewey</a> initially promoted the idea of \"learning by doing\". In <i>My Pedagogical Creed</i> (1897) Dewey enumerated his beliefs regarding education: \"The teacher is not in the school to impose certain ideas or to form certain habits in the child, but is there as a member of the community to select the influences which shall affect the child and to assist him in properly responding to these.......I believe, therefore, in the so-called expressive or constructive activities as the centre of correlation.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>(Dewey, 1897) Educational research has advanced this idea of teaching and learning into a methodology known as \"project-based learning\".

Unlike traditional, teacher-led classroom activities, students often must organize their own work and manage their own time in a project-based class. Project-based instruction differs from traditional inquiry by its emphasis on students' collaborative or individual artifact construction to represent what is being learned.\n</p><p>Project-based learning also gives students the opportunity to explore problems and challenges that have real-world applications, increasing the possibility of long-term retention of skills and concepts.<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Elements\">Elements</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Project-based_learning&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Elements\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The core idea of project-based learning is that real-world problems capture students' interest and provoke serious thinking as the students acquire and apply new knowledge in a problem-solving context. The teacher plays the role of facilitator, working with students to frame worthwhile questions, structuring meaningful tasks, coaching both knowledge development and social skills, and carefully assessing what students have learned from the experience. Typical projects present a problem to solve (What is the best way to reduce the pollution in the schoolyard pond?) or a phenomenon to investigate (What causes rain?). PBL replaces other traditional models of instruction such as lecture, textbook-workbook driven activities and inquiry as the preferred delivery method for key topics in the curriculum. It is an instructional framework which allows teachers to facilitate  and assess  deeper understanding  rather than stand and deliver factual  information. PBL intentionally develops students' problem solving and creative making of products to communicate deeper understanding of key concepts and mastery of 21st Century essential learning skills such as critical thinking. Students become active digital researchers and assessors of their own learning when teachers guide student learning so that students learn from the project making processes. In this context, PBLs are units of self-directed learning from students' doing or making throughout the unit. PBL is not just \"an activity\" (project) that is stuck on the end of a lesson or unit.\n</p><p>Comprehensive project-based learning:\n</p>\n<ul><li>needs a climate or collaborative culture of mutual respect in the classroom in order to work well.<sup id=\"cite_ref-auto_11-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-auto-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup></li>\n<li>begins with an entry activity that serves as the advanced organizer to capture and inspire student interest.<sup id=\"cite_ref-auto_11-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-auto-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup></li>\n<li>is organized around an authentic, open-ended driving question or challenge.<sup id=\"cite_ref-auto_11-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-auto-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup></li>\n<li>creates a need to know essential content and skills and provides ways for students to resolve the need during PBL time.<sup id=\"cite_ref-auto_11-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-auto-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup></li>\n<li>benefits from collaborative  inquiry to learn, problem to solve and/or to create or make something novel <sup id=\"cite_ref-auto_11-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-auto-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup></li>\n<li>develops critical thinking, problem solving, collaboration, and various forms of communication, often known as \"21st Century Skills.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-auto_11-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-auto-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup></li>\n<li>allows an increasing degree of student voice and choice (agency) throughout the PBL unit.<sup id=\"cite_ref-auto_11-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-auto-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup></li>\n<li>incorporates feedback and revision with opportunities for self, peer and teacher assessment of content, essential deeper learning skills, student made products and PBL processes such as research and presentations.<sup id=\"cite_ref-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup></li>\n<li>results in a publicly presented product or performance.<sup id=\"cite_ref-14\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup></li>\n<li>promotes and expands student agency (voice and choice) <sup id=\"cite_ref-auto_11-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-auto-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup></li>\n<li>is enriched by integration of digital skills especially when asking students to do research, organize or make assessments of the process, 21st Century essential skills and the product.<sup id=\"cite_ref-15\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup></li>\n<li>is enhanced when teachers become facilitators and incorporate high effects instructional strategies such as metacognition, cooperative learning and graphic organizers.

Projects vary greatly in the depth of the questions explored, the clarity of the learning goals, the content and structure of the activity, and guidance from the teacher. The role of projects in the overall curriculum is also open to interpretation. Projects can guide the entire curriculum (more common in charter or other alternative schools) or simply consist of a few hands-on activities. They might be multidisciplinary (more likely in elementary schools) or single-subject (commonly science and math). Some projects involve the whole class, while others are done in small groups or individually. For example, Perrault and Albert<sup id=\"cite_ref-17\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-17\">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup> report the results of a PBL assignment in a college setting surrounding creating a communication campaign for the campus' sustainability office, finding that after project completion in small groups that the students had significantly more positive attitudes toward sustainability than prior to working on the project.\n</p><p>When PBL is used with <a href=\"/wiki/21st_century_skills\" title=\"21st century skills\">21st century tools/skills</a>, students are expected to use technology in meaningful ways to help them investigate, collaborate, analyze, synthesize and present their learning. The term IPBL (Interdisciplinary PBL) has also been used to reflect a pedagogy where an emphasis on technology and/or an interdisciplinary approach has been included.\n</p><p>An example of a school that utilizes a project-based learning curriculum is <a href=\"/wiki/Think_Global_School\" title=\"Think Global School\">Think Global School</a>. In each country <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.thinkglobalschool.org\">(THINK Global School)</a> visits, students select an interdisciplinary, project-based learning module designed to help them answer key questions about the world around them. These projects combine elements of global studies, the sciences, and literature, among other courses. Projects from past years have included recreating Homer's The Odyssey by sailing across Greece and exploring the locations and concepts central to the epic poem, and while in Kerala, India, students participated in a project-based learning module centered around blending their learning and travels into a mock business venture. The interdisciplinary project was designed to enable students to engage in the key areas of problem solving, decision making and communication \u2014 all framed by the demanding parameters of a \"<a href=\"/wiki/Shark_Tank\" title=\"Shark Tank\">Shark Tank</a>\", or \"<a href=\"/wiki/Dragons%27_Den_(UK_TV_series)\" title=\"Dragons&#39; Den (UK TV series)\">Dragon's Den</a>\" style competition.\n</p><p>Another example of applied PBL is <a href=\"/wiki/Muscatine_High_School\" title=\"Muscatine High School\">Muscatine High School</a>, located in Muscatine, Iowa. The school started the <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.g-squared.info\">G2 (Global Generation Exponential Learning)</a> which consists of middle and high school \"Schools within Schools\" that deliver the four core subject areas. At the high school level, activities may include making water purification systems, investigating service learning, or creating new bus routes. At the middle school level, activities may include researching trash statistics, documenting local history through interviews, or writing essays about a community scavenger hunt. Classes are designed to help diverse students become college and career ready after high school.\n</p><p>In 2009, The Illinois Consortium for 21st Century Schools lead by Deeper Learning author Jim Bellanca, initiated a 5-year deeper learning research project to identify the best practices and conditions among existing PBL models. In 6 pilot schools with students from the low performing to the highest performing, they piloted their findings. The goal was to test if all school/all day public schools could be transformed by  PBL as initiated in schools such as Manor New Tech, \nThis would test if traditional schools with established faculty could make such this deep shift.\n</p><p>As a result of the all school adoption of PBL in  collaborative school wide cultures, several pilot schools earned accolades as P21 Exemplar schools\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.p21exemplars/Franklin\">http://www.p21exemplars/Franklin</a>) with raised achievement results and obvious evidence of teacher practice change.  The model calls for all  teachers and administrators to engage in a multi-year professional development effort which changed school culture, teachers re designing their units of study, teachers  vetting all units and deciding which to contribute to a school based digital PBL library of unit plans and student artifacts, revisions in RTI,  revisions in teacher evaluation and in student \"grading\".as well as an upgrading of grade level PLCs. The model empowers teachers to change how they deliver instruction so that MindQuest21 PBL is the dominant model of instruction in every classroom. The model was assessed in one three school public district with a rising \"free and reduced,lunch\"  population.  Following the pilot years, the Consortium initiated this change program in Chicago Public Schools, Atlanta Public Schools, and in a rural Illinois statewide network. The P21 Exemplar school site provides videos and descriptions of the Illinois projects as well as other PBL projects across the country. \n</p><p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Bill_and_Melinda_Gates_Foundation\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation\">Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</a> has provided funding to start holistic PBL schools across the United States.

The first is Challenge-Based Learning/Problem-Based Learning, the second is Place-Based Education, and the third is Activity-Based learning. Challenge-Based Learning is \"an engaging multidisciplinary approach to teaching and learning that encourages students to leverage the technology they use in their daily lives to solve real-world problems through efforts in their homes, schools and communities.\" Place-based Education \"immerses students in local heritage, cultures, landscapes, opportunities and experiences; uses these as a foundation for the study of language arts, mathematics, social studies, science and other subjects across the curriculum, and emphasizes learning through participation in service projects for the local school and/or community.\" Activity-Based Learning takes a kind of constructivist approach, the idea being students constructing their own meaning through hands-on activities, often with manipulatives and opportunities to. As a private school provider <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Nobel_Education_Network&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Nobel Education Network (page does not exist)\">Nobel Education Network</a> combines PBL with the <a href=\"/wiki/International_Baccalaureate\" title=\"International Baccalaureate\">International Baccalaureate</a> as a central pillar of their strategy.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Roles\">Roles</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Project-based_learning&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Roles\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>PBL relies on learning groups. Student groups determine their projects, in so doing, they engage <a href=\"/wiki/Student_voice\" title=\"Student voice\">student voice</a> by encouraging students to take full responsibility for their learning. This is what makes PBL <a href=\"/wiki/Constructivist_learning\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Constructivist learning\">constructivist</a>. Students work together to accomplish specific goals.\n</p><p>When students use technology as a tool to communicate with others, they take on an active role vs. a passive role of transmitting the information by a teacher, a book, or broadcast. The student is constantly making choices on how to obtain, display, or manipulate information. Technology makes it possible for students to think actively about the choices they make and execute. Every student has the opportunity to get involved either individually or as a group.\n</p><p>Instructor role in Project Based Learning is that of a facilitator. They do not relinquish control of the classroom or student learning but rather develop an atmosphere of shared responsibility. The Instructor must structure the proposed question/issue so as to direct the student's learning toward content-based materials. The instructor must regulate student success with intermittent, transitional goals to ensure student projects remain focused and students have a deep understanding of the concepts being investigated. The students are held accountable to these goals through ongoing feedback and assessments. The ongoing assessment and feedback are essential to ensure the student stays within the scope of the driving question and the core standards the project is trying to unpack. According to Andrew Miller of the Buck Institute of Education, formative assessments are used \"in order to be transparent to parents and students, you need to be able to track and monitor ongoing formative assessments, that show work toward that standard.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-20\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-20\">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup> The instructor uses these assessments to guide the inquiry process and ensure the students have learned the required content.

Students must collaborate expanding their active listening skills and requiring them to engage in intelligent focused communication. Therefore, allowing them to think rationally on how to solve problems. PBL forces students to take ownership of their success.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Outcomes\">Outcomes</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Project-based_learning&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Outcomes\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>More important than learning science, students need to learn to work in a community, thereby taking on social responsibilities. The most significant contributions of PBL have been in schools languishing in poverty stricken areas; when students take responsibility, or ownership, for their learning, their self-esteem soars. It also helps to create better work habits and attitudes toward learning. In standardized tests, languishing schools have been able to raise their testing grades a full level by implementing PBL.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources. (December 2012)\">citation needed</span></a></i>&#93;</sup> Although students do work in groups, they also become more independent because they are receiving little instruction from the teacher. With Project-Based Learning students also learn skills that are essential in higher education. The students learn more than just finding answers, PBL allows them to expand their minds and think beyond what they normally would. Students have to find answers to questions and combine them using critically thinking skills to come up with answers.\n</p><p>PBL is significant to the study of (mis-)conceptions; local concepts and childhood intuitions that are hard to replace with conventional classroom lessons. In PBL, project science <i>is</i> the community culture; the student groups themselves resolve their understandings of phenomena with their own knowledge building. Technology allows them to search in more useful ways, along with getting more rapid results.\n</p><p>Opponents of Project Based Learning warn against negative outcomes primarily in projects that become unfocused and tangential arguing that underdeveloped lessons can result in the wasting of precious class time. No one teaching method has been proven more effective than another. Opponents suggest that narratives and presentation of anecdotal evidence included in lecture-style instruction can convey the same knowledge in less class time. Given that disadvantaged students generally have fewer opportunities to learn academic content outside of school, wasted class time due to an unfocused lesson presents a particular problem. Instructors can be deluded into thinking that as long as a student is engaged and doing, they are learning. Ultimately it is cognitive activity that determines the success of a lesson. If the project does not remain on task and content driven the student will not be successful in learning the material. The lesson will be ineffective. A source of difficulty for teachers includes, \"Keeping these complex projects on track while attending to students' individual learning needs requires artful teaching, as well as industrial-strength project management.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-21\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-21\">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup> Like any approach, Project Based Learning is only beneficial when applied successfully.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Problem-based_learning\" title=\"Problem-based learning\">Problem-based learning</a> is a similar pedagogic approach, however, problem-based approaches structure students' activities more by asking them to solve specific (open-ended) problems rather than relying on students to come up with their own problems in the course of completing a project.\n</p><p>A meta-analysis conducted by Purdue University found that when implemented well, PBL can increase long-term retention of material and replicable skill, as well as improve teachers' and students' attitudes towards learning.<sup id=\"cite_ref-22\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-22\">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Overcoming_obstacles_and_criticisms\">Overcoming obstacles and criticisms</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Project-based_learning&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Overcoming obstacles and criticisms\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>A frequent criticism of PBL is that when students work in groups some will \"slack off\" or sit back and let the others do all the work.  Anne Shaw recommends that teachers always build into the structure of the PBL curriculum an organizational strategy known as Jigsaw and Expert Groups.  This structure forces students to be self-directed, independent and to work interdependently.\n</p><p>This means that the class is assigned (preferably randomly, by lottery) to Expert Groups.  Each of the Expert Groups is then assigned to deeply study one particular facet of the overall project.  For example, a class studying about environmental issues in their community may be divided into the following Expert Groups:\n</p>\n<ol><li>Air</li>\n<li>Land</li>\n<li>Water</li>\n<li>Human impact on the environment</li></ol>\n<p>Each Expert Group is tasked with studying the materials for their group, taking notes, then preparing to teach what they learned to the rest of the students in the class.  To do so, the class will \"jigsaw\", thus creating Jigsaw Groups.  The Jigsaw Groups in the above example would each be composed of one representative from each of the Expert Groups, so each Jigsaw Group would include:\n</p>\n<ol><li>One expert on Air</li>\n<li>One expert on Land</li>\n<li>One expert on Water</li>\n<li>One expert on \"Human impact on the environment\"</li></ol>\n<p>Each of these experts would then take turns teaching the others in the group.  Total interdependence is assured.  No one can \"slack off\" because each student is the only person in the group with that \"piece\" of the information.  Another benefit is that the students must have learned the concepts, skills and information well enough to be able to teach it and must be able to assess (not grade) their own learning and the learning of their peers.  This forces a much deeper learning experience.\n</p><p>Anne Shaw recommends that when students are teaching each other they also participate collaboratively in creating a concept map as they teach each other. This adds a significant dimension to the thinking and the learning.  The students may build upon this map each time they Jigsaw.  If a project is scheduled to last over the time period of six weeks the students may meet in their Expert Groups twice a week, and then Jigsaw twice a week, building upon their learning and exploration of the topics over time.\n</p><p>Once all the experts have taught each other, the Jigsaw Group then designs and creates a product to demonstrate what they now know about all four aspects of the PBL unit \u2013 air, land, water, human's impact.  Performance-based products may include a wide range of possibilities such as dioramas, skits, plays, debates, student-produced documentaries, web sites, Glogsters, VoiceThreads, games (digital or not), presentations to members of the community (such as the City Council or a community organization), student-produced radio or television program, a student-organized conference, a fair, a film festival.\n</p><p>Students are assessed in two ways:\n</p>\n<ol><li>Individual assessments for each student \u2013 may include research notes, teaching prep notes and teacher observation.  Other assessments may include those assigned by the teacher, for example, each student in the class must write an individual research paper for a topic of their choice from within the theme of the overall PBL.</li>\n<li>Group assessments \u2013 each Jigsaw group creates and presents their product, preferably to an audience other than the teacher or their class.<sup id=\"cite_ref-23\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-23\">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup></li></ol>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Criticism\">Criticism</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Project-based_learning&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Criticism\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>One concern is that PBL may be inappropriate in mathematics, the reason being that mathematics is primarily skill-based at the elementary level. Transforming the curriculum into an over-reaching project or series of projects does not allow for necessary practice of particular mathematical skills. For instance, factoring quadratic expressions in elementary algebra requires extensive repetition.\n</p><p>On the other hand, a teacher could integrate a PBL approach into the standard curriculum, helping the students see some broader contexts where abstract quadratic equations may apply. For example, Newton's law implies that tossed objects follow a parabolic path, and the roots of the corresponding equation correspond to the starting and ending locations of the object.\n</p><p>Another criticism of PBL is that measures that are stated as reasons for its success are not measurable using standard measurement tools, and rely on subjective rubrics for assessing results.\n</p><p>In PBL there is also a certain tendency for the creation of the final product of the project to become the driving force in classroom activities. When this happens, the project can lose its content focus and be ineffective in helping students learn certain concepts and skills. For example, academic projects that culminate in an artistic display or exhibit may place more emphasis on the artistic processes involved in creating the display than on the academic content that the project is meant to help students learn.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Project-based_learning&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"div-col columns column-width\" style=\"-moz-column-width:&#32;; -webkit-column-width:&#32;; column-width:&#32;;\">*Deeper Learning\n<ul><li>MindQuest21PBL</li>\n<li>P21 Exemplar Schools: Ben Franklin Elementary School</li>\n<li>\"Kinetic Conundrum\"</li>\n<li>Read Ahead.
