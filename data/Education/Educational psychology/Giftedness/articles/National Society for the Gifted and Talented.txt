The National Society for the Gifted and Talented (NSGT) is a not-for-profit 501(c)(3) organization created to honor and encourage gifted and talented (G&T) children and youth. It is committed to acknowledging and supporting the needs of these children and youth by providing recognition of their significant academic and artistic accomplishments and access to educational resources and advanced learning opportunities directly related to their interests and talent areas. The goal of the NSGT is to provide a structure where gifted and talented children and youth are identified, and as members, can expect to find information and opportunities that directly relate to, and cultivate, their abilities and desires to achieve at a high level. NSGT collaborates closely with other gifted and talented program providers, school districts, colleges and universities, community programs, and corporations.
