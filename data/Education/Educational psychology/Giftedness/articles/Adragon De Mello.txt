 Adragon Eastwood De Mello (born October 5, 1976) graduated from the University of California, Santa Cruz with a degree in computational mathematics in 1988, at age 11. At the time, he was the youngest college graduate in U.S. history (a record since broken by Michael Kearney).   Adragon's father, Agustin Eastwood De Mello (1929â€“2003), had set the goal that his son would become a Nobel Prize laureate by age 16.  The elder De Mello was a karate master, flamenco guitarist,   and former weightlifting champion, and he vigorously mentored Adragon from an early age. In 1981, Adragon was accepted into Mensa.  After attending a series of schools for gifted children, Adragon attended Cabrillo College for two years starting in 1984.  In 1987, while at university, Adragon and his father  were interviewed by Morley Safer on 60 Minutes II.  They also appeared on 48 Hours (TV series) and The Tonight Show. While he did graduate from university in 1988, some of his math teachers later claimed that his grades were borderline.   Adragon was accepted into a graduate program at the Florida Institute of Technology.  In July 1988, his parents separated and, after a brief period in foster care, he returned to the custody of his mother, Cathy Gunn.  Although a college graduate, he  opted to enroll in Sunnyvale Junior High School (now Sunnyvale Middle School) under the assumed name of James Gunn. He found it "nice because no one knew who [he] was" and was "upset" when local papers identified him after his graduation.  In 1994, he graduated from Homestead High School. In 2000, he was training to be an estimator for a commercial painting company.  On March 15, 2001, the elder De Mello, allegedly called 4-1-1 asking for the phone number of the police and mentioning that he was dying of cancer. This led to an armed standoff with Santa Cruz police. He was subsequently charged with assault with a deadly weapon. De Mello, suffering from bladder cancer, was released to the custody of his son.    Agustin de Mello died on May 30, 2003.   As of 2003, De Mello was working for The Home Depot.  As of 2016, Adragon is married and has a young daughter.  Adragon has three half brothers fathered by Agustin - Brad Farha (b. 1962), Andre Jappen (b. 1963, d. 2015) and Pete Jappen (b. 1964).
