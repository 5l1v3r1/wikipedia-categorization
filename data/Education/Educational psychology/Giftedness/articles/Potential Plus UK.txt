Potential Plus UK, officially the National Association for Gifted Children (NAGC) is an association in the United Kingdom for gifted and talented children, and their parents. It is a registered charity under English law.  NAGC is a not-for-profit organisation that supports the social, emotional and learning needs of children with high learning potential of all ages and backgrounds.  This includes children who have been identified as gifted and talented; children who have the potential to achieve through a wide range of abilities in academic subjects, sport, the arts and leadership; those who are twice exceptional (giftedness coupled with a disability or learning difficulty) and the profoundly gifted. The aim is to enable every child with high learning potential to grow in confidence, thrive and achieve fulfilment. NAGC supports over 15,000 young people each year by providing parents, carers and professionals with the confidence and tools they need to help these children thrive.  NAGC gives them support and specialist advice covering a wide range of issues that affect some of these childrenâ€™s lives every day, such as lack of self-esteem, feelings of isolation and frustration, lack of challenge in the classroom or at home, underachievement or challenging behaviour.  In addition, NAGC provides opportunities for fun, friendship and challenge outside the classroom.
