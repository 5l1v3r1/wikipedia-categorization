Method of focal objects is technique for problem solving or creative thinking and involves synthesizing the seemingly non-matching characteristics of different objects into something new. Professor at the University of Berlin F. Kunze launched in 1926 with the first naming  'Method of catalog'. Later in 1958 American scientist C. Whiting improved and named to 'Focal Objects Method'. The steps of this method include  Â : Another way to think of focal objects is as a memory cue: if you're trying to find all the different ways to use a brick, give yourself some random "objects" (situations, concepts, etc.) and see if you can find a use.  Given "blender", for example, I would try to think of all the ways a brick could be used with a blender (as a lid?).  Another concept for the brick game: find patterns in your solutions, and then break those patterns.  If you keep finding ways to build things with bricks, think of ways to use bricks that don't involve construction.  Pattern-breaking, combined with focal object cues, can lead to very divergent solutions.  (Grind the brick up and use it as pigment?) ^ Methodology scientific and technical creativity, problem solving and decision making - Phan Dung, page 83 ^ inventive thinking through TRIZ: a practical guide - Michael A.
