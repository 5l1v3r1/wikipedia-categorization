The total time spent on each problem is equated across the conditions, and the incubation period is usually filled with unrelated activity to prevent further conscious work on the problem. Superior performance on problems for which work is split over two sessions is taken as evidence for the incubation effect, which is thus <a href=\"/wiki/Operational_definition\" title=\"Operational definition\">operationally defined</a> as any benefit of a break during problem solving.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Effects_of_emotion_and_sleep\">Effects of emotion and sleep</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Incubation_(psychology)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Effects of emotion and sleep\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>When discussing the relation between incubation effect, <a href=\"/wiki/Emotion\" title=\"Emotion\">emotions</a>, and creativity, researchers found that positive <a href=\"/wiki/Mood_(psychology)\" title=\"Mood (psychology)\">mood</a> enhances creativity at work. That means that a given day's creativity would be expected to follow reliably from the previous day's mood, above and beyond any carry-over of that previous day's mood. Theory and research on incubation, long recognized as a part of the creative process, suggest such cross-day effects. Thus, if positive mood on a particular day increases the number and scope of available thoughts, those additional thoughts may incubate overnight, increasing the probability of creative thoughts the following day.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Recent advances in <a href=\"/wiki/Neuroscience\" title=\"Neuroscience\">neuroscience</a> provide intriguing evidence of the mechanisms underlying incubation effects, particularly those that occur during <a href=\"/wiki/Sleep\" title=\"Sleep\">sleep</a>. This research reveals that people's experiences while awake can be <a href=\"/wiki/Memory_consolidation\" title=\"Memory consolidation\">consolidated</a> into <a href=\"/wiki/Memory\" title=\"Memory\">memory</a> and result in enhanced performance the next day without any additional practice or engagement in the task. Moreover, there is mounting evidence that sleep can facilitate the types of memory and <a href=\"/wiki/Learning\" title=\"Learning\">learning</a> processes, such as <a href=\"/wiki/Associative_memory_(psychology)\" title=\"Associative memory (psychology)\">associative memory</a>, that contribute to creative problem solving. In one relevant experiment, researchers demonstrated that problem-solving insight can be dramatically enhanced by a period of sleep following initial work on a problem.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources.

Water has a history of being relaxing and has been said to influence creativity. Some researchers have claimed that allowing one's mind to wander can ultimately lead to illumination. It has been suggested that <a href=\"/wiki/Archimedes\" title=\"Archimedes\">Archimedes</a>' <a href=\"/wiki/Eureka_effect\" title=\"Eureka effect\">Eureka moment</a> was as a result of incubation.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Effects_of_dreams\">Effects of dreams</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Incubation_(psychology)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Effects of dreams\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In the 1970s, <a href=\"/wiki/Stanford_University\" title=\"Stanford University\">Stanford</a> Sleep Lab Director <a href=\"/wiki/William_C._Dement\" title=\"William C. Dement\">William Dement</a> gave 500 undergraduate students three \"brain-teaser\" problems to read over before going to sleep and had them note whether they had solutions in their <a href=\"/wiki/Dream\" title=\"Dream\">dreams</a> that night; seven students had a dream containing the solution.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources.

In the August 2004 article \"Dreams: The Case Against Problem-Solving\", <a href=\"/wiki/G._William_Domhoff\" title=\"G. William Domhoff\">G. William Domhoff</a> concluded: </p><blockquote><p>When all is said and done, there is only occasional anecdotal evidence for the idea that recalled dreams have any role in solving or detecting problems. This evidence is not impressive when it is arrayed against the small percentage of dreams that are recalled and the even smaller percentage of recalled dreams that might be construed as having a solution to a problem. Dreams may on occasion be useful to waking consciousness as a basis for thinking about problems in a new way, or as a basis for discussing personal problems, as some clinical research shows (Fiss, 1991; Greenberg et al., 1992). And dreams that have a dramatic emotional impact create a strong subjective sense that they must have a useful message. However, it does not follow from clinical usefulness or a waking impression of importance that dreaming has an adaptive function (Antrobus, 1993).<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup></p></blockquote>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Incubation_(psychology)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Broaden-and-build\" title=\"Broaden-and-build\">Broaden-and-build</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Emotion_and_memory\" title=\"Emotion and memory\">Emotion and memory</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References_cited\">References cited</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Incubation_(psychology)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: References cited\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Christensen, T.
