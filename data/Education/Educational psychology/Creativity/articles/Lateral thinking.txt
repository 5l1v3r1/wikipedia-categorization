Lateral thinking is solving problems through an indirect and creative approach, using reasoning that is not immediately  obvious and involving ideas that may not be obtainable by using only traditional step-by-step logic.  The term was promulgated in 1967 by Edward de Bono. He cites as an example the Judgment of Solomon, where King Solomon resolves a dispute over the parentage of a child by calling for the child to be cut in half, and making his judgment according to the reactions that this order receives.   Edward de Bono also links lateral thinking with humour, arguing there's a switchover from a familiar pattern to a new, unexpected one.  It is in this moment of surprise that generates laughter and new insight which demonstrates an ability to see a different thought pattern that initially was not obvious.  According to de Bono, lateral thinking deliberately distances itself from the standard perception of creativity as "vertical" logic (the classic method for problem solving). To understand lateral thinking, it is necessary to compare lateral thinking and critical thinking. Critical thinking is primarily concerned with judging the true value of statements and seeking errors. Lateral thinking is more concerned with the "movement value" of statements and ideas. A person uses lateral thinking to move from one known idea to creating new ideas. Edward de Bono defines four types of thinking tools:  Quotations related to Lateral thinking at Wikiquote
