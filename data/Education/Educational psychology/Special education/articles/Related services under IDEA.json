Related services also help children with exceptionalities to reach their IEP goals and objectives.  In fact, in the IEP the related services section is located directly after the goals and objectives section.  The IEP requires the document constructor to list the service provided, the location that the service will be provided in, the frequency that the service will be provided, the projected beginning date of the service, and the anticipated duration of the service.  In order to make sure that this section of the IEP is written correctly is it essential that the service provider of the particular service either attend the IEP meeting, or send a written document describing the details of the service that will be provided.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Related_services_under_IDEA&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li>Mattson, Dr. Beverly; \"Related Services\". <i>National Dissemination Center for Children with Disabilities</i>: volume 16, 2nd edition, September 2001.</li>\n<li>Scherer, M.J. \"Connecting to Learn,\" American Psychological Association Books, 2005.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Resources\">Resources</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Related_services_under_IDEA&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Resources\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Matching_Person_%26_Technology_Model\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Matching Person &amp; Technology Model\">Matching Person &amp; Technology Model</a></li></ul>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw1231\nCached time: 20180908104251\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.012 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.011 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 9/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 0/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:5082241-0!canonical and timestamp 20180908104251 and revision id 815168427\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[{"lang":"ar","url":"https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%AE%D8%AF%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%AA_%D8%B0%D8%A7%D8%AA_%D8%B5%D9%84%D8%A9_%D9%81%D9%8A_%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%88%D9%86_%D8%AA%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%85_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%81%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AF_%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%82%D9%8A%D9%86","langname":"Arabic","autonym":"\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629","*":"\u062e\u062f\u0645\u0627\u062a \u0630\u0627\u062a \u0635\u0644\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0642\u0627\u0646\u0648\u0646 \u062a\u0639\u0644\u064a\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0641\u0631\u0627\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u0627\u0642\u064a\u0646"}],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","*":"Special_education"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Special_education_in_the_United_States"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Individuals with Disabilities Education Act"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Matching Person & Technology Model"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Special education"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"United States"}],"templates":[],"images":[],"externallinks":[],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"References","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Related_services_under_IDEA","byteoffset":2458,"anchor":"References"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Resources","number":"2","index":"2","fromtitle":"Related_services_under_IDEA","byteoffset":2711,"anchor":"Resources"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Related services under IDEA","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q7310690"}]}}
