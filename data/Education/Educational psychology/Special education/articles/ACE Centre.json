During MEP four <a href=\"/wiki/Special_education\" title=\"Special education\">Special Education</a> Micro-technology Resource Centres (SEMERCs) were set up in London (Redbridge), Manchester, Bristol and Newcastle. A special education <a href=\"/wiki/Software_engineering\" title=\"Software engineering\">software development</a> centre was also established in Manchester.  It was felt that those pupils with severe language or physical disabilities required more specialist support.\n</p><p>This idea for the first ACE centre to support these students came from Tim Southgate (Head of Ormerod Special School) and Prue Fuller, a teacher at the school. They were inspired by the computer research of Patrick Poon at the school. The original staff at the opening of the Centre in May 1984 were Prue Fuller (Director), Andrew Lysley (SEN Teacher), David Colven (Technical Officer) and Pauline Paine (Administrator).  The Centre was managed by Mary Hope at MESU, a post that was later taken over by Tina Detheridge now of Wigit Software.\n</p><p>It was essentially a project under the management of MESU (Micro Electronics Support Unit) a government quango which later merged with CET (Centre for <a href=\"/wiki/Educational_technology\" title=\"Educational technology\">Educational Technology</a>) to become NCET (the National Centre for Educational Technology). This eventually became Becta (British Educational Communications and Technology Agency) in 1998.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In 1985 a second Centre was opened in <a href=\"/wiki/Oldham\" title=\"Oldham\">Oldham</a>  at Park Dean School It was managed by the head teacher Rhys Williams, who later became principal of Hereward College, and Roger Bates (now of Inclusive Technology).  The first Director proper of ACE Oldham as it was then was Steve Broadbent.  The two Centres in Oldham and Oxford service the north and south of England and Wales respectively.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"History\">History</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=ACE_Centre&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: History\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><b>Location</b>\nThe ACE Center was housed in a spare classroom at Ormerod special school in <a href=\"/wiki/Headington\" title=\"Headington\">Headington, Oxford</a> .  Later it moved to temporary buildings on the same site and remained there until the new 'Wooden Spoon' building was erected on <a href=\"/wiki/Nuffield_Orthopaedic_Centre\" title=\"Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre\">Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre</a> site in 1998.  The new 'Wooden Spoon' building was largely funded by the Wooden Spoon Society<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> and was officially opened by <a href=\"/wiki/Anne,_Princess_Royal\" title=\"Anne, Princess Royal\">Princess Anne</a> in April 1999. The new building has custom build facilities for assessment and training.\n</p><p><b>Staff</b>\nIt has occupational therapists, speech and language Therapists, special needs and mainstream teachers, assistive technology specialists and support staff.  Early members of staff were Caroline Gray (<a href=\"/wiki/Occupational_therapist\" title=\"Occupational therapist\">occupational therapist</a>), Gillian Hazell (the Nelms, Speech and Language Therapist) and Mark Saville (web page and publications creator).\n</p><p>Prue Fuller retired as director in 1999 and was later awarded an MBE for her services to Assistive and Alternative Communication.  She was also bi-annual president of ISAAC 1998 - 2000.  Caroline Grey became director of the ACE Centre following Prue's retirement until she retired in 2007.  Liz Tapper took over as temporary director until September 2008 and Dr Ben Janubi has been in post since January 2009.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p><b>The CAP Project</b> This was a government initiative to boost the support and provision of communication aids to school students.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>  The ACE Centres were two of the organisations involved with assessment for this project.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources.

During this time the staffing in the centre increased considerably to cope with the assessment demand.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Software_developments\">Software developments</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=ACE_Centre&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Software developments\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The first software developments at the ace centre was to re-write Sentence Scan and Start-Write for the increasingly popular <a href=\"/wiki/BBC_Micro\" title=\"BBC Micro\">BBC Micro</a>.  Sentence scan was a switch or keyboard accessible sentence builder with speech support.  Sentences could be built up from sets of stored words or phrases.  Start-Write was a letter/keyboard based program with speech support and sophisticated user support configurations.  Staff from the Centre also contributed to the design of the programs such as 'Prompt Writer' and 'Concept', being created by the Special Needs Software Centre based at the Manchester SEMERC managed by Dave King.\n</p><p>The advent of the <a href=\"/wiki/IBM_PC_compatible\" title=\"IBM PC compatible\">IBM compatible</a> computer lead to more graphics based programs being developed for switch users such as 'Plocka' (Swedish for 'pick up').  Plocka has facilities for creating sorting and matching scenarios for switch users and has a built in <a href=\"/wiki/Graphics_library\" title=\"Graphics library\">graphics library</a>.\n</p>\n<ul><li>AccessMaths is a program developed for students that need to create geometric drawings but cannot manipulate a mouse. Users can use a laptop keyboard only to produce accurate and detailed mathematical constructions and drawings. Switch users can also manipulate the program via programs like 'The Grid 2' and 'SAW' (see below). It was originally developed on the BBC Master computer but later versions were created for use in <a href=\"/wiki/Microsoft_Windows\" title=\"Microsoft Windows\">Windows 3</a> and later.  The current version is version 4 which is available in English, Swedish and French.  Number Navigator is also a maths based utility which enables students to do 'sums' within a formatted grid.</li>\n<li>SAW (Special Access to Windows) is a program that was created from a grant from the then <a href=\"/wiki/Department_of_Trade_and_Industry_(United_Kingdom)\" title=\"Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)\">Department of Trade and Industry</a> to enable switch users to manipulate mathematical equations on screen.  It was quickly realised that creating a programmable scanning on-screen keyboard for Windows (version 3 at the time,) the full functionality of what they were hoping to create - and much more - could be realised by using other programs such as 'MathType'.  These programmable on-screen keyboards (selection sets) are now available for a number of very different applications.  SAw 5 is now an <a href=\"/wiki/Open_source\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Open source\">open source</a> program available from the <a href=\"/wiki/OATS\" title=\"OATS\">Oatsoft web site</a>.</li>\n<li>Hotspots - This program has similar user characteristics to SAW, but is designed for <a href=\"/wiki/Point-and-click\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Point-and-click\">point and click</a> environments.  In addition to scanning user defined spots on the screen it can annotate these with sounds, images and text.  It is easy to make simple software switch accessible.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Publications\">Publications</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=ACE_Centre&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Publications\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The Ace Centre has published a number of reviews, guides, and 'how to' documents over the years. as well as contributing articles to conferences and <a href=\"/wiki/Peer_review\" title=\"Peer review\">peer reviewed</a> journals.
