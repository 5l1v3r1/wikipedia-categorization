After contacting <a href=\"/wiki/Samuel_Orton\" title=\"Samuel Orton\">Dr. Samuel T. Orton</a>, a noted New York physician who had done pioneering work in the area of <a href=\"/wiki/Dyslexia\" title=\"Dyslexia\">dyslexia</a>, Gow began development of the Reconstructive Language methodology that has been the backbone of the Gow School program since its founding.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Gow:_A_Father,_A_Son,_A_School_2-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Gow:_A_Father,_A_Son,_A_School-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>For several years Gow held a summer school for selected students on property he had purchased in South Wales,<sup id=\"cite_ref-Gow:_A_Father,_A_Son,_A_School_2-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Gow:_A_Father,_A_Son,_A_School-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> and in 1926 he took the risk of starting a boarding school for a handful of boys. Over the years the school grew, although a school of small size and intimate, structured community was felt by Gow to be an ideal environment for the remediation of dyslexia and the development of habits of mind that would help students compensate for their language difficulties.\n</p><p>After Gow died in 1958, Norman W. Howard became headmaster, serving until the early 1980s. During the period of Howard's headship the school passed from proprietary ownership by Howard and David W. Gow, the founder's son, into the control of a board of trustees as a non-profit institution. A program of campus development was begun with the construction of the Isaac Arnold Library, named for the school's first board chair.\n</p><p>With Norman Howard's retirement, David W. Gow became headmaster. During the period of his leadership, a vigorous building and academic development program was undertaken, with the school growing from about 116 students to over 150. A new gymnasium, study hall-classroom building, and dormitory were completed before Gow's retirement in 1991. David Gow remained active in the school community until his death on December 19, 2011. \t\n</p><p>Under the next headmasters, J. William Adams and William Patterson, campus development continued with the construction of Warner House, a new dormitory with two faculty residences, and The Gow Center, a gymnasium and recreational complex. At the same time, the school continued the acquisition of land in South Wales that had begun under David Gow.\n</p><p>In 2004, M. Bradley Rogers became the school's sixth headmaster. In his first years as the school's leader, such notable developments occurred as the transformation of the original gymnasium into the state-of-the-art George Reid Art Center. The school's educational reach has continued to grow, with the school welcoming a growing population of international students as well as the traditional contingent of students from throughout North America.\n</p><p>The Gow School continues to be preeminent as a college preparatory school for dyslexic students. Its methods, still based on the work of Peter Gow Jr. and <a href=\"/wiki/Samuel_Orton\" title=\"Samuel Orton\">Dr. Samuel T. Orton</a>, remain highly regarded among educators in the field of reading and literacy.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Campus\">Campus</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=The_Gow_School&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Campus\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The Gow School campus consists of 120-acre (0.5&#160;km<sup>2</sup>) of woodlands in South Wales, NY. There are six dormitories (Rogers Ivie House, Ellis House, Cornwall House, Templeton House, Whitcomb House and Warner House), six academic buildings (Main Building, Isaac Arnold Library, Orton Hall, Reid Art Center and Wolbach Science Building and The Alice R.

Reconstructive Language, Gow's core reading program, is mandatory at each grade level. Graduation requirements consist of four credits in English, three in History, three in Mathematics, three in Science (two in a laboratory science), one and a half credits in Visual and Performing Arts, and one half credit in Health. A variety of electives are offered, including Spanish, Journalism, Economics, American Perspectives, Calculus, Advanced Biology and Physics, Robotics, Business Seminar, Computer Graphics, Advanced 2D and 3D Art, Theater, and Vocal and Instrumental Music.\n</p><p>Technology plays a central role in Gow\u2019s academic program. A school wide laptop program was introduced in 2006, and assistive technology, including Kurzweil text-to-speech software, is incorporated across the curriculum. Gow is one of the few secondary schools in North America which has a <a href=\"/wiki/CNC_router\" title=\"CNC router\">CNC router</a>\u2014a complex milling machine that is used in the fabrication of the robots constructed each year by the robotics team.\n</p><p>For students requiring additional support, individualized <a href=\"/wiki/Executive_functions\" title=\"Executive functions\">Executive Functions</a> Coaching is provided.

Other selections include: cross country, volleyball, golf (All Catholics 2015,2016), squash, wrestling, ski racing, tennis and Outdoor Education. Students also may participate in an intramural program and/or weight training. Athletic fields and a 49,500 square foot athletic facility provide ample space for competing and training. During the winter months, two local resorts, Kissing Bridge and Holiday Valley, provide the opportunity for intramural and competitive skiing. The current Athletic Director for The Gow School is Mark Szafnicki.\n</p><p>In addition to the athletic options, students can choose to participate in drama, which is offered 2 out of the 3 seasons every year. Students perform plays that are directed by Joseph Brognano. The sets are designed by students.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Notable_alumni\">Notable alumni</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=The_Gow_School&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Notable alumni\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Brooks_McCabe\" title=\"Brooks McCabe\">Brooks McCabe</a> \u201966, West Virginia State Senator</li>\n<li>Edward \u201cTrey\u201d Roski \u201984, Co-creator of <a href=\"/wiki/BattleBots\" title=\"BattleBots\">BattleBots</a></li>\n<li>Brian Talma \u201984, Olympic windsurfer, member of Professional Windsurfing Association (PWA) World Tour, Barbados Service Star recipient</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Quinn_Bradlee\" title=\"Quinn Bradlee\">Quinn Bradlee</a> '02, learning disabilities advocate; son of <a href=\"/wiki/Ben_Bradlee\" title=\"Ben Bradlee\">Ben Bradlee</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Sally_Quinn\" title=\"Sally Quinn\">Sally Quinn</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=The_Gow_School&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-Official_Website-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-Official_Website_1-0\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.gow.org\">http://www.gow.org</a></span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-Gow:_A_Father,_A_Son,_A_School-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\">^ <a href=\"#cite_ref-Gow:_A_Father,_A_Son,_A_School_2-0\"><sup><i><b>a</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Gow:_A_Father,_A_Son,_A_School_2-1\"><sup><i><b>b</b></i></sup></a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Gow, David, W.
