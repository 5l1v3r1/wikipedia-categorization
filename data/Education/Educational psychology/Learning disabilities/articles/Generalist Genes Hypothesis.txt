The Generalist Genes Hypothesis of learning abilities and disabilities was conceived by Professor Robert Plomin, one of the 100 most eminent psychologists of the 20th century.  The term was originally coined in an article by Plomin & Kovas (2005),  published in Psychological Bulletin, one of the leading psychology journals (according to Web of Scienceâ€™s Journal Citation Reports). The Generalist Genes Hypothesis suggests that most genes associated with common learning disabilities and abilities are generalist in three ways. The Generalist Genes Hypothesis has important implications for education, cognitive sciences and molecular genetics.
