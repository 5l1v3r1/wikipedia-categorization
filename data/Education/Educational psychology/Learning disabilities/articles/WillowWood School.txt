WillowWood School is an alternative private school in Toronto, Ontario, Canada offering an Ontario Ministry of Education-inspected Grades 1 through 12 program.  It was founded in 1980 by owner/principal Joy Kurtz. WillowWood teaches, and has always taught, children and teens as individuals, taking into consideration the style, level and strengths of each student. For this reason, WillowWood does very well for children with learning differences, ADHD, and other learning challenges, as well as those who enjoy smaller classes, individual support, and a warm atmosphere.  WillowWood has robust Arts and Sports programs. Two dramatic presentations happen annually: the Holiday Happening in December, and the Musical in the Spring. WillowWood sports teams participate in the SSAF (Small Schools Athletic Federation) as the WillowWood Warriors.  WillowWood was opened in 1980 by Joy Kurtz and Heather Spear. The two teachers had developed a unique approach to teaching while working across the hallway from each other in  the 1970s: by combining the needs of students in the special education program and those of the general population of students, the two had honed the individualized approach to education still employed at WillowWood today.  In 1989, Heather Spear opened Northwood Academy - a preschool and kindergarten - which has grown and expanded over the decades, and has five locations in the GTA to date. Joy Kurtz continues to run WillowWood as director and co-principal.  The new location is now home to a full and vibrant community, with programs developing and growing every year - the sports, dramatic productions, computer technology and music have all come a long way since 1997.
