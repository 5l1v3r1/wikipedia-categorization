Quinn Josiah Crowninshield Bradlee FRSA,  FSA Scot, MStJ  (born 29 April 1982) is an American filmmaker, author and advocate for improving the lives of disabled individuals.       Bradlee is the son of the late author and Washington Post executive editor Ben Bradlee, and author and journalist Sally Quinn.    He was diagnosed in 1996 with DiGeorge syndrome.     He attended The Lab School of Washington,   and graduated from the college-preparatory Gow School in 2002.   He attended special programs at Landmark College and American University, and studied at the New York Film Academy.  He is the producer of several documentary films including the 2007 film Life with VCFS about the syndrome and the VCFS International Center at Upstate Medical University,   and is the associate producer of the 2010 HBO Family documentary film I Can't Do This But I CAN Do That: A Film for Families About Learning Differences.    He is the author of the 2009 memoir A Different Life: Growing Up Learning Disabled and Other Adventures, documenting his efforts to overcome VCFS,      and, with his father, he co-authored the 2012 book A Life's Work: Fathers and Sons.   He is the webmaster of Friends of Quinn, a website which he created in 2008 as part of the HealthCentral Network for learning disabled individuals.   It offers "resources and support for young adults with learning differences,"   and uses the dyslexic-friendly Dyslexie font to mitigate some of the issues that dyslexics experience when reading. As part of a series of website-video interviews with notable individuals, he interviewed filmmaker Steven Spielberg. In the interview, Spielberg described his own lifelong dyslexia and 2007 diagnosis of the developmental reading disorder.   Bradlee is also the youth engagement associate for the National Center for Learning Disabilities.  He married yoga instructor Pary Anbaz-Williamson in 2010.    The couple divorced in 2014.  Bradlee's paternal grandfather, Frederick Josiah Bradlee Jr., "could trace his American ancestry back through 10 generations" of the family.  This early collection of family history was further developed in his father's ancestry, and encouraged his own extensive interest in ancestry.  He is a patrilineal descendant of several of the Boston Brahmin families including the Bradlee, Choate, Crowninshield and Sargent families among others. He is also a descendant of the old colonial American and Puritan Putnam family founded by John and Priscilla Gould Putnam in 17th century Salem, Mass.      He is also a matrilineal descendant of several Mid-Atlantic and South Atlantic families including the McDougald, Quinn, Williams and Wilson families among others.
