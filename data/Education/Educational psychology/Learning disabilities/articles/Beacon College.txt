At the time, the Florida Department of Education approved the college's plan to introduce a focused undergraduate curriculum aligned specifically to the specialized learning and support needs of students who learn differently. Beacon awards both Associate of Arts (A.A.) and Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degrees.  In 2003, Beacon College earned full accreditation from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC).   It was reaffirmed for the full 10-year period in 2008, and again in 2017.
