His research on the development of creativity and his teaching have won national awards, including the American Psychological Association's Berlyne Prize  and the National Conference on College Teaching and Learningâ€™s Award for Innovative Excellence.

Kaufman)  His books include Domain Specificity of Creativity (Academic Press/Elsevier; 2016), Teaching for Creativity in the Common Core Classroom (with R. A. Beghetto & James C.
