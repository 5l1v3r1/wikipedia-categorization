Albert T. Corbett is an associate research professor emeritus of human–computer interaction at Carnegie Mellon University.  He is widely known for his role in the development of the Cognitive Tutor software,  leading to one article with over 1,000 citations.  Along with John Robert Anderson, he developed the Bayesian Knowledge Tracing algorithm, which is used in Cognitive Tutor software.  This work has been particularly influential in the educational data mining community—over half of the EDM conference papers published in 2011 and 2012 cited Bayesian Knowledge-Tracing.   Corbett studied psychology at Brown University, and obtained a doctorate in psychology from the University of Oregon.  His doctoral advisor was Wayne Wickelgren.
