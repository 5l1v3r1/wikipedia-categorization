Russell A. Barkley (born 27 December 1949) is a clinical psychologist who is a clinical professor of psychiatry at the Medical University of South Carolina     and an author of books on ADHD.      Involved in research since 1973 and a licensed psychologist since 1977, he is an expert on attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and has devoted much of his scientific career to studying ADHD and related problems like childhood defiance.   He proposed to change the name of sluggish cognitive tempo (SCT) to concentration deficit disorder (CDD).  Author of 15 books and more than 180 scientific papers, Barkley edits The ADHD Report, a newsletter for clinicians and parents. Besides his clinical work, he is also an expert in the neuropsychology of executive function and self-regulation. Barkley was born in Orange County, Newburgh, New York.  He was one of five children, born to Donald Stuart Barkley (27 February 1916 - 15 June 1999) and Mildred Minerva (10 September 1914 - 25 April 2008). Barkley had a twin brother, Ronald Foster Barkley,   who was killed in a car crash on 24 July 2006. Barkley attributes his brother's history of dangerous and reckless behavior, including not wearing a seat belt and speeding at the time of his crash, to untreated ADHD.  Ronald was several times over the drink drive limit, speeding and not wearing a speed belt at the time of his fatal crash.  Barkley married his wife Patricia on 15 March 1969. Barkley earned an Associate of Arts from Wayne Community College in Goldsboro, North Carolina in June 1972, and a BA in psychology from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  He earned an MA and Ph.D. in clinical psychology from Bowling Green State University in Bowling Green, Ohio.  From July 1976 to 1977, Barkley was an intern at the University of Oregon Health Sciences Center in Portland, Oregon.   In 1978, Barkley founded the Neuropsychology Service at the Medical College of Wisconsin and Milwaukee Children's Hospital, and served as its chief until 1985. He then moved to the University of Massachusetts Medical School, where he served as Director of Psychology from 1985 to 2000. Barkley was professor of psychiatry and neurology at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center.    In 2005, he joined the State University of New York Upstate Medical University in Syracuse, New York, where he was a research professor of psychiatry.   He has been at the Medical University of South Carolina since 2003.  One of Barkley's rating scales for adult ADHD evaluates sluggish cognitive tempo.  He has been a paid speaker and consultant for Eli Lilly, McNeil, Janssen-Orth, Janssen-Cilag, Novartis, Shire, and Theravance.       These financial ties have led to public criticism for a perceived conflict of interest.   Barkley, a leader in the burgeoning sluggish cognitive tempo research field has direct financial ties to Eli Lilly, a promoter of the condition (Barkley received $118,000 from 2009 to 2012 for consulting and speaking engagements from Eli Lilly). When referring to the "increasing clinical referrals occurring now and more rapidly in the near future driven by increased awareness of the general public in SCT", Barkley writes "The fact that SCT is not recognized as yet in any official taxonomy of psychiatric disorders will not alter this circumstance given the growing presence of information on SCT at various widely visited internet sites such as YouTube and Wikipedia, among others."  Peter Breggin and Fred Baughman are very critical of Barkley's work on ADHD, claiming that he exaggerates the benefits of stimulants and minimizes their hazards.  Barkley himself edits the Sluggish Cognitive Tempo Wikipedia page.  In the mid 1990s, Gretchen LeFever Watson, a practising psychologist in south east Virginia began a program of ADHD research that included epidemiologic surveys. This research documented 15% rates of ADHD diagnosis and drug treatment in her community. Diagnosis rates also slammed and attacked by Keith Conners and Allen Frances. Upon hearing of this, Barkley intervened and struck back, asserting that too few people were being diagnosed and medicated for ADHD. He visited the campus where Watson worked. Barkley's visit and actions resulted in Watson being dismissed from her position. Watson's community intervention programme, which was non-pharma based and had been effective, was dismantled.        On 16 November 1998 Barkley asserted that "Ritalin will be classed as one of the leading developments for helping individuals".  Barkley is a right-wing libertarian. He deeply believes in "Limited government, individual rights, freedom of speech and association, and the nonaggression principle (no one, including the government, has a right to initiate force or fraud against another), and private property rights". He has attacked "the leftist, social democratic or socialist leanings of Facebook's founder and most mainstream media outlets".
