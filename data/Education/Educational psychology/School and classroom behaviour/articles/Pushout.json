A student who leaves of their own accord (e.g., to work or care for a child), rather than through the action of the school, is considered a school <a href=\"/wiki/Dropping_out\" title=\"Dropping out\">dropout</a>.  In typical use, the category of pushouts excludes students who have been formally <a href=\"/wiki/Expulsion_(academia)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Expulsion (academia)\">expelled</a> from school for violating rules (e.g., for being violent).\n</p><p>Students may be pushed out of school because their presence in the school creates difficulty in meeting some goal of the school. For example, in the case where funding for the school is dependent upon scholastic achievement of the students, if the school can get rid of low-performing students, average test scores on academic performance tests will go up, thus increasing funding.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>  Schools may pushout <a href=\"/wiki/Truant\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Truant\">truant</a> students, who formally enroll in classes, but then refuse to attend.\n</p><p>In some low-performing schools in <a href=\"/wiki/Chicago,_Illinois\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Chicago, Illinois\">Chicago</a> combined dropout/pushout rates have exceeded 25% in one year.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Children are also pushed from schools because they present <a href=\"/wiki/School_discipline\" title=\"School discipline\">discipline</a> problems. Within youth advocacy and activist communities, pushout is a term that recognizes the intersecting forces of oppression most commonly responsible for high school \"drop outs\" within marginalized communities of color, allowing for the responsibility to be placed on those forces, rather than the youth impacted by unequal education, economics, disciplinary actions, and racism. \n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Pushout&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Dishonorable_discharge\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Dishonorable discharge\">Dishonorable discharge</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/School-to-prison_pipeline\" title=\"School-to-prison pipeline\">School-to-prison pipeline</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Pushout&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/31/nyregion/to-cut-failure-rate-schools-shed-students.html\">\"To Cut Failure Rate, Schools Shed Students\"</a> by Tamar Lewin and Jennifer Medina, <i>New York Times</i>.
