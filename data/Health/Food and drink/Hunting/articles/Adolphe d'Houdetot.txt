César François Adolphe d'Houdetot (31 August 1799 – 30 July 1869) was a 19th-century French writer, author of numerous books on hunting. The son of general César Louis d'Houdetot (fr), he joined the administration under Louis-Philippe and became a particular collector in the financial administration of Le Havre. In 1848, he prepared the boarding measures of the King and Queen for a sea cruise, which would be the subject of his book Honfleur et le Havre, huit jours d'une royale infortune (1850). His books were regularly published until today. The latest edition of his Chasseur rustique, illustrated by Horace Vernet, was published in 2000.  He also contributed to the writing of the comédie-vaudeville Le Coup de pistolet in 1828 with Charles de Livry, presented at Théâtre des Variétés 17 March 1828.
