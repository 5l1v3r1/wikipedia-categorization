A honey hole (or honeyhole) is slang for a location that yields a valued commodity or resource. A local landmark or road near a honey hole may have "Honey Hole" in its name  or as a nickname for a muddy spot.  In fishing, a honey hole could be a particular spot in a body of water (or used as a general term for the entire body of water)  where conditions are ideal for catching fish.  Such a spot could be the leading edge of a hump, a depression, or a bend in the channel.  In deer hunting, a honey hole is a place where the buck will be safe from the hunter and where the hunter rarely thinks of looking for a buck;  such a place could be an "acorn tree surrounded by a briar thicket or a tree on the edge of a patch of cane near a river or creek bank".
