  There are at least two hundred and twelve detailed drawings by Douglas Hamilton of South Indian landscapes, game animals and forestry operations.  Eighty seven of Hamilton's careful drawings of the Annaimalai Hills, Palani Hills and Shevaroy Hills are in the British Library,   ninety six drawings were published in his autobiography, Records of Sport in Southern India... and an additional thirty one were published in Forests and Gardens of South India.  Lieutenant-Colonel Douglas Hamilton (1818 – 1892) was a British Indian Army officer, gazetted to the 21st Regiment of the Madras Native Infantry from 1837 to 1871.  Hamilton was a well known forester, surveyor and illustrator of the early British hill stations in South India and a famous sportsman, shikari, big-game hunter and trophy collector.  He was an acute observer of nature and a gentleman.  Though executed only in pen and ink or pencil, these drawings have artistic merit due to the artists skillful use of hatching and stippling to achieve realistic texture, shading and perspective.  Hamilton's illustration of subjects and backgrounds that are unfamiliar to most people, creates initial interest in his drawings. His effective portrayal of actual or implied recent or future dramatic action heightens the viewers interest in his subjects. Hamilton selected his sketches that best illustrate scenes in his writing.  This implies there were also additional drawings, however their existence is now unknown. In 1862 Colonel Hamilton was relieved of routine regimental Army duties and given a roving commission by Sir Charles Trevelyan, the Finance Minister of India and former Governor of Madras Presidency, to conduct surveys and make drawings for the Government of all the hill plateaus in Southern India that might suit as Sanitaria, or quarters for European troops. Thereafter, Douglas Hamilton was on "special duty" with the 44th Regiment, Madras Native Infantry.   A series of five albums of careful drawings of the Annaimalai Hills, Palani Hills and Shevaroy Hills was the result of this commission. While at work on this commission he had great opportunities to follow his favorite pursuit of big game hunting, and also to observe the habits of the various animals inhabiting the different districts. These well-known drawings showed him as an accurate observer and a careful draughtsman. Each series of drawings was accompanied by a Survey article describing all aspects of the district.   Some of his publications about these surveys include: The India Office Records in the Asian and African Print Room at the British Library has five albums of Hamilton's work that include eighty six drawings.

It is about "years long gone by when the muzzle loader, with all its drawbacks, was the chief weapon in use."   All ninety five drawings in Records of Sport...  (with the exception of three) were taken from his sketch books. All scenes illustrated in these drawings are based on the actual hunting experiences of Colonel Hamilton described in full detail in his Autobiography. Those he drew in Indian ink were transferred as facsimiles by means of photo-etching. The others, sketched in pencil, were copied by Mr. J. T. Smit with such care and accuracy that the touch, as well as the spirit, of the original sketches was fully retained. The three plates of the two species of florican and of the jungle cat are from drawings made expressly for Records of Sport  by Mr. Smit. Several types of big game are the primary subject of most of these Drawings. Only a few of the drawings overlap with those in the India Office collection. He also drew several landscapes of Singapore, Java and Labuan during his visit there in 1848. The Drawings are: PREFACE CHAPTER I. - Shooting Antelope Stalking Antelope with Pony...1 Spearing Antelope...5 Wild Dog, Canis bengalensis...7 Oh, Great King, Don't be Angry...9 CHAPTER II. - Wolves, Wild Dogs, Boars, Mongoose, Small Game Shooting Wolves Watching Antelope...19 Wild Dogs, (Cuon rutilans)...25 Rather a Stopper...31 Bengal Florican...36 CHAPTER III. - Sporting Trip to the Dandilly Forest CHAPTER IV. - Singapore, Java and Labuan CHAPTER V. - Bears CHAPTER VI. - Ibex Shooting on the Nielgherries,  Annamullais, and Pulnies  The Old Saddleback...124 I Take Off My Shoes...127 A Close Shave...129 The Ibex Stalker..135 CHAPTER VII. - Elephants CHAPTER VIII. - Tigers, Leopards etc. Baffled...164 Mid-Day Siesta...192 I staring at him, and He Glaring and Growling...197 He stood to Listen, I Looking the Other Way...205 CHAPTER IX. - The Bison of Southern India I Plunged My Hunting Knife Into His Side...243 Head of bull bison...236 Dimensions of Bison horns...238 Axis deer, Trophy Antlers...279 CHAPTER X. - In 1861, 13 plates and 17 figures of drawings by Douglas Hamiton were published in The Forests and Gardens of South India written by his friend and co-conservator Hugh Francis Cleghorn.
