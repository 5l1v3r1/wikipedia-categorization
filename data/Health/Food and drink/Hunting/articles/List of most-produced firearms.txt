This page lists more than 100 small arms designs which have been produced in numbers exceeding one million since the late 18th century. Many more types have been made in the hundreds of thousands. Many of the firearms on this list are military weapons which were used during both World Wars, so it is unsurprising that they were manufactured in such high numbers. Others are civilian hunting and sporting weapons, which generally sell very well in countries such as the U.S. and Canada. Many of those produced have been destroyed, deactivated or fallen into disrepair, but others will have been kept in working order and sold or passed on from one generation to another down the years.  In 2018, Small Arms Survey reported that there are over one billion small arms distributed globally, of which 857 million (about 85 percent) are in civilian hands.   U.S. civilians alone account for 393 million (about 46 percent) of the worldwide total of civilian held firearms.  This amounts to "120.5 firearms for every 100 residents."  The World’s armed forces control about 133 million (about 13 percent) of the global total of small arms, of which over 43 percent belonging to two countries the Russian Federation (30.3 million) and China (27.5 million).  Law enforcement agencies control about 23 million (about 2 percent) of the global total of small arms.  origin of production of production (and derivatives) 3 million Yugoslav Zastava M70, 2 million East German Mpi Several million Egyptian Maadi (and similar) Self-loading rifle 3.5 million or more Type 99  and M1919 72,500 from 1919 to mid-30's, then 55,869 A1 models from 1936 to 1945  5 million M1919  1 million + Indian 1A1,  250,000 South African R1  (plus 30,000 sold to Rhodesia ), 230,000 Australian L1A1 and L2A1 ~200,000 Brazilian IMBEL M964,  ~150,000 Austrian StG 58,  ~65,000 Canadian C1 Automatic carbine ~500,000 civilian production by Colt  Up to 2 million Spanish Star Model A/B/M/P? 113,000 Argentine Ballester-Molina  1.6 million made in Birmingham and 2.7 million in London  Blackhawk/Vaquero ~2 million Blackhawk      ~650,000 Vaquero   bolt-action rifle Also produced as the Remington Model 11 and Savage Model 720 and 745 Woodsmaster ~150,000 – 1 million Taiwanese T57  FN Baby Browning Model 1955  619,000 Model 1955  750,000 Model 1863 Type II  and Detective Special 525,000 Model 1935  Young America Double Action Gamemaster Model 2 Double Action models 27, 28 and 29) 970,000 N-prefix serial numbers (Model 30 & 31, Model 32 & 33 and Model 34 & 35) Model 32 and 33: 122,678  Model 34 and 35: 219,801  Assault rifle and derivatives Machine pistol Tens of thousands of Spanish and Chinese copies.   .357/Trooper/Lawman/Python firearm origin  of production  of production or "Peacemaker" Still in production
