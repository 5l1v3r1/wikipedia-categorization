Migrating Eurasian birds exhausted from their long journey come to rest in the wetlands of the Nile delta. Ancient Egyptians capitalized from the large flocks of birds and hunted them either for food, offerings to the dead and gods. Bird hunting through <a href=\"/wiki/Fowling\" title=\"Fowling\">fowling</a> with sticks was considered to be a sport practiced by royalty in ancient Egypt. Fowling with sticks was practiced by throwing a stick at flying birds. Initially, fowling with sticks was considered as a hobby practiced by the elite,<sup id=\"cite_ref-Bailleul-LeSuer_4-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Bailleul-LeSuer-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> fowling with sticks became a common practice to commoners and not specific to royalty after the <a href=\"/wiki/Fifth_Dynasty_of_Egypt\" title=\"Fifth Dynasty of Egypt\">Fifth Dynasty</a>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Clap_net_bird_fowling\">Clap net bird fowling</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Hunting,_fishing_and_animals_in_ancient_Egypt&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Clap net bird fowling\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>A more efficient and effective technique practiced by ancient Egyptians to fowl birds was clap net, however it required teamwork, skilled fowlers, someone to coordinate and oversee, a clap net and sometimes a decoy bird which was usually a grey heron to attract the prey.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Bailleul-LeSuer_4-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Bailleul-LeSuer-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Fishing\">Fishing</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Hunting,_fishing_and_animals_in_ancient_Egypt&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Fishing\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Fish were very abundant in Egypt, as Egypt is located on both the <a href=\"/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea\" title=\"Mediterranean Sea\">Mediterranean</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Red_Sea\" title=\"Red Sea\">Red</a> Seas, along with the river <a href=\"/wiki/Nile\" title=\"Nile\">Nile</a>. Fishing was typically practiced on the river Nile, either by nets from a boat, using dragnets from shore or using bow nets in narrow banks of the river. On the other hand, fishing was also practiced as a sport for pleasure. Spear fishing and angle fishing were two types of fishing as a sport that required a lot of patience and skill.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Touny_5-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Touny-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Spear_fishing\">Spear fishing</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Hunting,_fishing_and_animals_in_ancient_Egypt&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Spear fishing\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>A demanding and challenging method of fishing, <a href=\"/wiki/Spearfishing\" title=\"Spearfishing\">spear fishing</a> requires certain attributes in the hunter, as patience to decoy the fish and a certain amount of accuracy to end up with a well-aimed throw. Spear fishing in ancient Egypt had greater value as a sport than angling did. Originally, in pre-historic and early times, spear fishing only served to provide food, and then it evolved into a recreation for the upper class.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Touny_5-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Touny-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Fishing_spears_and_their_construction\">Fishing spears and their construction</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Hunting,_fishing_and_animals_in_ancient_Egypt&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Fishing spears and their construction\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>According to archeological evidence, spears used in sports could be divided into three types; spears with a single head, two headed spears and harpoons. It is not clear whether harpoons were used to fish for fish only or for crocodiles and hippopotamus also; this is because of the relative small size of the harpoon to the size of the hippopotamus and crocodiles.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Angling\">Angling</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Hunting,_fishing_and_animals_in_ancient_Egypt&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Angling\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Similar to modern fishing, angle fishing was a very common fishing technique, which requires a hook, however, no fishing rods were used at the time, instead, thick hand lines. Angling was mostly practiced among commoners and not upper class Egyptians. Unlike spear fishing, angling was not practiced as a sport but it was an important means of obtaining food.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Touny_5-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Touny-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> The picture evidence available does not show upper-class people practicing angling. However, usually the pictures display commoners using angling to fish from a boat, with their masters watching. Evidence of the first fishing rod appears in the Middle Kingdom period, in the tomb of Beni Hasan. Later on in tombs of 18th and 19th dynasty officials, do we see evidence of upper class Egyptians practicing fishing by angling with their wives, which indicates that by that time, fishing by angling had become an upper class recreational sport.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Touny_5-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Touny-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Hunting\">Hunting</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Hunting,_fishing_and_animals_in_ancient_Egypt&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: Hunting\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>A common hobby in our time, hunting was practiced as a way to gather food or for self-defense against wild animals in ancient Egypt. Once people started domesticating animals and depended on the reproduction of animals for food, that hunting lost its importance as a source of nutrition. As a result of the loss of dependency on hunting as a food source, hunting then became a recreational sport. Hunting was practiced by royalty to signify power and ability to protect their people from danger.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Decker_3-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Decker-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Hippopotamus\">Hippopotamus</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Hunting,_fishing_and_animals_in_ancient_Egypt&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10\" title=\"Edit section: Hippopotamus\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The hippopotamus often signifies chaos and evil in ancient Egypt, as the hippopotamus was believed to be the incarnation of the god Seth, the opponent of the good gods Osiris and Horus. Horus then avenged his father Osiris by killing Seth, who is incarnated as a hippopotamus. The king then takes the role of Horus whenever he kills the hippopotamus.  From the <a href=\"/wiki/First_Dynasty_of_Egypt\" title=\"First Dynasty of Egypt\">First Dynasty</a> onwards, some pictures have been found with scenes in which the king hunts alone, as the hippopotamus became the symbol of chaos and evil. Hunting the hippopotamus displayed the king's unmatched power, as depicted in King Dewen's cylindrical seal, where he wrestles and pins down the hippopotamus weaponless.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Decker_3-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Decker-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> Other pictures have been found of tomb owners in the <a href=\"/wiki/New_Kingdom_of_Egypt\" title=\"New Kingdom of Egypt\">New Kingdom</a> killing the hippopotamus, these pictures are believed to have an exclusive religious significance.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Decker_3-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Decker-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Wild_bulls\">Wild bulls</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Hunting,_fishing_and_animals_in_ancient_Egypt&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11\" title=\"Edit section: Wild bulls\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Wild bulls were usually hunted by kings, this is evident in the story of king <a href=\"/wiki/Amenhotep_III\" title=\"Amenhotep III\">Amenophis III</a>; where a man informed the king that there are wild bulls in the desert in the area of Fayum.  The king then traveled north to Fayum accompanied by his army and ordered the soldiers to observe the wild bulls and confine them with fences and ditches. King Amenophis III spent four days in the hunt without resting his horses and had a tally of ninety-six wild bulls out of a total of one hundred and seventy bulls observed. Moreover, drawings of bull hunting have been represented on the walls of <a href=\"/wiki/Ramesses_II\" title=\"Ramesses II\">Ramesses II</a>'s funerary temple in Madinet Habu, where he stabs the last breath out of an injured bull.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Decker_3-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Decker-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Lions\">Lions</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Hunting,_fishing_and_animals_in_ancient_Egypt&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12\" title=\"Edit section: Lions\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Often identified as the king of the jungle and a symbol of power in the animal kingdom.

Moreover, <a href=\"/wiki/Thutmose_III\" title=\"Thutmose III\">Tuthmosis III</a> bragged about his ability to hunt lions, claiming that he killed seven lions in one second using his arrow shot.

It is not until the Egyptians push into Asia in the 18th dynasty that the Egyptian came into contact with elephants. Hunting elephants was treasured by Egyptian kings because of their ivory, which was a remains a valuable, moreover, hunting elephants displayed the power of the king because of their immense size.
