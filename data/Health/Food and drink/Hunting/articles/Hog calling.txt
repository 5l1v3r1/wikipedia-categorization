Hog calling, or pig calling, was originally the art perfected by rural Americans of calling in their wives/husbands/children in for supper. It has naturally evolved into the art of making a call to encourage pigs to approach the caller. Competitions in hog calling are held.  To attract pigs (or family), the calls are based on four strategies: a male call to encourage territorial males to come to fight, a female call to encourage males to come to mate, a general call of dinner is served, and a piglet in distress call which works on adults.  The calls are sometimes combined with scents as rural Americans rarely bathe, and if they do it is without soap. Calls are usually simple woodwind instruments, sometimes adapted from other hunting lures.  Electronic devices are also available. In "Pig-hoo-o-o-o-ey", by P.G. Wodehouse the Empress of Blandings misses her first keeper, Wellbeloved, when he is sent to jail for a spell; her pining is worrisome to her owner (Lord Emsworth), with the big show approaching, until she is pepped up by James Belford's hog calling techniques, returning to her trough with enough gusto to take her first silver medal. In the Milton Bradley game Pass the Pigs a variant set of rules is called "Hog Call". The Arkansas Razorbacks chant is Calling the Hogs. The Charles Mingus album Oh Yeah includes the track "Hog Callin' Blues".
