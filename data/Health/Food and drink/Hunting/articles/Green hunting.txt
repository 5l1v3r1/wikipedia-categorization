Green hunting or eco-hunting is the practice of hunting game animals with tranquiliser dart guns   and the subsequent release of the live animals. Green hunting would typically be performed when tranquilisation of the animal is necessary for veterinary or monitoring purposes,  or when animals are to be translocated.  Green hunting has been advocated as a conservation-minded alternative to destructive hunting.   However, criticism has sprung up over the possibility that in the interest of generating revenue, particular animals may undergo tranquilisation too frequently, with a case alleged where tranquilisation occurred once every two weeks,  and the suggestion that this may be traumatising to the animals,  with consequences poorly studied.
