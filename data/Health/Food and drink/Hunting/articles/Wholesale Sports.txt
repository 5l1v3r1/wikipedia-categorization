Wholesale Sports Outdoor Outfitters was a Canadian owned and operated retailer in western Canada of hunting, fishing and camping gear and apparel, that provided advice and merchandise for outdoor sports and activities. Wholesale Sports offered equipment, clothing and accessories in the camping, hunting, and fishing categories to outdoor enthusiasts across western Canada. Founded by two brothers from Calgary, they acquired local retailers including Frenchy's and Barottos Sports, establishing Wholesale Sports as a retailer and distributor to western Canada's sportsmen and women. Over time, Wholesale Sports acquired and opened additional stores in  Edmonton, Lethbridge, Winnipeg, Saskatoon and Kamloops. UFA acquired Wholesale Sports Canada in early 2008.  A year later, they acquired the leases of 15 Sportsman's Warehouse stores with an employee base of 1,200. Sportsman's Warehouse, a privately held Salt Lake City-based outdoor adventure retailer, had 68 locations throughout the U.S. before UFA acquired 15 sites.  The Fargo, North Dakota location was closed in July 2011, leaving 14 stores in the U.S., and 11 in Canada. In 2013 UFA divested its U.S. Wholesale Sports business.  Wholesale Sports opened its 12th and 13th Canadian locations in Prince George, B.C. (2013),  and Westbank, B.C. (2014).
