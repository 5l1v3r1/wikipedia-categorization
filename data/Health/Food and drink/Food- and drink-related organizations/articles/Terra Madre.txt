Terra Madre is a network of food communities. Terra Madre network was launched by the Slow Food grass roots organization, and the intent is to provide small-scale farmers, breeders, fishers and food artisans whose approach to food production protects the environment and communities. The network brings them together with academics, cooks, consumers and youth groups so that they can join forces in working to improve the food system.  The Terra Madre network holds a major biennial conference which are held in Torino, Italy  intended to foster discussion and introduce innovative concepts in the field of food, gastronomy, globalization, economics. The first of these conferences was held in 2004. The national and regional Terra Madre work closely with the Slow Food convivia to increase the capacity of local communities to provide good, clean and fair food.
