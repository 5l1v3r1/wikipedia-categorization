The International Pepper Community (IPC) is an intergovernmental organisation of states that produce agricultural pepper. In Bangkok on 16 April 1971, the Agreement establishing the International Pepper Community was concluded. After this treaty came into force on 29 March 1972, the IPC was created. IPC headquarters are located in Jakarta, Indonesia. Six states have ratified the IPC Agreement and are thus full members of the IPC: Brazil (since 1981), India (1972), Indonesia (1972), Malaysia (1972), Sri Lanka (2002), and Vietnam (2005). Papua New Guinea has not ratified the Agreement but has been admitted to the IPC as an associate member.
