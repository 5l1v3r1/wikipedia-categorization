Costa Vida began in 2003 when J.D. and Sarah Gardner were on vacation in Cabo San Lucas. According to fastfoodmenuprices.com, "The couple fell in love with the beautiful beaches and the fresh food made with so much passion and love. As a result, they opened their flagship restaurant in Layton, Utah."  Costa Vida has a primarily Mexican/Tex-Mex-inspired menu, Including burritos, salads, enchiladas, tacos, quesadillas, nachos, soups, and chips and salsa.
