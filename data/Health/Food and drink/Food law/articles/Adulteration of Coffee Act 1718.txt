The Adulteration of Coffee Act 1718 (5 Geo. 1 c. 11) was an Act of Parliament of the Parliament of Great Britain concerning the adulteration of coffee, which made it illegal to debase coffee. It was passed in 1718. When coffee later fell out of fashion to be replaced by tea, a similar law was then introduced, the Adulteration of Tea Act of 1776. The Act provided a penalty of 20 pounds "against divers evil-disposed persons who at the time or soon after roasting of coffee, make use of water, grease, butter, or such like material whereby the same is made unwholesome and greatly increased in weight, to the prejudice of His Majesty's Revenue, the health of his subjects, and to the loss of all fair and honest dealers." The Act was repealed by the Statute Law Revision Act 1958.  Coffee portal Bailey, Liberty Hyde (1909). Cyclopedia of American Agriculture. Macmillan Publishers. Retrieved March 28, 2009.Â
