Although Indians produced some pemmican and traded it directly to European posts, more commonly, British commerce came to depend on pemmican mass-produced by Europeans at their own posts.\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-colpitts179_5-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-colpitts179-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Pemmican became the main source of food throughout the Bison trade nearing the end of the eighteenth century. The Hudson\u2019s Bay Company relied on the food to provide a source of energy for their fur-traders who had relocated to areas that had a scarce food supply but plenty of fur.<sup id=\"cite_ref-colpitts179_5-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-colpitts179-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> By the mid-1790s the first systems of small wintering posts had become massive food depots, with Montreal companies organizing depots in the Red River Valley.<sup id=\"cite_ref-colpitts179_5-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-colpitts179-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> The Hudson\u2019s Bay Company grew concerned during the turn of the century because their rival, the North West Company, was providing trappers in the north with enough Pemmican to allow them to specialize their hunting patterns to cater to the English trading posts rather than the HBC.<sup id=\"cite_ref-morton157_6-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-morton157-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>\u201c The impact of the European factory system on traditional pemmican production has yet to be fully studied, especially at carryover places and between watersheds where large communities of indigenous people gathered. Indeed, it became so commonplace for woodland hunters to visit and even inhabit trade routes and major transshipment points where they might gain access to the plains-trade pemmican stockpiled there that the HBC eventually outlawed its crews from making such exchanges and sternly rebuked traders who made it available around their posts.\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-colpitts179_5-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-colpitts179-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The early nineteenth century saw competition increase between food trading companies in and around the Red River settlement. This led to a steep increase in Pemmican prices, which would become a problem in 1811 when winter conditions became extremely harsh. By 1813, companies instructed their traders to offer Native hunters \u201cextraordinary payment\u201d for hunting beyond their specific provisions.<sup id=\"cite_ref-colpitts179_5-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-colpitts179-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>\u201cCompetition over the trade, poor winters, and hunters burning the plains escalated prices and, in the end, contributed to one of Rupert\u2019s Land\u2019s more chaotic turns in 1814 with the advent of the \u201cPemmican Wars\u201d\u2014where the Selkirk settlers, under the Pemmican Proclamation, attempted to regulate and control pemmican production by rival companies.21 This very issue sparked the bloody Battle of Seven Oaks in 1816: M\u00e9tis clashed with settlers who had earlier seized and now competed for the high-priced food supplies of the NWC coming from the Assiniboine River.\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-colpitts179_5-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-colpitts179-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>A major contributor to the controversy surrounding the Red River Settlement was the purchasing of Hudson\u2019s Bay Company shares by Thomas Douglas, the 5th Lord of Selkirk. Douglas, in an attempt to provide new opportunities for Scottish settlers, purchased enough shares from the HBC to be granted a large land settlement in the Red River. Conflict arose from the situation because not only was Douglas granted a massive chunk of the Red River Settlement but he did not want trade to profit the rival North West Company, which led to the Lord of Selkirk cutting off the Metis inhabiting &#160;the Red River colony and interfering with NWC trade routes. The harsh living conditions and scarcity of food would eventually lead to Douglas\u2019 reliance on the Metis and the introduction of the Pemmican Proclamation, considering the ties he had severed with those he now depended on in the area.<sup id=\"cite_ref-carter60_7-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-carter60-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The Proclamation was submitted as evidence during the <b>Pemmican War Trials</b> held in Montreal in 1818.<a href=\"/wiki/Pemmican_Proclamation#cite_note-pemmican_war_trials-6\" title=\"Pemmican Proclamation\"><sup>[6]</sup></a> and published in the: Report of trials in the courts of Canada, relative to the destruction of the Earl of Selkirk's settlement on the Red River With observations (p.&#160;61-62) by <a href=\"/wiki/Andrew_Amos_(lawyer)\" title=\"Andrew Amos (lawyer)\">Amos Andrew</a> in 1820.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Pemmican_Trade\">Pemmican Trade</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Pemmican_Proclamation&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Pemmican Trade\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>For the settlers living near the Red River on the edge of the prairie, the Pemmican Trade was an important source of trade for the Red River Valley, almost comparable to what the beaver-pelt trade did for the Natives farther north. This trade was a major factor in the emergence of a distinct M\u00e9tis society. &#160;<a href=\"/wiki/M%C3%A9tis_buffalo_hunt#Pemmican_trade\" title=\"M\u00e9tis buffalo hunt\">Pemmican</a> was made of dried buffalo meat pounded into a powder and mixed with melted buffalo fat in leather bags. Packs of pemmican would be shipped north and stored at the major fur posts. Ultimately, as the Pemmican trade began to establish its position within the Red River and other parts of the prairies, the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company (HBC) and North West Company (NWC).<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>To procure pemmican in sufficient quantities, the HBC and NWC traded for it at several outposts in the Red River District and shipped it to their <a href=\"/wiki/Bas_de_la_Rivi%C3%A8re\" title=\"Bas de la Rivi\u00e8re\">Bas de la Rivi\u00e8re</a> depot on Lake Winnipeg where it was distributed to brigades of north canoes passing between <a href=\"/wiki/Fort_William,_Ontario\" title=\"Fort William, Ontario\">Fort William</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Athabasca_Country\" title=\"Athabasca Country\">Athabasca</a> or transported to Fort William where it was issued to brigades going to the company\u2019s eastern and southern districts. The majority of the NWC\u2019s pemmican was purchased from the local M\u00e9tis and to a lesser degree from the local First Nations people and freemen.The pemmican, which forms the staple article of produce from the summer hunt, is a species of food peculiar to <a href=\"/wiki/Rupert%27s_Land\" title=\"Rupert&#39;s Land\">Rupert's Land</a>. It is composed of buffalo meat, dried and pounded fine, and mixed with an amount of <a href=\"/wiki/Tallow\" title=\"Tallow\">tallow</a> or buffalo fat equal to itself in bulk.The tallow having been boiled, is poured hot from the caldron into an oblongbag, manufactured from the buffalo hide, into which the pounded meat has previously been placed. The contents are then stirred together until they havebeen thoroughly well mixed. When full, the bag is sewed up and laid in store.Each bag when full weighs one hundred pounds. It is calculated that, on anaverage, the carcass of each buffalo will yield enough pemmican to fill one bag<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Ultimately, the pemmican trade was a major factor for the expanding provisions that were being streamlined and developed within the Red River Area, as well as Winnipeg and other parts of the Prairies located between Manitoba and Saskatchewan. The two Major trading companies which were the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company and North-West Company began establishing various territories and boundaries where they could exercise the Pemmican trade. Both the HBC and the NWC needed to establish their trade routes in the area to secure the economic benefits of Pemmican. Therefore, the need to establish a trade route led to conflict between the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company and the North West Company that erupted in 1812.\n</p><p>\"In 1812, the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company established the Selkirk agricultural colony on the banks of the Red River. This posed a strategic threat to the North West Company since the colony lay astride its provision supply line in that quarter. The seriousness of the danger was manifest in the winter of 1814. The colony was seriously short of provisions.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The need for the North West Company and Hudson\u2019s Bay Company to establish a suitable route of transportation for the Pemmican trade would be vital in securing economic prosperity. The Red River was beginning to see an increase in settlements and trading posts erecting in the area, as the Red River served as a vital mode of transportation. The NWC had previously built a strong relationship with the Metis, and ultimately the NWC positioned themselves as defenders of the Natives and M\u00e9tis, and thus became opponents of the HBC colonization scheme that would illegally dispossess the native peoples. Furthermore, it was vital for these companies to secure an alliance when trading Pemmican because the native expertise in buffalo hunting would serve as the most productive way obtaining Pemmican ingredients.<sup id=\"cite_ref-:0_1-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:0-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> Also, since there had been a food shortage in these areas since 1776, Pemmican became a prominent source of food in the Red River settlements. Pemmican would be an important food source during the winter months and would serve as an offset or back-up to inconsistent crop-growth within settlements. With the food shortage however came an increase in the price and trade of Pemmican.\n</p><p>\"In such circumstances, Indian suppliers drove up prices on provisions offered to Europeans. While volumes increased to meet European demands by the turn of the century, so did the traded value, or price, of these commodities, especially in areas hard hit by changing game conditions. In 1801 intense local competition between traders raised prices overall. Lower Red River outfits, by then supplying massive amounts of food to the trading companies, priced depot pemmican at an astronomical shilling per pound\u2014in better circumstances, Europeans could get it for a quarter or less than that\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-colpitts179_5-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-colpitts179-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The increased price of Pemmican, combined with the food shortage and tensions between the settlement of HBC and NWC territories ultimately developed into conflict. Tensions erupted in the end, which contributed to one of Rupert\u2019s Land more chaotic turns in 1814 with \u201cThe Pemmican Proclamation,\u201d which attempted to regulate and control pemmican production by rival companies. This very issue sparked the bloody Battle of Seven Oaks in 1816, which saw the M\u00e9tis clash with settlers who had earlier seized and now competed for the high-priced food supplies of the NWC coming from the Assiniboine River.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Impact_of_the_Pemmican_Proclamation_.28The_Pemmican_War.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Impact_of_the_Pemmican_Proclamation_(The_Pemmican_War)\">Impact of the Pemmican Proclamation (The Pemmican War)</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Pemmican_Proclamation&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Impact of the Pemmican Proclamation (The Pemmican War)\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The Pemmican Proclamation was a key factor in the onslaught of the <a href=\"/wiki/Pemmican_War\" title=\"Pemmican War\">Pemmican War</a> that took place from 1812-1821.

Commissioner Coltman stated the first shot was fired by the HBC/ Selkirk Settlers, and the Metis most likely reacted in self defense.</sub> <sub>The aftermath of the confrontation between the two groups left The HBC/ Selkirk Settlers with 21 deaths and one survivor, whereas the Metis only had one man killed. <a href=\"/wiki/Robert_Semple_(Canada)\" title=\"Robert Semple (Canada)\">Robert Semple</a>, Governor of Assiniboia was killed in the gunfire.</sub><sup id=\"cite_ref-:3_12-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:3-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> <sub>Which group fired the first shot is still a debated subject among scholars, however Lyle Dick notes it has been dubbed \u201cThe Seven Oaks Massacre\u201d by scholar of the time period George Bryce in 1870.</sub><sup id=\"cite_ref-:3_12-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:3-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> <sub>The notion the <a href=\"/wiki/Battle_of_Seven_Oaks\" title=\"Battle of Seven Oaks\">Battle of Seven Oaks</a> was a massacre was a new \u201cmaster narrative\u201d of Western progress in 1870, which depicts Metis as savage villains, and white European settlers as the unanimous hero or victim.</sub> <sub>The Pemmican Proclamationwas a main reason the <a href=\"/wiki/Battle_of_Seven_Oaks\" title=\"Battle of Seven Oaks\">Battle of Seven Oaks</a> to take place and is one of many confrontations between the Metis and white settler Europeans. The Pemmican Proclamation also led to European\u2019s control of the pemmican market in the 1820\u2019s. The price of pemmican during the <a href=\"/wiki/Pemmican_War\" title=\"Pemmican War\">Pemmican War</a> was kept low until small amounts of buffalo or meat could be found, when pemmican prices would grow causing many issues for Metis. George Coltpitts, author of the article \u201c Market Economies in the British Buffalo Commons in the Early Nineteenth Century\u201d, notes these changes stating \u201cIn the earlier provisions trade, local Indian hunters clearly controlled the hunt and the price of provisions on the market. Indians demanded ever-higher prices from British traders for their products, including dried meats, fats, and pemmican. But with the amalgamation of British fur trade companies in 1821, almost all plains hunters inhabiting the large territories of the Blackfoot Nations (Kainai, Siksika, and Piikani), the Atsina (Gros Ventre), the Assiniboine-Nakota, and the Plains Cree lost bargaining power to a consolidated and systematic provisions buyer. By the 1830s, pemmican cost the equivalent of 2 pence per pound (d/lb), a price at least four times lower than it had been three decades earlier. Prices remained remarkably low across vast stretches of the British North American territories and stayed that way until the depleted herds could no longer feed the thousands of indigenous people and newcomers dependent upon them. Occasionally, regional game depletion or bad hunting weather limited the supply of raw materials needed to make pemmican; short supply tipped the market advantage to the Indians, who raised prices to meet increasing demand for their products. But by the late 1820s, HBC managers developed a standing order system and a region-wide buying strategy that stabilized the market and significantly undermined Indian bargaining power. The HBC in turn enjoyed an enviable advantage as a consumer of pemmican; it progressively enlarged its purchases and use of this cheapened energy source\u201d.</sub><sup id=\"cite_ref-colpitts179_5-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-colpitts179-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> <sub>The Pemmican Proclamation caused many issues for the Metis and aboriginal population of Canada for many years after its legislation was passed.\n</sub></big></p><p><big><br />\n</big></p><p><big>During the late 1790s and heading into the turn of the century, pemmican became a leading source of food throughout the fur trading monopolies. This transition to pemmican began because it was a source of energy that could be stored and preserved for long periods of time, which allowed fur traders to venture beyond designated areas to find game because of this new unspoiled food.<sup id=\"cite_ref-colpitts179_5-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-colpitts179-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> From first establishing small food systems to organizing massive food depots, companies began to realize that they could heavily profit from an entirely European run production of pemmican.<sup id=\"cite_ref-morton157_6-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-morton157-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> A major step towards this transition to a European system was the involvement of Thomas Douglas, 5th Lord of Selkirk. Douglas had a strong desire to relocate poor Scottish immigrants to profitable land settlements. The Red River and the pemmican industry would have been perfect for the Lord of Selkirk and his colonizers because Douglas had used his fortune to purchase enough HBC shares to be granted land in the Red River Settlement. This meant the Lord of Selkirk\u2019s men (he promised 200 annually to the HBC) could take over the pemmican production, stop the Metis from supplying the NWC, and interrupt fur trades routes of rival company trappers.<sup id=\"cite_ref-carter60_7-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-carter60-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> He did not plan for the extreme weather conditions and scarcity of food because of said conditions that would come in the years of 1811-1813. This would lead to the settlers\u2019 dependence on the Metis for survival and the Pemmican Proclamation that would ban the export of pemmican from the Red River Settlement to avoid starvation. This would be the beginnings of the Pemmican War that would ensue shortly after.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources.
