Square One Organic Vodka is a spirit distilled from organically grown rye.    Square One Organic Vodka is made from organic American-grown rye, and with water drawn from the Snake River which runs underneath the distillery.  The facility gets 25% of its electricity from a local wind farm through renewable energy credits.  Allison Evanow formed Square One Organic Spirits, LLC, in Novato, California to launch Square One Organic Vodka in April, 2006.   Remarking on the nature of organic and environmentally conscious alcohol brands, including Square One, one reviewer/bar owner wrote "Alcohol is still alcohol, youâ€™re not getting a better buzz or less of a hangover. The point is [...] doing things differently."
