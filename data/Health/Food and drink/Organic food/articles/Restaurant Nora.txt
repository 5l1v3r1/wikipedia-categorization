Restaurant Nora is America's first certified organic restaurant, located in Washington, D.C..  To gain the certification, Chef Nora Pouillon proved that at least 95 percent of the ingredients used—including meats, vegetables, dairy, flour, coffee, chocolate, and oils—were from certified organic farmers and suppliers.  As a result, the restaurant's menu changes seasonally.  In January 2010, President Barack Obama held a surprise birthday party for First Lady Michelle Obama at the restaurant.   Restaurant Nora has held lunches, dinners and events for dignitaries, congressional members and White House administrations, and was a favorite of Hillary Clinton.
