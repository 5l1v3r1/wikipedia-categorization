Histamine intolerance, sometimes called histaminosis, is an over-accumulation of histamine in the human body.  Histamine intolerance is sometimes informally called an allergy;  however, the intolerance is technically caused by the gradual accumulation of extracellular histamine due to an imbalance. Roughly 1% of the population has histamine intolerance;  of those, 80% are middle-aged.  The imbalance in histamine intolerance is between the synthesis and selective release of histamine from certain granulocytes (i.e., mast cells and basophils), versus the breakdown of histamine by the enzymes which metabolize it, such as diamine oxidase (DAO) and histamine N-methyltransferase (HNMT).   In contrast, allergic reactions involving an immediate allergic response to an allergen are caused by anaphylactic degranulation, which is the abrupt and explosive release of "pre-formed mediators", including histamine, from mast cells and basophils throughout the body.
