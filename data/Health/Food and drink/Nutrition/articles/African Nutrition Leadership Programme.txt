The long-term aim of the ANLP is to meet the demands for leadership in Africa to solve its nutritional challenges. The programme is designed for individuals who have experience in various fields of nutrition. Preference will be given to candidates with a postgraduate qualification, postdoctoral fellows and candidates with comparable working experience in the broader human nutrition sciences, studying or working in Africa. The ANLP is a leadership development and networking seminar aimed at assisting the development of future leaders in the field of human nutrition in Africa.  Emphasis is placed on understanding the qualities and skills of leaders, team building, communication and nutrition information in a broader context, and to understanding the role of nutrition science in the world around us.
