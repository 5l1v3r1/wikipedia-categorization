The Federation of European Nutrition Societies (FENS) is a non-profit association, established in 1979   as a roof organization for the national nutrition societies in Europe, with each country represented by its representative Nutrition Society or Association within FENS. The aims of FENS are the combination of efforts for the development of research and education in Nutrition Sciences and the promotion of the importance of Nutrition for public health in Europe. It seeks to do this by coordinating the European nutrition societies at a European level, promoting and disseminating research and knowledge on nutrition sciences and facilitating nutrition learning and training, as well as scientific exchange across Europe. FENS conducts every 4 years its main event, the FENS European Nutrition Conference, which is organized by one of the FENS member societies, elected by the FENS General Assembly. All FENS Member Societies and Associations can take part in the bidding process for the organization of a FENS ENC.  The Federation of European Nutrition Societies is a member of the International Union of Nutritional Sciences (IUNS)   and the official FENS Journal is the “Annals of Nutrition and Metabolism”  (IF 2014/2015: 2.618)
