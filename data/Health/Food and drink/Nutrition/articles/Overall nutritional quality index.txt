The overall nutritional quality index is a nutritional rating system developed at the Yale-Griffin Prevention Research Center. It assigns foods a score between 1 and 100 to reflect the overall nutrition provided relative to the calories consumed.  The system has been marketed commercially as NuVal, and some consumer foods in the United States are marked with ONQI values as "NuVal". The ONQI for a food is the ratio of a "numerator" value representing beneficial nutrients such as iron, dietary fibre and vitamins,  and a "denominator" value representing detrimental nutrients such as cholesterol and saturated fat. The following foods have the maximum ONQI of 100:  broccoli, blueberries, okra, oranges and green beans. Some of the lowest ONQIs are for white bread (9), hot dog (5), apple pie (2) and Ice pop (1).
