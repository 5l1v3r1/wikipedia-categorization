Organic feeding disorders are created when there are changes in an organism which directly or indirectly affect the organism's need to survive, or the need for nourishment.  For example, when someone becomes ill, their body is naturally not as hungry as it was before.  This can also occur if a person's food intake is reduced; over time they will not want to eat as much and will reduce their efforts towards seeking out nourishment.
