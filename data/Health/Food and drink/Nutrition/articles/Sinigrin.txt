Sinigrin is a glucosinolate that belongs to the family of glucosides found in some plants of the Brassicaceae family such as Brussels sprouts, broccoli, and the seeds of black mustard (Brassica nigra). Whenever sinigrin-containing plant tissue is crushed or otherwise damaged, the enzyme myrosinase degrades sinigrin to a mustard oil (allyl isothiocyanate), which is responsible for the pungent taste of mustard and horseradish.  Seeds of white mustard, Sinapis alba, will give a much less pungent mustard because this species contains a different glucosinolate, sinalbin. The chemical name of sinigrin is allylglucosinolate or 2-propenylglucosinolate. Sinigrin stereochemical configuration on the C=N double bond was for a time uncertain, and has been resolved by X-ray crystallography in 1963 to be the Z (or syn) isomer.  Singrin is also known to be allelopathic.
