Waste No Food is a [non-profit organization] that provides a web-based food rescue "marketplace" allowing excess food to be donated from the food service industry to qualified charities that work with the needy. It facilitates the donation of food waste from farms, restaurants and grocery stores to charities that can use it. Recipient charities are vetted by InnVision.  The nonprofit was founded by Kiran Sridhar, then a 12-year-old 7th grader at a Bay Area school, as a way to improve the distribution of food and reduce waste. Sridhar, now a sophomore at Stanford University, still heads the organization.  Waste No Food was initially focused in the Silicon Valley area and has been expanded to San Francisco.
