FareShare is a charity aimed at relieving food poverty and reducing food waste  in the UK. It does this by rescuing good quality surplus food that would otherwise have gone to waste and sending it to almost 10,000 charity and community groups across the United Kingdom.  FareShare only redistributes food inside its best before and use by date; in 2016/7 they rescued over 17,000 tonnes of food which would have otherwise gone to waste or landfill.  FareShare works with all sectors of the supply chain; producers, manufacturers and retailers. All of the major UK food retailers have encouraged their suppliers to work with FareShare to minimise food waste. FareShare has also run two successful food drives with both Sainsbury's and Tesco.  In February 2018, the charity announced a three year £20 million partnership with ASDA and The Trussell Trust with the aim of helping more than one million people out of food poverty over the next three years.  FareShare contributed towards more than 36.7 million meals in 2016/17, which equates to feeding over 772,000 people a week. The food FareShare supplies enables the charity sector to make £28.7 million in savings per year . This food is delivered to a broad range of frontline charities and community groups across the UK including homeless shelters, day centres, women’s refuge centres and children's breakfast clubs. In 2010 the charity won "Britain's Most Admired Charity" at the Third Sector awards.  In 2017 the charity won "Charity of the Year" at both the Charity Times awards  and Third Sector Awards , and were selected for the Telegraph's Christmas Charity Appeal .
