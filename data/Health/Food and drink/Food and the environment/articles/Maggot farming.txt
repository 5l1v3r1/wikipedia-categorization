Maggot farming is the act of growing maggots for the industry. It is distinct from vermicomposting as there is no separate composting process going on, and maggots are used which are distinct from earthworms (they also consume only flesh, not plant-based material). A variety of species can be used, including the black soldier fly,   as well as various other fly species. Due to convenience, fly species are often used which are indigenous to the area of cultivation. When using indigenous fly species, one tactic (employed by the Songhai Center in Benin)  is to simply dump offal or meat that has exceeded the sell-by date in concrete bins. The bins are then covered with chicken wire to prevent any large animals of being able to feed off it. Then, flies deposit eggs on the offal and meat, and maggots hatch and consume it. After that, the bins are filled with water, so the maggots start to float (separating themselves from any leftovers). The maggots are then harvested and the leftover is discarded or further processed (e.g., bones can be ground to bone meal, ...). The maggots are often sold and used as animal feed. Especially fish, chickens, pig, ducks appreciate them.   It can also be sold as fishing bait.
