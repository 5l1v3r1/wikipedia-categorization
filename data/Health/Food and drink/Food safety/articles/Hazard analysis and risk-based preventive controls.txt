Hazard analysis and risk-based preventive controls or HARPC is a successor to the Hazard analysis and critical control points (HACCP) food safety system. It is mandated by the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) of 2010. As the name implies, Preventive Controls systems emphasize prevention of hazards before they occur rather than their detection after they occur.  The FDA is releasing the rules in the Federal Registry beginning in September 2015.  The first release of rules addressed Preventive Controls for Human Food and Preventive Controls for Foods for Animals.  The Produce Safety Final Rule, the Foreign Supplier Verification Programs (FSVP) Final Rule and the Accredited Third-Party Certification Final Rule were issued on November 13, 2015.  The Sanitary Transportation of Human and Animal Food final rule was issued on April 6, 2016,  and the Mitigation Strategies To Protect Food Against Intentional Adulteration (Food Defense) final rule was issued on May 27, 2016.  All food companies in the United States that are required to register with the FDA under the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002, as well as firms outside the US that export food to the US, must have a written FSMA-compliant Food Safety Plan in place by the deadlines listed below: Additionally, for the first time food safety is being extended to pet food and animal feed, with firms being given an extra year to implement Current Good Manufacturing Practices before a Preventive Controls system the following year: The FDA estimates that 73,000 businesses currently fall under these definitions.
