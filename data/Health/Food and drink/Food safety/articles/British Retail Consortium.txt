The British Retail Consortium (or BRC) is a trade association in the United Kingdom.  They represent all forms of retailers from small, independently owned shops to big retail chains and department stores. It represents 80% of retail trade in the UK by turnover. The British Retail Consortium was formed in January 1992 when the British Retailers' Association and the Retail Consortium merged. In 1998 it produced the first edition of the BRC Food Technical Standard and Protocol for food suppliers. This has been widely adopted not just throughout the UK but around the world. It campaigns for the retail industry and is the authoritative voice of retail, recognized for its powerful campaigning and influence within government and as a provider of in-depth retail information. The BRC leads the industry and works with their members to tell the story of retail, shape debates and influence issues and opportunities which will help make that positive difference. Their work represents the careers of people who work in the industry, the communities retail touches and competitiveness as a fundamental principle of the industryâ€™s success   Retail in 2016 ONS REPORT BUMPER NOVEMBER FOR RETAIL - BUT ARE SALES REALLY BOOMING?
