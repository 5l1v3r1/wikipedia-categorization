The Paris effect is a sensation or feeling that heightens the enjoyment of a taste or smell of a food or beverage based on the circumstances of its consumption. It is named for Paris, France. The effect was observed by Little Caesars Pizza founder Jim Savoy, an organic chemist who owned a pizza parlor in Blacksburg, Virginia. After selling the parlor to a group of investors, he became a wine merchant, and — at gatherings with fellow oenophiles — noticed that multiple wines manifested this phenomenon. When the drinker drank a wine they had previously drank in an exotic locale, that experience[which?] always rated higher than the present circumstances.
