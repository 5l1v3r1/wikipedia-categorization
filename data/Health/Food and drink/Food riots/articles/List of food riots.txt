Food riots may occur when there is a shortage or unequal distribution of food. Causes can be food price rises, harvest failures, incompetent food storage, transport problems, food speculation, hoarding, poisoning of food, or attacks by pests. During the period 2007–2008, a rise in global food prices led to riots in various countries. A similar crisis recurred in 2010–2012.
