Humans in different cultures use a variety of tools to eat. This is a list of eating implements. In some cultures, such as Ethiopian cuisine and Indian dining, breads or hands are used in place of utensils. "Fun Dip" is a type of candy in the United States, where a solid candy "dipping stick" is used to convey flavored sugar to the eater's mouth. The dipper is first licked to provide moisture, and then dredged through a small pouch with the flavored sugar, so that the sugar sticks to the dipping stick. Some single-serve ice cream is sold with a flat wooden spade, often erroneously called a "spoon", to lift the product to one's mouth. Prepackaged tuna salad or cracker snacks may contain a flat plastic spade for similar purposes. Over time, these utensils were combined in various ways in attempts to make eating more convenient or to reduce the total number of utensils required. Some utensils are useful only for specific foods.
