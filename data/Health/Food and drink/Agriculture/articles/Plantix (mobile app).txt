Plantix is a mobile crop advisory app for farmers, extension workers and gardeners.   It can diagnose plant diseases, pest damages and nutrient deficiencies affecting crops and offers corresponding treatment measures. Users can participate in the online community to network with other farmers, discuss plant health issues and access their local weather reports. Plantix was developed by PEAT GmbH, a Berlin-based AI startup. PEAT is a spin-off of the Leibniz University of Hannover and has successfully raised two rounds of venture capital, whereas the series A was lead by Index Venture. Due to the Plantix app, PEAT was listed as one of the 6 'Change the World' companies by Fortune Magazine in September 2017.  PEAT was founded in Hanover, Germany in 2015 by Simone Strey, the company's current CEO, Robert Strey, Pierre Munzel, Charlotte Schumann, Alexander Kennepohl, Bianca Kummer and Korbinian Hartberger. PEAT GmbH launched the Plantix app in 2016, but the first spark came as early as 2014 and a first prototype called "Gartenbank" was developed in 2015. Its successor Plantix has built up the world's largest database of plant diseases to help farmers, extension workers and gardeners to diagnose and protect their crops utilizing artificial intelligence and image recognition software.  The declared goal is to develop sustainable and intelligent solutions for tomorrow's agriculture. By November 2017, the Plantix app had more than 1 million Downloads on Android , from more than 155 countries. The company currently employs around 30 people (at 20.03.2018) in the Berlin headquarters and is going to open a further entity in Pune, India in early 2018. The company was featured in major media outlets, including BBC, Fortune, Wired, MIT technology review and has been also awarded with the CeBIT Innovation Award, USAID digital smart farming award and the Worlds Summit Award, by the United Nation.        Plantix is a free mobile application which offers farmers and gardeners the possibility to receive decision support directly on their smartphone. Due to image recognition, the app is able to identify the plant type - as well as the appearance of a possible disease, pest or nutrient deficiency. Plantix takes advantage of deep learning technology which involves neural networks. Furthermore, it provides information on treatment and preventive measures. From the daily new images sent by Plantix users worldwide, the network constantly learns more. This permanent incoming data stream is the basis to providing Plantix users with up-to-date information and alerts in terms of plant diseases, pests and their worldwide distribution in real time. Plantix already cooperates with international research institutes and inter-governmental organizations such as ICRISAT, CIMMYT and CABI. The Agriculture and Horticulture Department of the Government of Andhra Pradesh, India has also already integrated Plantix into its extension services.
