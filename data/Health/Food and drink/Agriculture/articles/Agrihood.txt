Agrihoods are organized communities that integrate agriculture into residential neighborhoods.  The purpose of these communities is to facilitate food production while at the same time providing recreation for members of the community. The trend of moving to agrihoods has been noted by a number of sources to be more common among millennials.       Agrihoods are based around the concept of integrating farms and gardens into neighborhoods, or vice versa.  This integration in turn allows for communities to supply themselves with food. Most of this food production is heavily influenced by organic and sustainable agriculture.
