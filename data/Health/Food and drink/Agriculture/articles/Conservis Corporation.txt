Conservis Corporation is a Minneapolis-based company that provides enterprise resource planning software to farmers.   The company was founded in 2009 when four farmers asked Pat Christie and Eric Jackson for help with workflow management. Prior to this, the company was planning to enter the energy enterprise software and emissions trading sector but decided to not enter it due to the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 not getting through the US Congress.  Conservis manages over $8 billion in land, equipment and crop assets at all stages of agricultural production to improve financial performance.  The Companyâ€™s cloud-based platform offers business-oriented farms service-centric software to track field activities, manage resources and make better decisions.  It provides a wide range of software products for inputs management, harvest management, planning, budgeting, work orders and analytics.  It currently does business in the United States, Australia, Russia, Ukraine and Argentina. The company has raised $30 million to date in its Series A and Bridge rounds. It is preparing for a Series B funding round. Its investors include Cultivian Sandbox, Middleland Capital, Pontifax AgTech, Florida Gulfshore Capital, Heartland Farms and the Broe Group.  Robert B. Shapiro, former CEO of Monsanto, is on its board of directors.  Conservis has collaborated with Iteris to provide weather data and analytics to farmers.
