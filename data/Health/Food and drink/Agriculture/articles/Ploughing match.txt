A ploughing match is a contest between people who each plough part of a field.  Nowadays there are usually classes for horse-drawn ploughs and for tractor ploughing.  Points are awarded for straightness and neatness of the resulting furrows.. The annual 3-day long Irish National Ploughing Championships has grown into one of the largest outdoor events in the world, with commercial exhibits and a significant national media presence.  In Ontario, the International Plowing Match is an important rural event.
