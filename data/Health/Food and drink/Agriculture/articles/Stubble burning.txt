Stubble burning is the deliberate setting fire of the straw stubble that remains after wheat and other grains have been harvested. The practice was widespread until the 1990s, when governments increasingly restricted its use. The burning of stubble, contrasted with alternatives such as ploughing the stubble back into the ground has a number of consequences and effects on the environment  Stubble burning: However, it has a number of harmful effects on the environment: There is a perception that stubble burning contributes to atmospheric CO2. However carbon dioxide releases are only slightly greater than those from natural decomposition  Stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana  in northwest India has been cited as a major cause of air pollution in Delhi.  From late September through October of each year, farmers mainly from Punjab and Haryana burn an estimated 35 million tons  of crop waste from their wheat fields after harvesting, as a low-cost straw-disposal practice to reduce the turnaround time between harvesting and sowing for the second (winter) crop.   Smoke from this burning produces a cloud of particulates visible in images from space,  and has produced a "toxic cloud" in New Delhi, resulting in declarations of an air-pollution emergency.  For this, NGT (National Green Tribunal) slapped a fine of Rs. 2 lakh on the Delhi Government for not filing an action plan providing incentives and infrastructural assistance to farmers to stop them from burning crop residue to prevent air pollution.  Although harvesters are available such as the Indian-manufactured "Happy Seeder" that shred the crop residues into small pieces and uniformly spread them across the field, as an alternative to burning the crops, farmers complain that the cost of these machines is prohibitive compared to burning the fields.  1.Causing lung cancer 2.Heart diseases
