Paludiculture is wet agriculture and forestry on peatlands . Paludiculture combines the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from drained peatlands through rewetting with continued land use and biomass production under wet conditions  . Peatlands store an enormous amount of carbon. Covering only 3 % of the land surface they store more than 450 GT of carbon which is more than the amount of carbon stored by forests (covering 30% of the land surface)  ,  . Drained peatlands cause numerous negative environmental impacts such as greenhouse gas and nutrient emissions, subsidence and loss of biodiversity. Although only 0.3 % of all peatlands are drained, peatland drainage is responsible for 6 % of all human greenhouse gas emission  . Peatland rewetting significantly reduces environmental impacts caused by drainage. The Database of Potential Paludiculture plants (DPPP) lists more than 1,000 wetland plants  , but only a minor fraction is suitable for paludiculture. Examples for potential and tested paludicultures are provided in the table below. Tab. Examples for potential and tested paludicultures (modified after  ,  ).
