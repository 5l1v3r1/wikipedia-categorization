Phytobiome is a term that relates to a plant (phyto) in a specific ecological area (biome). It includes the plant itself, the environment and all micro- and macro-organisms living in, on, or around the plant. These organisms include microbes, animals and other plants. The environment includes the soil, air and climate. Examples of ecological areas are fields, rangelands, forests.  Knowledge of the interactions within a phytobiome can be used to create tools for agriculture, crop management , increased health, preservation, productivity, and sustainability of cropping and forest systems.   In 2015 the American Phytopathological Society (APS) launched a research framework, the Phytobiomes Initiative, to facilitate the organization of research into phytobiome.  As part of this effort, in 2016 it launched Phytobiomes, an open-access journal. The journal focuses on transdisciplinary research that impacts the entire plant ecosystem.  An overall research strategy has been published in the Phytobiomes Roadmap, a document developed by a group of scientific societies, companies, research institutes, and governmental agencies. It is intended to present a strategic plan to study phytobiomes and propose an action plan to apply phytobiome studies.   The connected Phytobiomes Alliance is an international, nonprofit consortium of academic institutions, large and small companies, and governmental agencies coordinating public-private research projects on various aspects of agriculturally relevant phytobiomes.
