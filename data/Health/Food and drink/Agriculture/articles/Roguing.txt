In agriculture, roguing refers to the act of identifying and removing plants with undesirable characteristics from agricultural fields. Rogues are removed from the fields to preserve the quality of the crop being grown. That is, the plants being removed may be diseased, be of an unwanted variety, or undesirable for other reasons.  For example, to ensure that the crop retains its integrity as regards certain physical attributes, such as color and shape, individual plants that exhibit differing traits are removed.  Roguing is particularly important when growing seed crops to prevent plants with undesirable characteristics from propagating into subsequent generations.
