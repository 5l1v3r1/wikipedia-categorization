It focuses mainly on horticulture, dairy, poultry and fisheries sector.\nWhile most definitions of diversification in developing countries do work on the assumption that diversification primarily involves a substitution of one crop or other agricultural product for another, or an increase in the number of enterprises, or activities, carried out by a particular farm, the definition used in developed countries sometimes relates more to the development of activities on the farm that do not involve agricultural production. For example, one section of the British <a href=\"/wiki/Department_for_Environment,_Food_and_Rural_Affairs\" title=\"Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs\">Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs</a> (DEFRA) defines diversification as \u201cthe entrepreneurial use of farm resources for a non-agricultural purpose for commercial gain\u201d. Using this definition DEFRA found that 56% of UK farms had diversified in 2003. The great majority of diversification activities simply involved the renting out of farm buildings for non-farming use, but 9% of farms had become involved with processing or retailing, 3% with provision of tourist accommodation or catering, and 7% with sport or recreational activities.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> Others adopt a broader definition, which may include development of new marketing opportunities.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In developing countries such as India, which has been one of the leaders in promoting diversification, the concept is applied both to individual farmers and to different regions, with government programmes being aimed at promoting widespread diversification. The concept in India is seen as referring to the \u201cshift from the regional dominance of one crop to regional production of a number of crops ...... (which takes into account)..... the economic returns from different value-added crops... with complementary marketing opportunities\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Drivers_of_diversification\">Drivers of diversification</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Agricultural_diversification&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Drivers of diversification\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Diversification can be a response to both opportunities and threats.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Opportunities\">Opportunities</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Agricultural_diversification&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Opportunities\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<ul><li><b>Changing consumer demand</b>. As consumers in developing countries become richer, food consumption patterns change noticeably. People move away from a diet based on staples to one with a greater content of animal products (meat, eggs, and dairy) and fruits and vegetables. In turn, more dynamic farmers are able to diversify to meet these needs.</li>\n<li><b>Changing demographics</b>. Rapid urbanization in developing countries affects consumption patterns. Moreover, a smaller number of farmers, in percentage terms at least, has to supply a larger number of consumers. While this may not imply diversification it does require adaptation to new farming techniques to meet higher demand.</li>\n<li><b>Export potential</b>. Developing country farmers have had considerable success by diversifying into crops that can meet export market demand. While concern about <a href=\"/wiki/Food_miles\" title=\"Food miles\">food miles</a>, as well as the cost of complying with <a href=\"/wiki/Supermarket\" title=\"Supermarket\">supermarket</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Certification\" title=\"Certification\">certification</a> requirements such as for <a href=\"/wiki/GlobalGAP\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"GlobalGAP\">GlobalGAP</a> may jeopardize this success in the long run, there remains much potential to diversify to meet export markets.</li>\n<li><b>Adding value</b>. The pattern witnessed in the West, and now becoming widespread in developing countries, is for consumers to devote less and less time to food preparation. They increasingly require ready-prepared meals and labour-saving packaging, such as pre-cut <a href=\"/wiki/Salads\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Salads\">salads</a>. This provides the opportunity for farmers to diversify into value addition, particularly in countries where supermarkets play a major role in <a href=\"/wiki/Retailing\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Retailing\">retailing</a>.</li>\n<li><b>Changing marketing opportunities</b>. The changing of government policies that control the way in which farmers can link to markets can open up new diversification possibilities. For example, in <a href=\"/wiki/India\" title=\"India\">India</a>, policy changes to remove the monopoly of state \u201cregulated markets\u201d to handle all transactions made it possible for farmers to establish direct <a href=\"/wiki/Contract_farming\" title=\"Contract farming\">contracts</a> with buyers for new products.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup></li>\n<li><b>Improving nutrition</b>. Diversifying from the <a href=\"/wiki/Monoculture\" title=\"Monoculture\">monoculture</a> of traditional <a href=\"/wiki/Staple_food\" title=\"Staple food\">staples</a> can have important nutritional benefits for farmers in developing countries.</li></ul>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Threats\">Threats</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Agricultural_diversification&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Threats\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<ul><li><b>Urbanization</b>. This is both an opportunity and a threat, in that the expansion of cities places pressure on land resources and puts up the value of the land. If farmers are to remain on the land they need to generate greater income from that land than they could by growing basic staples. This fact, and the proximity of markets, explains why farmers close to urban areas tend to diversify into high-value crops.</li>\n<li><b>Risk</b>. Farmers face risk from bad weather and from fluctuating prices. Diversification is a logical response to both. For example, some crops are more drought-resistant than others, but may offer poorer economic returns. A <a href=\"/wiki/Diversification_(finance)\" title=\"Diversification (finance)\">diversified portfolio</a> of products should ensure that farmers do not suffer complete ruin when the weather is bad. Similarly, diversification can manage price risk, on the assumption that not all products will suffer low prices at the same time. In fact, farmers often do the opposite of diversification by planting products that have a high price in one year, only to see the price collapse in the next, as explained by the <a href=\"/wiki/Cobweb_theory\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cobweb theory\">cobweb theory</a>.</li>\n<li><b>External threats</b>. Farmers who are dependent on exports run the risk that conditions will change in their markets, not because of a change in consumer demand but because of policy changes. A classic example is the <a href=\"/wiki/Caribbean\" title=\"Caribbean\">Caribbean</a> banana industry, which collapsed as a result of the removal of <a href=\"/wiki/Import_quota\" title=\"Import quota\">quota</a> protection on EU markets, necessitating diversification by the region\u2019s farmers.</li>\n<li><b>Domestic policy threats</b>. Agricultural production is sometimes undertaken as a consequence of government <a href=\"/wiki/Subsidies\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Subsidies\">subsidies</a>, rather than because it is inherently profitable. The reduction or removal of those subsidies, whether direct or indirect, can have a major effect on farmers and provide a significant incentive for diversification or, in some cases, for returning to production of crops grown prior to the introduction of subsidies.</li>\n<li><b>Climate change</b>. The type of crop that can be grown is affected by changes in temperatures and the length of the growing season. Climate change could also modify the availability of water for production. Farmers in several countries, including <a href=\"/wiki/Canada\" title=\"Canada\">Canada</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/India\" title=\"India\">India</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Kenya\" title=\"Kenya\">Kenya</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Mozambique\" title=\"Mozambique\">Mozambique</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Sri_Lanka\" title=\"Sri Lanka\">Sri Lanka</a> have already initiated diversification as a response to climate change. Government policy in Kenya to promote crop diversification has included the removal of subsidies for some crops, encouraging land-use zoning and introducing differential land tax systems.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Opportunities_for_diversification\">Opportunities for diversification</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Agricultural_diversification&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Opportunities for diversification\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In making decisions about diversification farmers need to consider whether income generated by new farm enterprises will be greater than the existing activities, with similar or less risk. While growing new crops or raising animals may be technically possible, these may not be suitable for many farmers in terms of their land, labour and capital resources. Moreover, markets for the products may be lacking.  The <a href=\"/wiki/United_Nations_Food_and_Agriculture_Organization\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization\">United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization</a> (FAO) has been one of the development organizations promoting diversification by small farmers and has produced booklets identifying beekeeping, mushroom farming, milk production, fish ponds and sheep and goats, among others, as diversification possibilities.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Measures_of_diversification\">Measures of diversification</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Agricultural_diversification&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Measures of diversification\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Agricultural diversification is measured in a number of ways throughout the world.
