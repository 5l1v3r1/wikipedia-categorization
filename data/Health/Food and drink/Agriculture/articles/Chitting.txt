Chitting is a method of preparing potatoes or other tubers for planting.  The seed potatoes are placed in a tray (often in egg cartons) in a light and cool place.  All but three or four of the "eyes" (sprouting parts) of the potato are removed, leaving the strongest growths only.  After the sprouts are about 1 inch (2.5Â cm) long, the seed potatoes are planted in the ground.
