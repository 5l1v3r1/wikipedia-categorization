In the United States, agricultural protection zoning refers to local zoning codes that include provisions such as large lot size requirements and use limitations to separate farming and related activities from other land uses. Some jurisdictions further subdivide agricultural zones, so as to distinguish full-time commercial farming from a mix of uses that might include rural residence farms and retirement farms on very large lots.
