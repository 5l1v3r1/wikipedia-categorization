They help products to be the same in consistency, they are quick and easy to use in batch production of food products. Some examples are pre-made stock cubes, marzipan, icing, ready made pastry. Manufacturers use standard components as they save time and sometimes cost a lot less and it also helps with consistency in products. If a manufacturer is to use a standard component from another supplier it is essential that a precise and accurate specification is produced by the manufacturer so that the component meets the standards set by the manufacturer.
