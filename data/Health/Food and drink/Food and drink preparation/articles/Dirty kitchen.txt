A dirty kitchen is an outdoor kitchen in the Philippines, Kuwait, Bahrain and many other West Asian countries either separate from or adjoining the main house, the reasons for which isolation or separation includes fire safety, keeping the smoke and fuel smell out, and keeping charcoal dust and oil grime out.     Rural versions of the dirty kitchen have firewood-run stoves on kitchen tables literally made of dirt.
