Gomul (고물) refers to a number of powdered coatings, toppings, fillings, or dips in Korean cuisine. Gomul is used to improve the appearance and taste of tteok (rice cake), including injeolmi, danja, and gyeongdan, as well as between-layer fillings for siru-tteok (steamed rice cake).     It helps with even cooking of steamed rice cakes, being the less dense layer (compared to the rice flour layer, which tend to turn stickier as steams) through which steam passes more easily.  Gomul is also used for topping bingsu (shaved ice). Sometimes, soybean gomul is served with grilled samgyeopsal (pork belly), with meat dipped in the soybean powder when eaten. Red bean or mung bean gomul is used in winter, while soybean or sesame gomul, which don't spoil as fast, are preferred in summer.  Common varieties and their preparation are:   Gyeongdan coated with various gomul Danja coated with bam-daechu-gomul (chestnut and jujube strands) Injeolmi coated with kong-gomul (soybean powder) Gyeongdan coated with gomul Siru-tteok filled with pat-gomul (red bean powder) Injeolmi coated with heugimja-gomul (black sesame powder) Gyeongdan coated with various gomul Bingsu topped with kong-gomul (soybean powder) Yeot coated with kong-gomul (soybean powder) Kong-gomul (soybean powder) for dipping samgyeopsal (pork belly)
