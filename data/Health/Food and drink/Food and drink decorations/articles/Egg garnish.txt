Egg garnish, called al-gomyeong (알고명) in Korean, is a common topping in Korean cuisine, made with egg whites and egg yolks.     Egg yolks and egg whites are separated, beaten without creating foam, pan-fried with little oil into thin sheets without browning, then cut into thin strips, diamonds, or rectangles.   The white and yellow egg sheets before being cut are called jidan (지단).
