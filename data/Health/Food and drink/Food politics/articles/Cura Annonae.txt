In ancient Rome, the Roman government used the term Cura Annonae ("care for the grain supply"), in honour of their goddess Annona, to describe the import and distribution of grain to the residents of the city of Rome.  A dole of subsidized or free grain, and later bread, was provided to hundreds of thousands of the poorer residents of the city of Rome.  The grain was distributed from the Temple of Ceres.   The Aedile took care of the grain supply (Cura Annonae) as part of his duties. The grain dole was part of the Roman leadership's strategy of maintaining tranquility among a restive urban population by providing them with what the poet Juvenal sarcastically called "bread and circuses."   The supply of grain to the residents of Rome was crucial for the stability of Rome.  In 22 CE, the emperor Tiberius said that the Cura Annonae if neglected would be 'the utter ruin of the state."   The most important sources of the grain, mostly durum wheat, were Egypt, North Africa, and Sicily. The logistics of moving the grain by sea from those places to Rome were extensive, as was the distribution system inside Rome itself.      The city of Rome grew rapidly in the centuries of the Roman Republic and Empire, reaching a population approaching one million in the second century CE.  The population of the city grew beyond the capacity of the nearby rural areas to meet the food needs of the city.  In addition to the need for commercial imports of grain to Rome, free or subsidized grain was distributed to a large percentage of the Roman population.   In the early centuries of the Republic, the Roman government intervened sporadically to distribute free or subsidized grain to its population.  Regular distribution began in 123 BCE with a grain law proposed by Gaius Gracchus and approved by the Roman popular assembly. Adult male citizens (over 14 years of age) of Rome were entitled to buy at a below-market price five "modii", about 33 kilograms (73 lb), of grain monthly. Approximately 40,000 adult males were eligible for the grain. In 62 and 58 BCE the number of Romans eligible for grain was expanded and grain became free to its recipients.  The numbers of those receiving free or subsidized grain expanded to an estimated 320,000 before being reduced to 150,000 by Julius Caesar and then set at 200,000 by Augustus Caesar, a number that remained more or less stable until near the end of the Western Roman Empire.    In the 3rd century CE, the dole of grain was replaced by bread, probably during the reign of Septimius Severus (193-211 CE).  Severus also began providing olive oil to residents of Rome, and later the emperor Aurelian (270-275) ordered the distribution of wine and pork.  The doles of bread, olive oil, wine, and pork apparently continued until near the end of the Western Roman Empire in 476 CE, although the decline in the population of the city of Rome reduced the quantities of food required.  By the late 200s BCE, grain was being shipped to the city of Rome from Sicily and Sardinia. In the first century BCE, the three major sources of wheat were Sardinia, Sicily, and Africa, i.e. the region around the ancient city of Carthage, present day Tunisia.  With the incorporation of Egypt into the Roman empire and the rule of the emperor Augustus (27 BCE-14 CE), Egypt became the main source of supply of grain for Rome.  By the 70s CE, the historian Josephus was claiming that Africa fed Rome for eight months of the year and Egypt only four.  Although that statement may ignore grain from Sicily, and overestimate the importance of Africa, there is little doubt among historians that Africa and Egypt were the most important sources of grain for Rome.  To help assure that the grain supply would be adequate for Rome, in the first century BCE, Graccus settled 6,000 colonists near Carthage, giving them about 25 hectares (62 acres) each to grow grain.   Grain made into bread was, by far, the most important element in the Roman diet.  Several scholars have attempted to compute the total amount of grain need to supply the city of Rome.  Rickman estimated that Rome needed 40 million modii (200,000 metric tons) of grain per year to feed its population.   Erdkamp estimated that the amount needed would be at least 150,000 metric tons, calculating that each resident of the city consumed 200 kilograms (440 lb) of grain per month.   The total population of Rome assumed in calculating these estimates was between 750,000 and one million people.  David Mattingly and Gregory Aldrete,   estimated the amount of imported grain at 237,000 metric tons for 1 million inhabitants, man, woman and child, enough for 1.4 pounds of bread each day, not calculating wastage and spoilage;  This amount of grain would provide 2,326 calories daily per person not including other foods such as meats, seafood, fruit, legumes, vegetable and dairy. The shipping lanes that connected Rome with its centers of grain supply (Egypt, North Africa, Sicily and perhaps other places.) thus had great strategic importance. Whoever controlled the grain supply had an important measure of control over the city of Rome. Rome was dependent upon the prompt arrival of imported grain.    The provision of grain to Rome was a major shipping and administrative task for the Romans.  It was not feasible to supply Rome's needs by land transport. It was "cheaper to ship grain from one end of the Mediterranean to the other" by sea than "to cart it by land some 75 miles [120 kilometers]."  Thus, a large fleet of sea-worthy grain ships was required to bring grain from relatively nearby Sicily and Sardinia, more distant North Africa, and much more distant Egypt.  In straight line distances (and sailing ships did not normally travel in straight lines), distances from Sicily to Rome were more than 500 kilometres (310 mi), from Carthage in North Africa more than 600 kilometres (370 mi), and from Egypt more than 2,000 kilometres (1,200 mi). Sailing times from the ports of Ostia (near Rome) and Puteoli (near Naples) to Alexandria in Egypt might be accomplished in as little as 14 days.  Returning to Rome would take much longer as the winds were adverse and ships had to hug coastlines and travel in a round-about manner.  Given also the time needed for loading and unloading the grain ships by hand, the ships traversing the Egypt to Rome route likely only completed one round trip per year. Several round trips per year could be accomplished from North Africa or Sicily. Spain was also an important source of olive oil, and possibly grain.  Hundreds or even thousands of ships were required to transport grain to Rome. The government of Rome encouraged building large ships for grain transport.  Some had a capacity of carrying 50,000 modii (350 tons) or even more.  Ships of much larger capacity are suggested in Lucian and the Acts of the Apostles.  Grain transport presented special problems.  Grain must be kept cool and dry to prevent sprouting and infestations of pests and mold and prevented from shifting from side to side in the hold of the ship which could impact the seaworthiness of the transport ship. Grain that was wet could sink the ship by expanding and splitting the sideboards of the hull.  Lucian, c. 150 CE, described a very large grain ship taking shelter in the port of Piraeus, Greece.  The Isis was 55 metres (180 ft) in length and had a beam of more than a quarter of that.  From the deck to the bottom of the cargo hold was 13 metres (43 ft). Lionel Casson calculated that the cargo capacity was 1200 to 1300 metric tons of grain. an estimate that has not been verified by archaeological findings.  That grain ships were propelled entirely by sails.  Casson reconstructed a voyage from Alexandria, Egypt to Rome.  A grain ship leaving Alexandria, would first steer north east to Cyprus, then follow the south coast of Asia Minor (21st century Turkey) westwards, and proceed along the south shore of Crete, stopping as needed at one of several ports enroute.  From Crete the grain ship would strike out across the Mediterranean Sea westwards toward the island of Malta, the objective being Syracuse in Sicily and the Straits of Messina.  Passing through the Straits, the grain ship would dock at the port of Puteoli, near Naples, or after port improvements in about 113 CE at Ostia, near Rome. From Puteoli the cargo would be off-loaded onto smaller ships and taken to Rome.          "The voyage...from Alexandria to Rome was a continuous fight against foul winds." Casson estimates that average time for the voyage was nearly 70 days.  The voyage of Paul. The experience of Paul the Apostle in 62 CE illustrates the dangers of the voyage from Egypt to Rome. Paul boarded a Rome-bound grain ship in Asia Minor. The ship was large, with 276 people, crew and passengers, aboard. It was late in the sailing season, after the Day of Atonement (probably late October or November) and the winds were adverse.  Following the route off the south shore of Crete, Paul's ship was blown off course and wrecked on the island of Malta. He spent the winter on Malta, the proceeding onward to Puteoli and then to Rome.  The widespread use of water mills or grain crushers in Italy is mentioned in passing by Pliny the Elder in 79 AD. A sequence of water mills was established at the terminus of the highest Roman aqueduct, the Aqua Traiana in the second century AD by the emperor Trajan. Traces of the water channels and equipment have been excavated on the Janiculum. Protecting this valuable industrial complex was important, as attested by the actions of Belisarius in the Siege of Rome (537–538) when the city was besieged by the Ostrogoths. When the water supply to the aqueduct was cut off, he built a bridge of boats across the Tiber and used floating paddle mills to crush the grain, and so kept the supply of bread intact. The complex of mills bear parallels with a similar complex at Barbegal in southern Gaul built in the first century AD, although the Barbegal mills have not been built upon at later times, and are thus extremely well preserved. Throughout most of the Republican era, the care of the grain supply (cura annonae) was part of the aedile's duties. The annona was personified as a goddess, and the grain dole was distributed from the Temple of Ceres. As early as 440 BC, however,  the Roman Senate may have appointed a special officer called the praefectus annonae with greatly extended powers.   An emergency cura annonae was an important source of influence and power for Pompey in his later career. Under the Principate, the position of praefectus annonae became permanent, while a range of privileges, including grants of citizenship and exemption from certain duties, were extended to ship-owners who signed contracts to transport grain to the city. A large part of the city's supply was obtained through the free market. Prices in the city were invariably high, and merchants could count on making a profit. Grain was also collected as tax in kind from certain provinces; some of this was distributed to officials and soldiers and some was sold at market rates. Grain supply was an important issue for the Gracchi, with the elder brother Tiberius Gracchus arguing that consolidation of Roman agricultural lands in the hands of a few had pushed landless Romans into the city, where they found poverty rather than employment. The grain supply was a consistent plank in the popularist platform for political leaders who appealed to the plebs.  But the unpopularity of these laws led to more conservative laws attempting to rein in the Gracchi reforms such as the lex Octavia and the lex Terentia Cassia.  The price of grain became a major issue when the Roman province of Sicily revolted repeatedly, thus pushing the price to unaffordable levels. Lowering grain prices became an important part of the political platform of the radical popularist Saturninus, who acquired the office of plebeian tribune an unusual three times. The official responsible for the provision of the alimenta was the Curator alimentorum. During the empire, this post became an important bureaucratic position to be filled by the senatorial elite prior to achieving a consulship. The last known official to hold this post was Titus Flavius Postumius Quietus, probably during the early 270s.  Later emperors all used free or greatly subsidized grain to keep the populace fed. The political use of the grain supply along with gladiatorial games and other entertainments gave rise to the saying "Bread and circuses" from one of the bitter satires of Juvenal (60-140 A.D) as if the population of the city did nothing but live off free grain and go to entertainments (circus races were actually held on average only 17 days a year and gladiatorial shows 5-7 days in a year).  The machinery of the Annona civilis became more complex over time.  With the devaluation of currency in the course of the third century, the army was paid in rationed supplies (annonae) as well as in specie from the later third century, through a cumbrous administration of collection and redistribution. The role of the state in distributing the annona remained a central feature of its unity and power: "the cessation of this state function in the fifth century was a major factor leading to economic fragmentation, as was the end of the grain requisition for the city of Rome"
