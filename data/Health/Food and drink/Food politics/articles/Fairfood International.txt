Fairfood is an Amsterdam based non-profit organization that advocates a sustainable and fair global food system. The organization strives for a food system in which people live and work in dignity, the environment is respected and in which there is social and economic value for everyone involved.  Fairfood was founded in 2002 by several volunteers, soon to grow into a professional organization, led by director Eelco Fortuijn. Anselm Iwundu was the Executive Director of Fairfood International from August 2011 until June 2015. As of 2016 Sander de Jong has taken on this role. At the moment Fairfood employs approximately 5 staff members, and a number of volunteers. In 2013, Fairfood International had a global revenue of €2,306,487 - 47% of this revenue comes from the Dutch Government. In 2017 a new logo and corporate identity were launched.  In 2015 the United Nations launched the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG's). These 17 goals must have put an end to poverty, inequality and climate change by 2030. Fairfood is contributing to 6 of the 17 goals: Goal 1: No Poverty Goal 2: Zero Hunger Goal 5: Gender Equality Goal 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth Goal 10: Reduced Inequalities Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production Fairfood started the Living Wage Lab, together with Hivos, in order to help companies in the agri-food sector find solutions for the payment of a living wage in their supply chains. Agri-food companies are often not able to solve the problem of low wages alone. That is why the Living Wage Lab brings together representatives from government, trade unions, producers, retailers, NGOs, certification agencies and researchers in order to come up with solutions. The Living Wage Lab follows the approach of the ‘change lab’: a social innovation process in which stakeholders work together on a complex problem. Solutions are found in new technologies, new policy, new business models, and other forms of cooperation.
