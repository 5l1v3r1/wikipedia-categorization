  DAD-IS is the acronym of the worldwide Domestic Animal Diversity Information System of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, within the FAO's management of animal genetic resources programme.  It includes a searchable database of information about breeds, the Global Databank for Animal Genetic Resources; it also holds tools for management, and contacts for the National and Regional Coordinators for the programme.  Data from the Global Databank is used for reporting on the global status and trends of animal genetic resources. The fourth version of the DAD-IS was launched on 21 November 2017.  There were 11,116 mammalian national breed populations in DAD-IS as of February 2016, and 3,799 avian national breed populations.  These national breed populations represent a global total of 8,822 breeds, which includes 643 breeds (7%) that are reported to be extinct.   local breeds (only found in one region) make up 7,761 of entries, while 1,061 are transboundary breeds, meaning they are found in more than one region. A total of 17% (about 1,500) of all DAD-IS breeds are classified as being at risk of extinction, though this figure includes those that are already extinct but were entered into the database before disappearing. A further 58% are classified as being of unknown risk status. Template:As of 2016 these risk statuses have not been updated since 2014.  Figure 1: Total Number of Livestock Breeds by region. Local and regional transboundary breeds are combined and international transboundary breeds are ones that are found in more than 1 country. Note : Figures exclude extinct breeds. Figures for Alpaca, American bison, deer, dog, dromedary × Bactrian camel, guanaco, llama, vicuña, cassowary, Chilean tinamou, duck × Muscovy duck, emu, guinea fowl, ñandu, peacock, quail and swallow are combined in the “others” category.
