A treef (Surinamese Dutch, derived from Sranantongo trefu) is a food taboo. In Suriname there certain groups have long adhered to belief in treef, especially among the African descendants. The consumption of certain foods is prohibited for some, on the belief that it could cause major diseases, particularly leprosy.  These prohibitions can vary individually, but it is inextricably related to conditions in the family. A treef is inherited from the father's side, but it can be revealed in a dream, often by a woman. In addition, a woman must take into account special food taboos during pregnancy. There is great importance attached to the treef; if a child observes the treef of his father, and yet experiences a skin condition, this is seen as a strong indication that the child was begotten by the woman with another man. Finally treef also be acquired later in life by wearing certain charms that compel you to abstain from certain foods.   The word is derived from Hebrew, due to influence from Portuguese-speaking Jews who came to Suriname in the 17th century. This is also the source of Sranan kaseri 'ritually clean, kosher'.
