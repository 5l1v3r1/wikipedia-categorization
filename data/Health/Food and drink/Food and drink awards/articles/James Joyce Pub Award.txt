The James Joyce Pub Award was presented by "Bloomsday Publications" to a number of pubs in Ireland and the United States deemed as 'Authentic' Irish pubs on Bloomsday in the year 2000. As commemoration of the award, a plaque featuring a bust of James Joyce and an excerpt from Ulysses (novel) was presented to the award winners. Partial List of Award Winners In no particular order: There are many other winners both in Ireland and the United States that are not captured in the above table. Since the awards were distributed in 2000, surplus awards that were manufactured but not awarded to a specific establishment, commonly appear on the secondary market from various pub equipment suppliers. As such, the presence of a genuine plaque does not guarantee that the award was bestowed on the specific establishment. In some cases, establishments which were not yet open when the original awards were dispersed, have been known to display the award as if they had been an original recipient.
