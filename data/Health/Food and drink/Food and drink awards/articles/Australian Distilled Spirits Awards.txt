  Australian Distilled Spirits Awards (ADSA) is an annual  competition that commenced in 2015.  The ADSA is undertaken by the Royal Agricultural Society of Victoria (RASV) in conjunction with the Australian Distillers Association.   Judging of the awards is conducted at Melbourne Showgrounds, with the Awards presentation dinner held in March in Melbourne, Australia.    In 2017, the ADSA introduced two new trophies to reflect evolving production techniques - Champion Aromatic Bitters and Champion Micro Lot.
