The Salt Lick Award is an award given to Canadian manufacturers of foods that demonstrate high sodium levels. The name refers to salt licks. The award is given by the Canadian Stroke Network, the Canadian Obesity Network and the Advanced Foods and Materials Network. Some of the baby and toddler foods examined by the two groups had no added sodium, while other foods had levels considered excessive.  The Salt Lick Award is part of World Salt Awareness Week.
