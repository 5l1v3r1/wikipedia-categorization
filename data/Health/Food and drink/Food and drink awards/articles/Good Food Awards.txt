The Good Food Awards or GFAs is an annual award competition for outstanding American craft food producers and the farmers who provide their ingredients. Created by the Good Food Foundation (formerly Seedling Projects), the Good Food Awards celebrate the kind of food we all want to eat: tasty, authentic and responsibly produced. An annual Awards Ceremony and Marketplace is held to honor the Good Food Award recipients who push their industries towards craftsmanship and sustainability while enhancing our agricultural landscape and building strong communities.   The Good Food Awards have been particularly notable in the coffee industry.  As of the 2018 Good Food Awards, Patric Chocolate has won twenty-one awards, more than any other entrant. The criteria for the Good Food Awards varies by industry, however basic rules says that entries must be made without GM ingredients, using good animal husbandry and "without the use of artificial ingredients, hormones, synthetic pesticides, herbicides, fertilizer " and, most importantly, crafted in the USA.
