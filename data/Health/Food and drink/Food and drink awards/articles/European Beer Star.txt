The European Beer Star is a beer competition, held in 2013 for the tenth time. Consideration is given to types of beer which have their origins in Europe. All breweries can participate: local, regional, national and worldwide operating breweries, not only from Europe but from all countries.  Prizes are awarded to the beers which best fulfill the respective type criteria, and whose taste and quality impresses the most. In 2012, more than 1,300 beers were tested, an increase of 23% compared with 2011. This award has been initiated by the associations Private Brauereien Deutschland, Private Brauereien Bayern and SIB - the association of small and independent breweries of Europe. The tasting is carried out by an expert jury, of independent beer experts from across the world. The yardstick is not the technical laboratory analysis, but a rating from the consumer's viewpoint of sense and taste. The aim of the blind tasting is to find the beers which best fulfill the type criteria of each category and whose taste as well as quality are the most convincing. In each category, the three best beers are awarded a gold, silver and bronze medal. Less than three prizes will be awarded if there are no three beers which meet the specified quality and category standards. Visitors to Brau Beviale, a trade fair for the international beverage industry held in Nuremberg, will have the opportunity to cast their vote which beer they prefer.
