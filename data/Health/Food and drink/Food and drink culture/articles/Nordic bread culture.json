During the <a href=\"/wiki/Iron_Age\" title=\"Iron Age\">Iron Age</a> (500 AD \u2013 1050 AD), rye became the most commonly used grain, followed by barley and oats. Rye was also the most commonly used grain for bread up until the beginning of the 20th century. Today, older grain types such as <a href=\"/wiki/Emmer\" title=\"Emmer\">emmer</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Spelt\" title=\"Spelt\">spelt</a> are once again being cultivated and new bread types are being developed from these grains.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Archaeology\" title=\"Archaeology\">Archaeological</a> finds in <a href=\"/wiki/Denmark\" title=\"Denmark\">Denmark</a> indicate use of the two triticum (wheat) species, emmer and <a href=\"/wiki/Einkorn\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Einkorn\">einkorn</a>, during the <a href=\"/wiki/Mesolithic_Period\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Mesolithic Period\">Mesolithic Period</a> (8900 BC \u2013 3900 BC). There is no direct evidence of bread-making, but cereals have been crushed, cooked and served as <a href=\"/wiki/Porridge\" title=\"Porridge\">porridge</a> since at least 4,200 BC. During the <a href=\"/wiki/Neolithic_Period\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Neolithic Period\">Neolithic Period</a> (3900 BC \u2013 1800 BC), when <a href=\"/wiki/Agriculture\" title=\"Agriculture\">agriculture</a> was introduced, barley seems to have taken over to some extent, and <a href=\"/wiki/Ceramic\" title=\"Ceramic\">ceramic</a> plates apparently used for baking are found. Moulded cereals, with water added to make a <a href=\"/wiki/Dough\" title=\"Dough\">dough</a> and baked or <a href=\"/wiki/Frying\" title=\"Frying\">fried</a> in the shape of bread, are known as <a href=\"/wiki/Grave_goods\" title=\"Grave goods\">burial gifts</a> in Iron Age graves (200 AD onwards) in the <a href=\"/wiki/M%C3%A4lardalen\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"M\u00e4lardalen\">M\u00e4lardalen</a> area of central <a href=\"/wiki/Sweden\" title=\"Sweden\">Sweden</a>.

During the <a href=\"/wiki/Bronze_Age\" title=\"Bronze Age\">Bronze Age</a> (1800 BC \u2013 500 AD), oats and the triticum species spelt seem to have been the most commonly used grains, and we see the first real <a href=\"/wiki/Oven\" title=\"Oven\">ovens</a>, probably used for baking small loaves and perhaps the first bread (probably around 400 AD).\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Scandinavia\" title=\"Scandinavia\">Scandinavian</a> soldiers in <a href=\"/wiki/Roman_times\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Roman times\">Roman times</a> apparently learned baking techniques when working as <a href=\"/wiki/Mercenaries\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Mercenaries\">mercenaries</a> in the <a href=\"/wiki/Roman_army\" title=\"Roman army\">Roman army</a> (200\u2013400 AD).

Culturally, <a href=\"/wiki/Germany\" title=\"Germany\">German</a> traditions have influenced most of the bread types in the Nordic countries.

Four different bread regions can be found in the Nordic area in the late 19th century. In the south, soft <a href=\"/wiki/Rye_bread\" title=\"Rye bread\">rye bread</a> dominated. Further north came <a href=\"/wiki/Crisp_bread\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Crisp bread\">crisp bread</a>, usually baked with rye, then thin and crispy <a href=\"/wiki/Barley_bread\" title=\"Barley bread\">barley bread</a>. In the far north, soft barley loaves dominated. During the 19th century, <a href=\"/wiki/Potato\" title=\"Potato\">potatoes</a> began to become the centrepiece of meals and bread was put aside as an extra source of <a href=\"/wiki/Carbohydrate\" title=\"Carbohydrate\">carbohydrates</a> in a meal.

Rye bread was still baked at <a href=\"/wiki/Farm\" title=\"Farm\">farms</a> well into the 19th century, as most people lived in the countryside. The loaves were <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/oblong\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikt:oblong\">oblong</a> in shape, made from ground whole rye, leavened with <a href=\"/wiki/Sour_dough\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sour dough\">sour dough</a> and sometimes sweetened with <a href=\"/wiki/Malt_syrup\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Malt syrup\">malt syrup</a>. The loaves weighed up to 15\u201316&#160;kg. They were baked once a month, as heating the oven was both time-consuming and used a lot of <a href=\"/wiki/Firewood\" title=\"Firewood\">firewood</a>. The <a href=\"/wiki/Baker\" title=\"Baker\">bakers</a> in the towns baked their rye bread for the day.\n</p><p>We only know little about the other types of bread in the olden times. More refined bread types for special occasions and feasts were prepared from <a href=\"/wiki/Sieve\" title=\"Sieve\">sifted</a> rye flour, and loaves made from wheat must have been eaten. Around 1400, the emblem of the bakers\u2019 <a href=\"/wiki/Guild\" title=\"Guild\">guild</a> became the triangular <i>skonrogge</i> (i.e. a small leavened rye bread that is cleaved and baked again until dry, also Danish besk\u00f8jt, French biscuit, Latin bis-coctus: baked twice). Around 1600, the skonrogge was replaced as the baker\u2019s emblem by the <a href=\"/wiki/Pretzel\" title=\"Pretzel\">pretzel</a>-shaped <i><a href=\"/wiki/Kringle\" title=\"Kringle\">kringle</a></i>, which is still the emblem of the bakers\u2019 guild today. We find the first systematic description of Danish bread in 1821 in Charles Adolph D\u00e9nys Mourier\u2019s book on bread and bread-making. He describes various leavened bread types: <i>rugbr\u00f8d</i> (whole rye bread), <i>franskbr\u00f8d</i> (white wheat bread), <i>sigtebr\u00f8d</i> (sifted rye bread) and <i>tvebakker</i> (wheat <a href=\"/wiki/Biscuits\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Biscuits\">biscuits</a>), as well as unleavened bread types: <i>fladbr\u00f8d</i> (wheat, rye, oats, bran in various combinations) and <a href=\"/wiki/Wafer\" title=\"Wafer\">wafers</a>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Today\">Today</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Nordic_bread_culture&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Today\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In the late 19th century, Danish bakers in the larger towns created the idea of freshly baked bread in the morning (morgenbr\u00f8d) in various shapes and with a variety of seasonings, baked from wheat intended for the rising <a href=\"/wiki/Bourgeoisie\" title=\"Bourgeoisie\">bourgeoisie</a>. Since then, freshly baked bread has been produced in every Danish baker\u2019s shop together with all the other kinds of bread. This decentralised form of baking bread alongside the industrialised production of bread seems to be characteristic of the Danish bread sector. The quality of Danish bread declined in the latter part of the 20th century, but it has dramatically recovered during the past 20 years due to many factors: a growing interest in bread, criticism from <a href=\"/wiki/Gastronome\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Gastronome\">gastronomes</a>, the marketing of better quality flour, better baking <a href=\"/wiki/Entrepreneurship\" title=\"Entrepreneurship\">entrepreneurship</a>, top restaurants baking their own bread and, last but not least, inspiration from <a href=\"/wiki/Immigrant\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Immigrant\">immigrants</a>.

When grain was scarce, people used many different types of <a href=\"/wiki/Tree_bark\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Tree bark\">tree bark</a> such as <a href=\"/wiki/Birch\" title=\"Birch\">birch</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Pine\" title=\"Pine\">pine</a> as a substitute to make <a href=\"/wiki/Bark_bread\" title=\"Bark bread\">bark bread</a>. Around the 10th century, wheat became a more commonly used cultivated grain, but it did not overtake rye or oats. In the Early Middle Ages, the most commonly used cultivation technique was three-shift cultivation. This type of cultivation method involved using one third of the field for autumn grain (especially rye), one third for spring grain and the rest for <a href=\"/wiki/Fallow\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Fallow\">fallow</a>. This approach enabled good harvests and provided good <a href=\"/wiki/Pasture\" title=\"Pasture\">pasture</a> for cattle. The method also guaranteed crucial grain supplies for <a href=\"/wiki/Bread_flour\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Bread flour\">bread flour</a>.\n</p><p>Finland\u2019s cultural position between East and West has also left its mark on bread-making. Western Finland was influenced by baking and cultivation techniques from Scandinavia, whereas eastern Finland was exposed to Russian influences. \n</p><p>In North <a href=\"/wiki/Karelia\" title=\"Karelia\">Karelia</a>, in eastern Finland, households baked their bread in large ovens several times a week and the bread was eaten fresh. Bread was made from rye and dough heart (sourdough starter) could be hundreds of years\u2019 old, bread raised without added <a href=\"/wiki/Yeast\" title=\"Yeast\">yeast</a>.\n</p><p>In western Finland, it was not as common for bread to be baked weekly. Baking happened probably once or twice a month using barley and oats. Added yeast was used in the dough. Before baking, a small hole was made in the corner of the round, flattened bread, and after baking the bread was hung on poles suspended just below the kitchen ceiling to dry and for storage: see <a href=\"/wiki/Ruisreik%C3%A4leip%C3%A4\" title=\"Ruisreik\u00e4leip\u00e4\">ruisreik\u00e4leip\u00e4</a>. Barley, and sometimes wheat, was used in the western part of Finland. The most frequently cultivated grain was rye, followed by barley. \n</p><p>Bread culture in <a href=\"/wiki/Central_Finland\" title=\"Central Finland\">central Finland</a> was influenced by both the <a href=\"/wiki/Eastern_Finland_Province\" title=\"Eastern Finland Province\">East</a> and the <a href=\"/wiki/Western_Finland_Province\" title=\"Western Finland Province\">West</a>. Bread was also influenced to some extent by <a href=\"/wiki/Lapland_(Finland)\" title=\"Lapland (Finland)\">Lapland</a>; bread was called \u201crieska\u201d, but it was much thicker than Lappish rieska.

Poor households baked their own bread daily in small apartments. The bread consisted of thinner, <a href=\"/wiki/Multigrain_bread\" title=\"Multigrain bread\">multigrain breads</a>, elongated <i>sekaleip\u00e4</i> mixed-cereal bread. Bread was made from all four of the cereals grown in Finland: wheat, rye, barley and oats, usually ground into various grades. Rye bread can be either light or dark in colour, depending on the type of flour mixture used, and it is typical for rye bread to include about 20% wheat flour. New trends and old traditions are bringing old-fashioned rye breads back to the shelves in shops. These rye breads are made entirely from rye flour and are the most common breads in the Finnish diet. Other types of sour bread are still baked in the residual heat of ovens and the longer baking time at low temperature gives the bread both a darker colour and a higher density and hardness than ordinary rye bread. A few wheat breads are still made in Finland, although most are simple buns or loaves of sliced or unsliced bread. <i><a href=\"/wiki/Vesirinkeli\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Vesirinkeli\">Vesirinkeli</a></i>, water rings, are small, almost tasteless rings of yeast-leavened wheat bread, which resemble <a href=\"/wiki/Bagels\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Bagels\">bagels</a>. They are cooked in salted boiling water before being baked. Oats are the most commonly produced grain in Finland and many oat bread types are available, although they are not as popular as rye breads. The most common bread types in Finland are bread rolls or buns, \u201cs\u00e4mpyl\u00e4\u201d or flat soft bread pieces.\n</p><p>The potato, although a late introduction to Finland in the early 19th&#160;century, features heavily in food culture and has found its way into many kinds of bread. Dough made with potato is usually very soft and the bread will be moister and fluffier than plain wheat or oat bread. This bread is widely used, particularly in northern Finland and Lapland.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"21st_century_innovations_2\">21st century innovations</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Nordic_bread_culture&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: 21st century innovations\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><b>\u201cRuisnappi\u201c</b> \u2013 In <a href=\"/wiki/Tampere\" title=\"Tampere\">Tampere</a>, central Finland, a large bakery has invented a rye snack, flavoured with <a href=\"/wiki/Chili_pepper\" title=\"Chili pepper\">chilli</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Lemon\" title=\"Lemon\">lemon</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Onion\" title=\"Onion\">onion</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Garlic\" title=\"Garlic\">garlic</a>.

In <a href=\"/wiki/Mediaeval\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Mediaeval\">Mediaeval</a> times, wheat was to some extent imported. However, it was mostly used for bread for <a href=\"/wiki/Tribal_chief\" title=\"Tribal chief\">chiefs</a> and for <a href=\"/wiki/Oblate\" title=\"Oblate\">oblates</a>. Grain cultivation is thought to have been abandoned before 1600 due to harsher climatic conditions, and subsequently most grains such as barley and rye were imported. Until the late 19th century, wheat was mostly bought by richer people. In the 17th century, rye and barley were the most common grains, with rye becoming more prominent in the 18th and 19th centuries.\n</p><p>The issue of a lack of grain was overcome in different ways in different parts of the country. In some areas, grain was made to go further using <a href=\"/wiki/Dulse\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Dulse\">Dulse</a> (<i><a href=\"/wiki/Palmaria_palmata\" title=\"Palmaria palmata\">Palmaria palmata</a></i>; <a href=\"/wiki/Icelandic_language\" title=\"Icelandic language\">Icelandic</a>: <i><span lang=\"is\">s\u00f6l</span></i>), Iceland Moss (<i><a href=\"/wiki/Cetraria_islandica\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cetraria islandica\">Cetraria islandica</a></i>; IS: fjallagr\u00f6s) or Irish Moss (<i><a href=\"/wiki/Chondrus_crispus\" title=\"Chondrus crispus\">Chondrus crispus</a></i>; <a href=\"/wiki/Icelandic_language\" title=\"Icelandic language\">Icelandic</a>: <i><span lang=\"is\">fj\u00f6rugr\u00f6s</span></i>) in <a href=\"/wiki/Compotes\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Compotes\">compotes</a> and breads, or by flattening the dough so thin that the bread became almost transparent.

Dulse breads and biscuits can be made by mixing Dulse, rye, and Icelandic Moss in equal proportions.\n</p><p>Only in the last few decades has grain (barley) been cultivated. It is still cultivated on a very small scale, mostly for <a href=\"/wiki/Animal_feed\" title=\"Animal feed\">feed</a>. Other grains, such as varieties of rye and wheat, have been cultivated, although this is still very much at an experimental stage.\n</p><p>It was not until the 18th century that it became common practice to make leavened rye breads. <a href=\"/wiki/Sour_dough\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sour dough\">Sour dough</a> was mostly used (older rye dough which had started to <a href=\"/wiki/Ferment\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Ferment\">ferment</a>). These breads were called pottbrau\u00f0 (pot breads) because they were baked (or rather steamed) on a stove under a pot (upside down) \u2013 i.e. a kind of oven. Around 1900, it was common to bake these breads in sealed containers (i.e. from imported <a href=\"/wiki/Sweets\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sweets\">sweets</a>, today often from milk cartons). When ovens became a household item, the containers were placed in them. Where <a href=\"/wiki/Thermal_spring\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Thermal spring\">thermal springs</a> were available nearby, they were (and still are) used to bake these dark, moist and rather sweet breads (taking up to 24 hours). Rye breads baked in hot springs are a popular item today, being served for local consumption as well as for tourists.\n</p><p>In general, stock fish (<a href=\"/wiki/Icelandic_language\" title=\"Icelandic language\">Icelandic</a>: <i><span lang=\"is\"><a href=\"/wiki/Har%C3%B0fiskur\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Har\u00f0fiskur\">har\u00f0fiskur</a></span></i>) was served as a bread substitute, eaten with butter on the side with almost every meal. Today, stock fish has lost its role as a bread substitute. It is however still eaten in the same way, either with or without butter.

However, these breads where mostly consumed by chiefs/richer people until the 20th century.

Everyday bread is mostly made by industrial bakeries or bought at the local bakery. However, baking at home is still a common practice amongst young and older households alike, especially in connection with having guests and celebrations. Both traditional recipes and modern/new recipes are popular, with new methods replacing older ones to some extent.

Sometimes wheat was added as well. The bread was <a href=\"/wiki/Kneading\" title=\"Kneading\">kneaded</a> and flattened into a round form by a cake roller or by hand, picked and baked on a hot stove or in ashes. Before the Second World War, flatbrau\u00f0 was only served with a meal. However, since then it has become a popular feature on the coffee table. Today, flatbrau\u00f0 with <a href=\"/wiki/Hangikj%C3%B6t\" title=\"Hangikj\u00f6t\">hangikj\u00f6t</a> (<a href=\"/wiki/Smoked_food\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Smoked food\">smoked</a>, cooked <a href=\"/wiki/Sheep\" title=\"Sheep\">lamb</a>, in thin slices) is often served, both in restaurants and at home.\n</p><p>Several types of <a href=\"/wiki/Fried_bread\" title=\"Fried bread\">fried bread</a> can be categorised as traditional; laufabrau\u00f0 (leaf bread), <a href=\"/wiki/Kleinur\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Kleinur\">kleinur</a> (bows), <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Lummur&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Lummur (page does not exist)\">lummur</a> (small pancakes), p\u00f6nnuk\u00f6kur (<a href=\"/wiki/Cr%C3%AApes\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cr\u00eapes\">cr\u00eapes</a>). With the exception of laufabrau\u00f0, none of these is mentioned in written records until the late 18th century. Laufabrau\u00f0 is sometimes called \u201csnowflake bread\u201d in English because of its intricate cut-out pattern. Through the centuries, it was probably only served to chiefs, made from wheat and sugar and fried with butter. By the 19th century, it had become a festival bread for public consumption. At the time, it was made from cheaper ingredients, barley and rye meal, and fried in sheep fat (t\u00f3lg). In the late 19th century, laufabrau\u00f0 was a festival bread in the north and northeast, mostly at Christmas. Since then, the tradition has spread across the whole country. Making this crispy bread is still a popular family event today and for many an essential part of the Christmas preparations. Dozens of family members or friends will often spend an entire December afternoon kneading, rolling, decorating and frying the bread, which is then kept until Christmas Eve or Christmas Day, when it is eaten with smoked lamb.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"21st_century_innovations_3\">21st century innovations</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Nordic_bread_culture&amp;action=edit&amp;section=13\" title=\"Edit section: 21st century innovations\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><b>\u201cM\u00fdbiti\u201d (Midge bite)</b> \u2013 Students from The Icelandic Academy of Arts have developed a local \u201c<a href=\"/wiki/Fastfood\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Fastfood\">fastfood</a>\u201d in cooperation with farmers around <a href=\"/wiki/Lake_M%C3%BDvatn\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Lake M\u00fdvatn\">lake M\u00fdvatn</a> (Midge lake).

Barley is the oldest grain and dominated in the mountainous northern parts of the region, while oats were most common in humid areas. Because of the cold climate, rye and wheat were cultivated only in <a href=\"/wiki/Southern_Norway\" title=\"Southern Norway\">southern Norway</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Import\" title=\"Import\">importing</a> was necessary. Wheat products were very exclusive and primarily enjoyed by the elite on festive occasions. Wheat was also used in the holy bread in churches.\n</p><p>The coarse loafs were simply made from flour or crushed grain that was kneaded with hot water or some other liquid and shaped into a flat cake of dough. These cakes were placed on a flat stone beside the fire, in the ashes or on the embers of the fire. They were used as a bread plate with fish, meats and vegetables. These breads were mainly baked from barley and oats and had in common the fact that they could not be kept for more than a few days. They needed to be preserved. This led to the development of very thin, dry and crispy flatbreads (<a href=\"/wiki/Flatbr%C3%B8d\" title=\"Flatbr\u00f8d\">flatbr\u00f8d</a>) that could be stored for many years.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Lefserull_or_wrap.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Lefserull or wrap.\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Lefserull_or_wrap.jpg/220px-Lefserull_or_wrap.jpg\" width=\"220\" height=\"124\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Lefserull_or_wrap.jpg 1.5x\" data-file-width=\"286\" data-file-height=\"161\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Lefserull_or_wrap.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Lefserull or wrap</div></div></div>\n<p>For festive occasions, especially Christmas, the Norwegians have a long tradition of making various kinds of very thin flatbread called <a href=\"/wiki/Lefse\" title=\"Lefse\">lefser</a>, tunnbr\u00f8d, kling, klining or <a href=\"/wiki/Krotekake\" title=\"Krotekake\">krotekake</a>.

These mills depended on a good flow of water, which mainly occurred during the autumn and spring. These two seasons were the time for baking flatbread and lefser. Once rye began to be cultivated around 1500, the baking techniques changed to leaven breads in ovens, e.g. with sour dough and later with other leavens. The rye in oven-baked bread was often mixed with barley for economy. It was only baked once a month, or more often during the summer. During storage, these breads gradually became drier and drier, even if they were carefully wrapped in cloth or placed in grain bins. However, dry bread was also more economical and eating fresh bread was considered a luxury. A high intake of <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Wholegrain_bread&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Wholegrain bread (page does not exist)\">wholegrain bread</a> has been typical of Norwegian bread eating habits for both breakfast and lunch.\n</p><p>A special preparation was used to make leavened oven baked bread longer-lasting.

These first breads were baked using barley flour, or perhaps wheat for thin or flat bread cakes (<a href=\"/wiki/Tunnbr%C3%B6d\" title=\"Tunnbr\u00f6d\">tunnbr\u00f6d</a>).<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> Bread became an important item in the new Christian religion (AD 900) for celebrating <a href=\"/wiki/Holy_Communion\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Holy Communion\">Holy Communion</a> (bread and wine), which emphasised bread as being both new and important.\n</p><p>Thin bread was baked on stones or iron plates or in a large oven, and this tradition is still in existence today.\n</p><p>In Medieval times (1100\u20131200 AD) in central and southern Sweden, rye flour was baked into soft loafs or, in the central regions, into crispbread (<a href=\"/wiki/Kn%C3%A4ckebr%C3%B6d\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Kn\u00e4ckebr\u00f6d\">kn\u00e4ckebr\u00f6d</a>, \u201cbread which can be broken\u201d). The crispbread was baked with a hole in the middle so that it could be threaded over a beam and stored suspended from the ceiling. From Medieval times and the introduction of the first simple watermills, these flatbreads and crispbreads were baked only once or twice a year and kept dry in a storage chamber.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tleft\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Swedish_knackebrod1_tellstrom.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Contemporary kn\u00e4ckebr\u00f6d with its traditional hole.\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Swedish_knackebrod1_tellstrom.jpg/220px-Swedish_knackebrod1_tellstrom.jpg\" width=\"220\" height=\"165\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/Swedish_knackebrod1_tellstrom.jpg 1.5x\" data-file-width=\"229\" data-file-height=\"172\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Swedish_knackebrod1_tellstrom.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Contemporary kn\u00e4ckebr\u00f6d with its traditional hole.</div></div></div>\n<p>Rye flour was sometimes mixed with <a href=\"/wiki/Pea_flour\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Pea flour\">pea flour</a> or, in times of famine, bark. From the 18th century, it was mixed with grated potatoes to make it last longer. Oatmeal was used in southwestern Sweden to bake thin breads or flatbreads. Sour dough was used as yeast, along with yeast from beer production (from the 19th century).<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> Around 1860\u201370, industrial pressed yeast production started to result in more voluminous bread.\n</p><p>In southern Sweden, rye bread was more often baked into softer and thick bread cakes (<a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Kavring&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Kavring (page does not exist)\">kavring</a>, \u201cround bread\u201d), and from the 19th century flavoured with syrup or <a href=\"/wiki/Molasses\" title=\"Molasses\">molasses</a>. Professional male bakers started to sell bread in the cities during the 13th century. However, in the countryside, everyday bread was baked at home by the women. Swedish recipe books dating from the 17th\u201318th century contain recipes of cakes, but not everyday bread, indicating that cakes were baked less often and amongst the higher echelons of society. The process of how to make everyday bread was kept among women as <a href=\"/wiki/Tacit_knowledge\" title=\"Tacit knowledge\">tacit knowledge</a>.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Nordic_bread_mapp_tellstrom.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Nordic_bread_mapp_tellstrom.jpg/220px-Nordic_bread_mapp_tellstrom.jpg\" width=\"220\" height=\"307\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/Nordic_bread_mapp_tellstrom.jpg 1.5x\" data-file-width=\"295\" data-file-height=\"412\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Nordic_bread_mapp_tellstrom.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Bread types in Sweden around the 1880s.

Quite unlike other types of bread in the surrounding northern region, rieska is a type of bread that does not keep, which is why it is baked daily or weekly. The S\u00e0mi people have also baked soft bread on stones on a more daily basis. The large Finnish minority group in Sweden has eaten a stiffer rye bread baked with sour dough.\n</p><p>Bread was historically served in one of two ways, either broken into pieces in a <a href=\"/wiki/Soup\" title=\"Soup\">soup</a> or dipped in a hot drink, or served in the form of butter spread on a slice of bread and served as an open sandwich.<sup id=\"cite_ref-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup> In regions where they lacked cereals or bread, <a href=\"/wiki/Dried_fish\" title=\"Dried fish\">dried fish</a> has functioned as bread. In order to make it edible, the fish was first beaten with a stone until it became soft. The fish was spread with butter and eaten like a sandwich. Potato came to replace bread as a staple food during the 19th century and bread retained its position as the main component of breakfast, but it became a side-dish to hot luncheons and dinners when potato took over the former central role of bread.<sup id=\"cite_ref-14\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Figure to the right shows the bread regions that existed around 1880, according to \u00c5ke Campbell (1950), before industrialisation led to all types of bread becoming available nationwide. Throughout history, the cities have always had a wider variety of bread types, as well as more expensive and higher status bread products in the form of cakes baked with sugar, butter and <a href=\"/wiki/Oriental\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Oriental\">oriental</a> spices. The boundaries should not be interpreted as being definitive, as cultural ideals always tend to vary along a boundary.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Today_5\">Today</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Nordic_bread_culture&amp;action=edit&amp;section=20\" title=\"Edit section: Today\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>During the switch to a modern urban and industrialised society, bread types changed when large industrial bakeries introduced new soft bread, which from the early 1920s was often sweetened (s\u00f6tlimpa, sweet thick bread). From then on, bread was bought from stores and bakeries, rather than baked at home, as had previously been the case. Regional variations decreased due to the transportation and marketing of bread as a national product. The consumption of bread products of various kinds has increased since the 1990s and wholegrain bread and wheat bread are the most popular. All older bread types still exist alongside the new ones, indicating the much greater variety open to individuals today than has been the case in the past. Soft bread consumption has increased by more than 60% since the 1990s, from 30&#160;kg to 50&#160;kg per person and year today (2007). The older types of bread are still eaten in Sweden, but today they are usually professionally baked. New international types such as <a href=\"/wiki/Naan\" title=\"Naan\">naan</a> bread, ciabatta, <a href=\"/wiki/Focaccia\" title=\"Focaccia\">focaccia</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Pita\" title=\"Pita\">pita</a> and bagels have been popular since the 1990s. 20% of Swedes are first- or second-generation immigrants and use bread both as they did in their home countries and as it is used today in contemporary Swedish normative food culture.<sup id=\"cite_ref-15\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"21st_century_innovations_5\">21st century innovations</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Nordic_bread_culture&amp;action=edit&amp;section=21\" title=\"Edit section: 21st century innovations\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><b>Bread Ice Cream</b> \u2013 In <a href=\"/wiki/Grythyttan\" title=\"Grythyttan\">Grythyttan</a> in central Sweden, the local ice cream and chocolate shop has invented a new ice cream. They have taken an ordinary white vanilla ice cream and flavoured it with dry crispbread of rye (<a href=\"/wiki/Kn%C3%A4ckebr%C3%B6d\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Kn\u00e4ckebr\u00f6d\">kn\u00e4ckebr\u00f6d</a>). Small pieces of the bread are also added to the ice cream, giving it the texture of both smooth ice cream and hard and sometime soggy bites of the crispbread. The ice cream is very popular among young people.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Similarities_and_diversities_in_Nordic_breads\">Similarities and diversities in Nordic breads</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Nordic_bread_culture&amp;action=edit&amp;section=22\" title=\"Edit section: Similarities and diversities in Nordic breads\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Nordic food culture in the south and east of the region comprises a tradition of baking softer rye breads. In Denmark and especially in Sweden, the soft rye bread is sweeter; in Finland, a drier sour rye bread type is traditional. Iceland has for the past hundred years imported grain to make bread, as grain is not cultivated on the island. Due to the lack of grain, local ingredients such as Dulse or Iceland Moss were sometimes used to partly replace the grain. Soft sweet rye bread has also been baked for centuries in Iceland (i.e. the rye bread baked in hot springs) \u2013 the difference is that the rye has been imported from the other Nordic countries. People in the northern regions of Norway, Sweden and Finland have a tradition of baking thin flat, crispy breads using barley. Since Medieval times, bread was only baked once or twice a year and stored in dry chambers. In central Sweden and central Finland, there is a belt where a tradition of baking thin rye bread has developed. A paradox is that amongst people in the northern sub-alpine regions of Norway, Sweden and Finland and amongst the S\u00e1mi people, bread has been baked on a weekly basis and eaten as soft bread cakes. In all Nordic countries, dried fish has been used as a bread substitute, being served buttered. Today, international bread types are mixed with the old ones, and bread is used both in food innovations such as yoghurt with bread and fastfood bread and in new meal settings.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Nordic_bread_culture&amp;action=edit&amp;section=23\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist columns references-column-width\" style=\"-moz-column-width: 30em; -webkit-column-width: 30em; column-width: 30em; list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Gastronomisk Leksikon, udgivet af Det Danske Gastronomiske Akademi, Gyldendal 1998, revidert udgave udkommer maj 2010.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-2\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Kolmonen, J.
