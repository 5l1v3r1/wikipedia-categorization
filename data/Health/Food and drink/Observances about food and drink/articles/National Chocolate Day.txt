There are a variety of dates that have been designated as "Chocolate Day" around the world. The most commonly accepted such date is July 7.  Various Chocolate Days have been called Local, National or International/World, including conflicting claims.  The U.S. National Confectioners Association lists four primary chocolate holidays on their calendar [improper synthesis?] (Chocolate Day (July 7), two National Chocolate Days (October 28 and December 28), and International Chocolate Day (September 13) ), in addition to variants such as National Milk Chocolate Day, National White Chocolate Day, and National Cocoa Day. International Chocolate Day coincides with the birth date of Milton S. Hershey (September 13, 1857),    founder of The Hershey Chocolate Company.
