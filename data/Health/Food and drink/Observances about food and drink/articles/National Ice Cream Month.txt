National Ice Cream Month is celebrated each year in July and National Ice Cream Day is celebrated on the third Sunday in July, in the United States. The celebrations were originated by Joint resolution 298, which was sponsored by Senator Walter Dee Huddleston of Kentucky on May 17, 1984.  The resolution proclaimed the month of July 1984 as "National Ice Cream Month" and July 15, 1984, as "National Ice Cream Day". It was signed into public law  by President Ronald Reagan on July 9, 1984 with Presidential Proclamation 5219.  Even though the resolution only mentioned a specific month and day in 1984, the celebrations have held up in the years ever since, publicized by ice cream manufacturers.
