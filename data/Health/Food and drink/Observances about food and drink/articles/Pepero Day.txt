Pepero Day is an observance in South Korea similar to Valentine's Day, but held on November 11. The current purpose of this day is to give Pepero snacks, a line of chocolate-dipped cookie sticks, to show affection for friends and loved ones. The exact origins of this day are unknown.  The origins are usually traced to a news story set in 1983. In the story, two female middle school students in the Yeongnam region exchanged Pepero wishing that they would both become tall and thin.  However, there is some doubt about this story.  Some argue that the origin was due to the shape of 1’s in the date (November 11 – 11/11) resembling Pepero sticks,  while some others attribute the similarity of shapes as factors that attributed to the popularity but not its origin.   The fad spread with the idea that, for maximum effectiveness for height and thinness, one must eat 11 packets of Pepero on November 11, 11:11am and 11:11pm  at 11 seconds exactly. From 1997, Lotte started to use the aforementioned school story to successfully promote Pepero Day. The trend led to other companies creating similarly shaped snacks to participate on Pepero Day.  As of  2012[update], Lotte was making 50% of its annual sales on Pepero Day.  As of  2013[update], several department stores including Hyundai Department Store, Shinsegae, and Lotte Department Store were benefiting for people celebrating the day while stores such as E-mart and Homeplus were specially displaying and selling peperos on the day.  Pepero Day has been criticized for being a business tool of certain companies and for having high calories which is contradictory to its original meaning. Alternatives include "Garaetteok Day", which promotes Farmer’s Day through exchanges of garaetteok (sticks of white tteok).
