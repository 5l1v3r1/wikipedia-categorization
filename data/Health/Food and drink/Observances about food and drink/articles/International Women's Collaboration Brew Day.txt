International Women's Collaboration Brew Day (IWCBD) is an annual event held on 8th March, to coincide with International Women's Day. The event was first started in 2014, when 60 women brewmasters around the world simultaneously brewed the same recipe of craft beer.  The event helps to raise awareness of women working in the brewing industry, especially as brewmasters. It is also a chance for women interested in brewing to network with one another.  The idea for the IWCBD came from Project Venus member, Sophie de Ronde, who reached out to the Pink Boots Society in 2013 to start a "unified brew day."  De Ronde wanted the day "to encourage women to brew together."  The day was meant to coincide with International Women's Day and would "raise awareness of women in the brewing industry and raise money for local charities and Pink Boots Society."  Brewing beer has become a male-dominated industry and is "still struggling with sexism and gender bias."  Another participant said, "I'd like to normalize the idea that women can and do work in the brewhouse along with other departments in a brewery."  The first year, 2014, over 60 women in five different countries brewed a pale ale called Unite.  In 2015, there were 80 women from eleven different countries involved who worked together to brew Unite red ale.   In South Africa, Apiwe Nxusani-Mawela, helped organize the first IWCBD event in Johannesburg.  For 2016, the type of beer brewed was a gose.
