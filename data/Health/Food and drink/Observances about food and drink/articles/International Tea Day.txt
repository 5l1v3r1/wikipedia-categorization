International Tea Day is observed annually on December 15. It has been celebrated since 2005 in tea producing countries like Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Vietnam, Indonesia, Kenya, Malawi, Malaysia, Uganda, India and Tanzania.  International Tea Day aims to draw global attention of governments and citizens to the impact of the global tea trade on workers and growers, and has been linked to requests for price supports and fair trade.   After initial discussions at the World Social Forum in 2004, the first International Tea Day was celebrated in New Delhi in 2005,  with later celebrations organized in Sri Lanka in 2006 and 2008.  International Tea Day celebrations and the related Global Tea Conferences have been jointly organized by trade union movements.  In 2015, the Indian government proposed expanding the observance of International Tea Day through the UN Food and Agriculture Organization.
