World Whisky Day was founded in 2012 and falls on the third Saturday of May each year.  World Whisky Day was founded in 2012 by Blair Bowman while studying at the University of Aberdeen.    It is now owned by White Light Media, Edinburgh and in 2017 employed two official whisky ambassadors - Aly Mathers and Joe Kent - who will be championing all things whisky in the run up to #WorldWhiskyDay on 20 May. They be appear in videos, present talks and host tastings, sharing their passion for whisky across the globe. Participants are encouraged to drink whisky on the day at events which may be officially registered on the World Whisky Day website. Others participate via social media using the #worldwhiskyday hashtag.  The organisers estimate that approximately 250,000 people participated in registered events during the 2014 World Whisky Day.  In 2015, World Whisky Day events were registered on all seven continents.  World Whisky Day's assets were sold in February 2015 to the drinks magazine, Hot Rum Cow.   The day was recognised by Members of the Scottish Parliament in a motion in May 2014  and again in 2015.  A World Whisky Day blend was produced in 2012, 2013 and 2014 by Master of Malt.  The day publicly supports the charitable organization Just a Drop.
