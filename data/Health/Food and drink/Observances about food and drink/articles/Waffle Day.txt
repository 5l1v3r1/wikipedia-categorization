Waffle Day is a tradition that is celebrated in Sweden, and to a lesser extent elsewhere, on March 25.  Waffles are typically eaten on this day. The name comes from Vårfrudagen ("Our Lady's Day"), which in vernacular Swedish sounds almost like Våffeldagen (waffle day). Our Lady's Day is celebrated on March 25 (nine months before Christmas), the Christian holiday of Annunciation, and the Waffle Day is hence celebrated on the same day although it has no religious connections to Our Lady's Day. In Sweden the heart shaped waffle iron  is the most common, but didn't come into existence until the 19th century.  Since the 17th century Swedes were creating waffles over a fire with a waffle iron. In the India, National Waffle Day is celebrated July 19. In the United States, National Waffle Day is celebrated August 24, the date of a U.S. patent on a waffle iron.
