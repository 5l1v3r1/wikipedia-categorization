Aajonus Vonderplanitz (born John Richard Swigart  on April 17, 1947 in Denver, Colorado and died 28 August 2013) was an American nutritionist and activist, based in Malibu, California, and in Thailand, who developed the Primal Diet.  Vonderplanitz claimed that in his 20s, he was diagnosed with multiple, terminal cancers resistant to conventional treatments but reversed through raw diets, especially once he included raw meat. Increasingly popular,  the Primal Diet is principally raw meat, raw eggs, raw dairy, raw bland fruit, raw coconut cream, and unheated honey.    He was author of two books: We Want To Live (1997/2005) as well as The Recipe for Living Without Disease (2002). Aajonus fell from his second-story balcony at his home in Thailand when it gave way. He suffered a broken spine and internal bleeding and was taken to the hospital where he died.
