 HealthWise Wales is a project surrounding the health of the population of Wales. It is led by Cardiff University and was launched on 29 February 2016.  It hopes to receive over 260,000 participants of the age of sixteen or over.  The project is the first of its kind in Europe and hopes to "build a picture" of the future health requirements in Wales.
