Life expectancy at birth is 82.3 and infant mortality is 2.7 per 1000 live births. The population is ageing and by 2030, 20% will be over 65.  However it is estimated that about 85% of those over 65 are healthy and reasonably active. There are a variety of health screening and healthy lifestyle  programmes for both adults and children. Only 14% of the population smokes.    The Temasek Cares programme supports a wide range of interventions for disadvantaged people.
