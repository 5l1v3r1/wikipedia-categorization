A Health Equity Impact Analysis is a decision support tool which walks users through the steps of identifying how a program, policy or similar initiative will impact population groups in different ways. HEIAs are meant to show, inter alia, unintended potential impacts. The goal is to maximize positive impacts and reduce negative impacts that could potentially widen health disparities between population groups.
