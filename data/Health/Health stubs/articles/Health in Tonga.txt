Life expectancy in Tonga,  which was once in the mid-70s, has fallen to 64.  Up to 40% of the population is said to have type 2 diabetes.  The people of Tonga are the most obese in the world, with 52.4% of men and 67.2% of women diagnosed as obese. This is thought to be as a result of dietary changes. The consumption of imported meat, particularly mutton flaps, has replaced the islanders' traditional diet of fish, root vegetables and coconuts.  Tāufaʻāhau Tupou IV, who died in 2006, holds the Guinness World Record for being the heaviest-ever monarch - 200kg.
