Leptospirosis is a water contract disease caused by bacteria of the genus Leptospirabacterial. It is a disease that affects both humans and animals. The number of leptospirosis cases had steadily increased from 2011 (2,268 cases with 55 death) to 2015 (8,291 cases with 78 death) and 5,284 cases with 52 death in 2016.  Leptospirosis can have important health impact and is a burden to the nation if not well controlled. Addressing leptospisoris includes maintain a clean environment and by not swimming or wading in water that might be contaminated with animal urine, or eliminating contact with potentially infected animals. The largest contribution to mortality is non communicable disease. 40 million people each year die from noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and accounted for 70% of global deaths annually.  From 1996 to 2011 the proportion of the population who are obese increased from 5% to 15%.  In 2015, National Health Morbidity Survey (NHMS) revealed that the overall prevalence of two out of three major risk factors contributing to non-communicable disease (NCD) remained high for diabetes mellitus and hypercholesterolemia. The prevalence of hypertension has shown a decreased 2.4% in the study done nationwide. The current prevalence (Year 2017) of hypertension in Malaysia is 30.3%, which is lower than the prevalence in 2011 and 2006 with 32.7% and 32.2% respectively.The prevalence of hypercholesterolemia has increased to 47.7% in 2017 from 32.6% in 2011    Risk factors for noncommunicable diseases include tobacco use, reduced physical activity, alcohol abuse and unhealthy food consumption. Risk factors for noncommunicable diseases include tobacco use, reduced physical activity, alcohol abuse and unhealthy food consumption. Managing the risk factor as well as early detection of disease is the key to combat non communicable diseases besides than policy coherence across all levels of government at the national and international level.
