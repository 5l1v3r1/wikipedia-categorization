In Latin America, the Central American countries of Guatemala, and Honduras, and the Caribbean countries of Haiti, and the Dominican Republic have national HIV prevalence of over 1%. In these countries, HIV-infected men outnumber HIV-infected women by roughly 3:1. Low prevalence in other countries disguises serious, localized epidemics. In Mexico, Brazil, Colombia and Argentina, intravenous drug use and homosexual activity are the main modes of transmission, and there is concern that heterosexual activity may soon become a primary method of spreading the virus.
