Gargling (same root as 'gurgle') is the act of bubbling liquid in the mouth. Vibration caused by the muscles in the throat and back of the mouth cause the liquid to bubble and flurry around inside the mouth cavity. A traditional home remedy of gargling warm saltwater is sometimes recommended to soothe a sore throat.   A study in Japan has shown that gargling water a few times a day will lower the chance of upper respiratory infections such as colds, though some medical authorities are skeptical.
