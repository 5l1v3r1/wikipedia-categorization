Distributional cost-effectiveness analysis (DCEA) is an extension of standard cost-effectiveness analysis that incorporates concern for both the average levels of outcomes as well as the distribution of outcomes, particularly useful when evaluating interventions to tackle health inequality.   This includes Extended Cost Effectiveness Analysis which in addition to doing a standard CEA, also assesses the costs and effectiveness for different socioeconomic groups.
