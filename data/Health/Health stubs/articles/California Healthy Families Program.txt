The California Healthy Families Program (HFP) is the California implementation of the federal Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) that provides low cost insurance offering health, dental, and vision coverage to children who do not have insurance today and do not qualify for no-cost Medi-Cal. As a federal program it is administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and as a California program it is administered by the California Managed Risk Medical Insurance Board (MRMIB). As a result of the 2012-2013 budget deal, nearly 900,000 children will be moved from the HFP into Medi-Cal beginning in 2013.
