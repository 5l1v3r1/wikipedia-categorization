Tooth.... regeneration is a stem cell based regenerative medicine procedure in the field of tissue engineering and stem cell biology to replace damaged or lost teeth by regrowing them from autologous stem cells.  As a source of the new bioengineered teeth somatic stem cells are collected and reprogrammed to induced pluripotent stem cells which can be placed in the dental lamina directly or placed in a reabsorbable biopolymer  in the shape of the new tooth   Young et al.  first demonstrated in 2002 that teeth could be regenerated from cells.
