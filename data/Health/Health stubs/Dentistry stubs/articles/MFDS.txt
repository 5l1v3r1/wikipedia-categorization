Redirect to:MFDS is  the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, a government department in South Korea. This is former KFDA, Korean Food and Drug Administration. MFDS is an examination offered by the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh and the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow. It stands for Membership of the Faculty of Dental Surgery. The exam is one of the recognised gateways to further specialist training for dentists in the UK and some Commonwealth countries. If a dentist has this exam it indicates that he or she has undertaken additional study over and above qualifying level. In order to be eligible to sit the MFDS exam a dentist must also have worked in both general dental practice AND a hospital (usually maxillofacial surgery) or community dental post.  The Royal College of Surgeons of England ceased offering the MFDS in 2008; amalgamating the MFDS with the MFGDP exam in order to create a single examination: the MJDF. The MJDF examines dentists on the skills and knowledge required in general practice while also providing a qualification route to specialist training.
