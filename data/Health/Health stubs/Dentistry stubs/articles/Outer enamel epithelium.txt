The outer enamel epithelium, also known as the external enamel epithelium, is a layer of cuboidal cells located on the periphery of the enamel organ in a developing tooth.  This layer is first seen during the bell stage. The rim of the enamel organ where the outer and inner enamel epithelium join is called the cervical loop.
