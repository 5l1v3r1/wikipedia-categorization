Eastmaninstitutet (The Eastman Institute) is a dental care centre specialized in orthodontics, periodontology and oral surgery located in Vasastaden, Stockholm, Sweden.  It was built by donations from the American inventor George Eastman and opened in 1937. The institute provided free dental care for children in Stockholm. For some years the Eastman Institute was unique, but later social democratic reforms made dental care free for all children in Sweden.   Eastmaninstitutet is used as location in the 1976 action film The Man on the Roof. Coordinates: 59°20′25″N 18°02′46″E﻿ / ﻿59.34028°N 18.04611°E﻿ / 59.34028; 18.04611
