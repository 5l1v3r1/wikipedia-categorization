The linea alba (Latin for white line), in dentistry,  is a horizontal streak on the inner surface of the cheek, level with the biting plane. It usually extends from the commissure to the posterior teeth and can extend to the inner lip mucosa and corners of the mouth. It is a common finding and most likely associated with pressure, frictional irritation, or sucking trauma from the facial surfaces of the teeth. It may be found in individuals who chew tobacco, and may be mistaken for a lesion requiring treatment. Treatment is not required.
