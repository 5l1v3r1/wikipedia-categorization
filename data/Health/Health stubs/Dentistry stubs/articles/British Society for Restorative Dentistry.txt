The British Society for Restorative Dentistry was founded in 1968 and promotes standards in the dental profession through conferences, meetings and scientific literature. The society provides a forum for members to debate current issues in Restorative Dentistry and especially in Prosthodontics.   The conference calendar includes two scientific meetings a year (Spring and Autumn) and the once three- yearly Dental Pan Society meeting. The society is affiliated to the European Journal of Prosthodontics and Restorative Dentistry, and has also published policy documents on ‘Guidelines for Crown and Bridge’ and ‘A Strategy for Planning Restorative Care’.
