Gum depigmentation, also known as gum bleaching, is a procedure used in cosmetic dentistry to lighten or remove black spots or patches on the gums caused by melanin. Discolouration may also be caused by long-term use of certain medications. The procedure itself can involve surgical, or laser ablation techniques.  Melanocytes are cells which reside in the basal layer of the gingival epithelium. These cells produce melanin, which are pigments that cause discoloration or dark spots in gums. A dental laser can target and ablate the melanocytes, thus reducing the production of melanin in the gingival tissue.  Following laser depigmentation, the gingiva heals by secondary intention. This results in a lighter and more uniform color of the gums. A study found that (Er,Cr:YSGG) laser was effective and there were no signs of re-pigmentation after a 6 month follow up period.
