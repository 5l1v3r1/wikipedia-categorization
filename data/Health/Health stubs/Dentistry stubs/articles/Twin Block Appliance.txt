A twin block is an orthodontic appliance.  whose purpose is to lengthen the lower jaw by posturing it forward. If the jaw is growing during treatment, it naturally grows at a faster rate; otherwise the appliance is useless. Treatment time varies, but is generally around 9 months. Twin Blocks can also be used to cure an overbite, which can mean treatment may be slightly longer. If this is the case, treatment can vary from 6 to 11 months.
