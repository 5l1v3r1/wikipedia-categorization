Cavitations are an area of dead bone caused by a dearth of blood flow to that part of the bone.  A cavitation is a hole in the blood vessel that cannot be visually detected with the naked eye.  Jawbone cavitations, also called neuralgia-inducing cavitational osteonecrosis (NICO) if they are associated with pain, are extraction sites in the jaw that have not healed.
