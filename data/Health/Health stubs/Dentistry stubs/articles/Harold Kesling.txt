Harold Dean Kesling (April 8, 1901 – 1979) was an American Orthodontist who is known for developing the tooth positioning appliance called "Positioner". This appliance is used in Orthodontics at the end of treatment to allow teeth to settle in occlusion.  In addition, Kesling was a founding member of the Orthodontic company TP Orthodontics in 1959. In 1945, H.D. Kesling stated that “Major tooth movements could be accomplished with a series of Positioners by changing the teeth on the setup slightly as treatment progresses. At present, this type of treatment does not seem to be practical. It still remains a possibility, however, and the technique for its practical application might be developed in the future.” Because of this statement, and his development of the Tooth Positioner appliance, H.D. Kesling is regarded as the forefather of modern aligner treatment (Cite journal www.ajodo.org/article/0096-6347(45)90101-3/abstract).  He was born in Cass County, Indiana in 1901. He graduated from Loyola University Chicago in 1923 with his dental degree. He then opened his private practice in La Porte, Indiana . In 1929, he opened his Orthodontics practice in Hammond, Indiana after receiving his orthodontic degree from Loyola University. Kesling's son, Peter Kesling, developed the Tip Edge Appliance. Kesling is known for developing the Positioner Appliance.  He developed this appliance during his work in the La Porte office in Indiana. His developed technique attracted many other orthodontists to his practice and Kesling gave many seminars in 1950s regarding this appliance.  Kesling was influenced by the work of Raymond Begg and his light wire technique. He switched his treatment to the Begg Technique after he traveled to Australia and learned about the technique. For next 40 years, Kesling would go on to use this method  in his practice. Kesling eventually gave seminars and lectures on Begg technique. 4. www.ajodo.org/article/0096-6347(45)90101-3/abstract 5.https://10-aso.cdn.aspedia.net/sites/default/files/uploaded-content/field_f_content_file/brighter_futures_-_moving_teeth_sequential_plastic_aligners1.pdf
