Eleazer Parmly (March 13, 1797 â€“ December 13, 1874) was an American dentist in New York City during the early 1800s. He was the first Provost of The University of Maryland School of Dentistry, a first dental school established in the United States. He was the third of five brothers and his three brothers also pursued careers in dentistry. Parmly was born in 1797, in Braintree, Vermont. At the age of 23, Parmly moved to London to work as a dentist. In 1823, he moved back to the United States to practice in New York City, where he opened a dental shop on Bond Street.   He was responsible for the development of American dentistry from a primitive craft to a respected profession with various national societies and journals. He also furthered the development of dental colleges. In addition to being a well-trained practitioner and educator, Parmly was a gifted poet and set down his autobiography in verse.  He worked with several other famous dentists of the time, such as Solyman Brown, Norman William Kingsley, and Chapin A. Harris. Parmly died of pneumonia on December 13, 1874, in New York City, at the age of 77.
