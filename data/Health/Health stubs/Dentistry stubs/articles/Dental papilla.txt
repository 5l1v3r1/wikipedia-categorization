In embryology and prenatal development, the dental papilla is a condensation of ectomesenchymal cells called odontoblasts, seen in histologic sections of a developing tooth.  It lies below a cellular aggregation known as the enamel organ. The dental papilla appears after 8â€“10 weeks intra uteral life. The dental papilla gives rise to the dentin and pulp of a tooth. The enamel organ, dental papilla, and dental follicle together forms one unit, called the tooth germ.  This is of importance because all the tissues of a tooth and its supporting structures form from these distinct cellular aggregations.
