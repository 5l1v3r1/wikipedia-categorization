A mamelon (from French mamelon, "nipple"), is one of three rounded protuberances which are present on the cutting edge of an incisor tooth when it first erupts through the gum. Mamelons are quickly worn away by use.  Mamelons are easiest to observe on the Maxillary central incisors, and appear as three small prominences on the incisal edge of the tooth. Mamelons are ordinarily of no clinical importance. Usually they are worn off early in the life of the tooth. However, when an anterior open bite is present — that is, the anterior teeth are not in contact when the bite is fully closed — mamelons may remain into adulthood.
