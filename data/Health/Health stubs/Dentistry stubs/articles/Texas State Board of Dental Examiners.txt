The Texas State Board of Dental Examiners (SBDE) is a state agency of Texas. It has its headquarters in Suite 800 of Tower 3 of the William P. Hobby State Office Building in Downtown Austin, Texas.  The board regulates dental clinics in the state. The agency includes an executive division with five employees, an administration, finance, and personnel division with two employees, a licensing division with six employees, an enforcement division with fourteen employees, and a legal division with seven employees.  The dental board itself has 15 board members.  Dr. Christine Ellis, an orthodontist in the North Texas region who served as one of the auditors of All Smiles Dental Centers, said that she complained about All Smiles to the SBDE around 2012 but the board said that it was unable to handle the case.
