Oral galvanism or amalgam disease was a term for the association of oral or systemic symptoms to either: toxic effects of amalgam fillings; or electric currents between metal in dental restorations and electrolytes in saliva or dental pulp.    Any existence of galvanic pain or association of either currents or mercury to presence of symptoms has been disproven.   Beyond acute allergic reaction amalgam has not been found to be associated with any adverse effects.  Very weak currents have been measured in the mouth of those with multiple dental fillings consisting of different alloys, but there was no association between presence of current and symptoms,  and any symptoms associated with currents between oral fillings are likely to be psychosomatic in nature.  No association between presence of mercury and symptoms have been found, with symptoms likely to be psychosomatic in nature and do not improve with chelation therapy.    Claims of causing a variety of symptoms such as oral discomfort, skin irritation, headaches and a metallic taste in the mouth have been discredited.   The condition was originally proposed in 1878,  and became well known in Sweden during the 1970s and 80s, because of a campaign to educate about and replace oral amalgam fillings with mercury with other compounds such as ceramic or polymer restorations.
