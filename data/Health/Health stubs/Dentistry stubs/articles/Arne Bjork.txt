Arne Bjork (1911â€“1996) was a Swedish dentist famous for his The Face in Profile Analysis which he published in 1947. He is also known to develop the implant radiography.  Dr. Bjork was born in Darlane, Sweden. He received his dental training in Stockholm. He practiced dentistry from 1937 to 1951. He served as chairman of orthodontics in Malmo, Sweden from 1940-1950. He then served as Professor of Orthodontics in Royal Dental College, Denmark. Eventually he became the head of Department of Orthodontics and head of Craniofacial Growth Center at the Royal Dental College for next 30 years. He was nominated as member of World Federations of Orthodontists in 1995.  Bjork was one of the first people to work on Implant Radiography. He along with his coworkers, placed metal pins in bones of jaws and other parts of skeleton. They then looked at these pins in a Cephalometric Analysis to assess the growth pattern of a growing individual. This technique was instrumental in providing a way to study the grown pattern of a human mandible. Bjork also developed seven structural signs that helped find the direction of the growth of mandible, also known as Bjork Analysis.
