The median alveolar cyst is a rare cyst, occurring in the bony alveolus between the maxillary central incisors.  It is distinguished from a periapical cyst by the fact that adjacent teeth are vital. Treatment is by enucleation, or surgical removal. Sanjay Saraf (1 December 2008). Textbook of Oral Pathology. Jaypee Brothers Publishers. p. 66. ISBN 978-81-8061-655-6.
