 The Marin Municipal Water District (or MMWD) is the government agency that provides drinking water to southern and central Marin County, California.  Chartered in 1912, it became California's first municipal water district.  It serves 195,000 people in a 147-square-mile (380 km2) area that includes ten towns and cities.  The District's seven reservoirs in Marin County provide about 75% of the water it uses:  As of May 7, 2016, these 7 reservoirs stored 77,605 acre-feet, which is 97.54% of capacity. The average storage for this date is 70,864 acre-feet, or 89.06%.  Over 21,000 acres (8,500 ha) of land in District ownership are open to the public for recreational use from sunrise to sunset. There are 130 miles (210 km) of trails and unpaved roads available for hiking. The Cataract Falls Trail is one of the most popular trails. Many of the trails are also open for dog walking and horseback riding, while bicycling is only allowed on fire roads. Portions of the seven District reservoirs are open for hiking, biking, horseback riding, fishing, and picnicking. Camping, swimming, and boating are prohibited.
