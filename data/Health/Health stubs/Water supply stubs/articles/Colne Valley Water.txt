The Colne Valley Water Company was a statutory water company supplying parts of South West Hertfordshire and parts of Middlesex from 1873 to 1994.    In 1994 it merged into Three Valleys Water.   It was the successor to smaller local water companies such as the Abbots Langley Water Company,  and reached its final size when it acquired the Watford Corporation's water undertaking in 1973.
