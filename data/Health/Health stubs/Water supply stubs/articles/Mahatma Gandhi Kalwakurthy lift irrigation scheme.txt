Mahatma Gandhi Kalwakurthy lift irrigation project (KLIP) is a lift irrigation project on River Krishna located in Mahbubnagar district in Telangana, India.   The lift canal starts from the back waters of Srisailam Dam near Kollapur.    The gravity driven, 100 kilometer canal provides cultivation for nearly 4,00,000 acres in 300 villages located in constituencies of Kollapur, Wanaparthy, Nagarkurnool, Kalwakurthy, Jadcherla and Achampet.   The Kalwakurthy Lift Irrigation Scheme foundation stone was laid way back in 1984. It was started again in 2005 but delayed again.  In August 2014 the work started with a spending of ₹2100 crores and completed in October 2017 and water was released by irrigation Minister, Harish Rao. It took a little over three decades to be completed.  The original design for the project was 25 TMC water capacity, but later it was increased to 40 TMC to reach the prescribed target. This project provides water to the most drought prone areas in Mahbubnagar. The water is sourced from Krishna river, by lifting water 300 meters above river level and channeling into the reservoir.  Achampet Branch Canal will be expanded by a length of 14 km, creating an additional ayacut of 15,000 acres (10,000 acres in Uppunuthala mandal and 5,000 acre) in Achampet mandal. Around 51 balancing reservoirs with 20 TMC water capacity are proposed under MGKLIS for assured water supply to the ayacut. They are scheduled to be completed by June 2019. The Buddaram Peddavagu Lake is proposed to be converted into a reservoir in 2018. It was conceptualised and conceived way back in 2008, due to delays it is completing in June 2019. With this reservoir, the entire parched lands under Wanaparthy district will get water for irrigation. This would also ensure continuous flow of water This project has three lifts, first lift in Eluru (Kollapur mandal) second in Jonnalaboguda village and third lift in Gudipally village. There are small reservoirs yet to be constructed to store the water which is lifted from the backwaters of the Srisailam. This project serves water through canals which will fill the lakes of all the villages and towns present in the five constituencies of Mahabubnagar district. ABB partnered for industrial-strength water pumping technology with Andritz AG, to deploy five of its massive and high-capacity 30-megawatt (MW), 11-kilovolt (kV) motors, each capable of pumping 23,000 litres per second. ABB also supplied substation equipment, transformers, and a digitally-enabled supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) monitoring system that ensures a steady and reliable drawing of power from the grid and smooth pumping of water into the reservoir. 2.   - Kalwakurthy’s two more lifts commissioned Coordinates: 16°06′05″N 78°23′59″E﻿ / ﻿16.10139°N 78.39972°E﻿ / 16.10139; 78.39972
