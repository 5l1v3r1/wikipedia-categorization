Dos Amigos Pumping Plant is a water pumping plant of the California State Water Project, located 10 miles (16 km) south of Los Banos, on Interstate 5, within central Merced County, in the San Joaquin Valley, central California.  The plant is the second pumping plant for the California Aqueduct and the South Bay Aqueduct. It provides the necessary fluid head (potential energy) for the California Aqueduct to flow for approximately 95 miles (153 km) to where the Coastal Branch splits from the "main line" approximately 10 miles (16 km) south-southeast of Kettleman City.   After the Coastal Branch junction, the line continues south by gravity another 66 miles (106 km) to the Buena Vista Pumping Plant.
