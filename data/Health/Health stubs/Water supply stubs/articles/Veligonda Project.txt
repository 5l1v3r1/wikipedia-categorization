 Veligonda Project is an under construction irrigation project located in Prakasam district in Andhra Pradesh, India.  When completed, the project will provide irrigational facilities to 459,000 Acres and drinking water to 1.5 million people in 29 Mandals of fluorine and drought affected areas in Prakasam district, Nellore district and Kadapa district by diverting 43.5 TMC of floodwater of Krishna River from foreshore of Srisailam Reservoir near Kollamvagu and proposed to store in Nallamalasagar Reservoir. The water for the project is drawn through two 18.8 km long tunnels across Nallamala hills. The project has been renamed to Poola Subbaiah irrigation project.   The construction includes two parallel tunnels of 18.8 km with 9.2 m and 7 m internal diameter and 21.6 km Flood flow canal for the water transmission system linking with Srisailam Reservoir up to Guntur-Kurnool road. The project is being implemented by double shielded tunnel boring machine to make the tunnel without disturbing wildlife in the Nagarjunsagar-Srisailam Tiger Reserve.  As of June 2018, 15.2  km of tunnel digging had been completed for the first tunnel, and 10.8 km had been completed for the second tunnel. Only a little progress has been made in the past few years by contractors citing the equipment problems and payment issues with government. Re-tendering of incomplete works is being done by terminating earlier contracts for both tunnels.  Completion of first phase works are not expected before December 2019.
