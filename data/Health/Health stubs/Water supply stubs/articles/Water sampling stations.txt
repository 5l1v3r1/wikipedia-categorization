To enhance water quality monitoring in a drinking water network, water sampling stations are installed at various points along the network's route. These sampling stations are typically positioned at street level, where they connect to a local water main, and are designed as enclosed, secured boxes containing a small sink and spigot to aid in sample collection. Collected samples are analyzed for bacteria, chlorine levels, pH, inorganic and organic pollutants, turbidity, odor, and many other water quality indicators. In the United States, water sampling stations aid in public infrastructural safety in regards to water quality monitoring, and help municipalities comply with federal and state drinking water regulations. New York City has 965 sampling stations that are distributed based on population density, water pressure zones, proximity to water mains, and accessibility. The stations rise about 4Â½ feet above the ground and are made of heavy cast iron. Using these stations, the New York City Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) collects more than 1,200 water samples per month from up to 546 locations.
