Mucinous cystadenoma is a benign cystic tumor lined by a mucinous epithelium. It is a type of cystic adenoma (cystadenoma). Mucinous cystadenomata may arise in a number of locations; however, mucinous cystadenoma at different locations are not generally considered to be related to one another. Mucinous cystadenomas may be found in the:  Mucinous cystadenomas make up 15–20% of all ovarian tumors. They often become very large and can extend up into the abdomen.  These tumors are usually evaluated using ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI. Findings on imaging studies are nonspecific. These ovarian tumors are usually multi-septated, cystic masses with thin walls. They also contain varying amounts of solid tissue which consists of proliferating stromal tissue, papillae, or malignant tumor cells.  Benign mucinous cystadenomas compose 80% of mucinous ovarian tumors  and 20–25% of benign ovarian tumors overall. The peak incidence occurs between 30 and 50 years of age. Benign tumors are bilateral in 5–10% of cases.
