Autoimmune Oophoritis is a rare autoimmune disease where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the ovaries.  This causes the ovaries to have inflammation, atrophy and fibrosis. The changes to the ovaries can cause them to not function properly. The underlying cause of Autoimmune Oophoritis is unknown. In many cases Autoimmune Oophoritis can be apart of lupus, pernicious anemia, myasthenia gravis, other autoimmune conditions. Autoimmune Oophoritis can be associated with autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type I and type II.  Diagnosis involves a special blood test which looks for anti-steroid or anti-ovarian antibodies, a pelvic ultrasound to look for enlarged cystic ovaries and other type of tests to rule out other issues that can be apart of Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (POI).   This article incorporates public domain material from websites or documents of the National Institutes of Health.
