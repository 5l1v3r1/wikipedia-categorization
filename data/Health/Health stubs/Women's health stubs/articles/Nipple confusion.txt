Nipple confusion is the tendency of an infant to unsuccessfully adapt between nursing at the breast and then with a nipple on a bottle. The same confusion can happen when the baby is put back onto the breast. Nipple confusion can turn into nipple refusal in which the baby refuses both the nipple of the bottle and breastfeeding.  Preventing nipple confusion requires avoiding bottles and pacifiers. An infant that is used to feeding at the breast and gets switched to a bottle cannot use the same technique as latching on to the breast. An infant who gets used to nipple on a bottle and fast-flowing milk can have trouble making the transition. Nipple confusion can result in sub optimal nutrition for the baby and using artificial nipples is discouraged by the World Health Organization.  The American College of Pediatrics recommends the use of pacifiers to prevent sudden infant death syndrome. This, however, conflicts with the recommendations of the World Health Organization to discourage the use of artificial nipples because it may cause nipple confusion and then inadequate nutrition.
