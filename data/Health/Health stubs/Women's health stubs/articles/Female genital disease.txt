A female genital disease is a condition that affects the female reproductive system. Malformations can be congenital.  They are classified by location of the malformation, such as uterine malformation. An example is oophoritis. Alternatively, female genital diseases can be more strictly classified by location of the disease, which, in turn, can be broadly divided between diseases that affect the female internal genitalia and those that affect the female external genitalia.
