Vaginal seeding, also known as microbirthing ,  is a procedure whereby vaginal fluids (and hence vaginal microbes) are applied to a new-born child delivered by caesarean section. The purpose is to create a biome that is equivalent to a baby delivered vaginally. The motivation is that some research has linked delivery by caesarean section to a higher rate of asthma, propensity to become overweight, and autoimmune conditions.  Vaginal fluids can host a wide variety of pathogens, and therefore there is a risk of causing infection by using this procedure.  An editorial in The BMJ concluded that "the small risk of harm cannot be justified without evidence of benefit."  Doctors in Denmark and the UK said there was too little evidence to support vaginal seeding, and it may be doing more harm than good.
