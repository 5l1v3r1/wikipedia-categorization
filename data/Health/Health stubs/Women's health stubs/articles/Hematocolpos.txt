Hematocolpos is a medical condition in which the vagina fills with menstrual blood. It is often caused by the combination of menstruation with an imperforate hymen.   It is sometimes seen in Robinow syndrome, uterus didelphys, or other vaginal anomalies. A related disorder is hematometra, where the uterus fills with menstrual blood.  It presents after puberty as primary amenorrhoea, recurrent pelvic pain with a pelvic mass. This can be caused by a congenital stenosis of the cervix, or by a complication of a surgical treatment.   Mucometrocolpos is the accumulation of mucous secretions behind an imperforate hymen.   Mucometrocolpos can sometimes cause abdominal distention.      It is generally treated surgically, with a hymenotomy or other surgery to remove any tissue that blocks the menstrual flow.
