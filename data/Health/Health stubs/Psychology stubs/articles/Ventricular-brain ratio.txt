Ventricular-brain ratio (VBR), also known as the ventricle-to-brain ratio or ventricle-brain ratio, is the ratio of total ventricle area to total brain area,  which can be calculated with planimetry from brain imagining techniques such as CT scans.  It is a common measure of ventricular dilation or cerebral atrophy in patients with traumatic brain injury or hydrocephalus ex vacuo.  VBR also tends to increase with age.  Generally, a higher VBR means a worse prognosis for recovering from a brain injury.  For example, VBR is significantly correlated with performance on the Luria-Nebraska neuropsychological battery.  Studies have found people with schizophrenia have larger third ventricles and VBR.  Correlational studies have found relationships between ventricle-brain ratio and binge eating and inversely with plasma thyroid hormone concentration.
