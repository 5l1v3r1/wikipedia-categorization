Silencing is a visual illusion in which a set of objects that change in luminance, hue, size, or shape appears to stop changing when it moves. It was discovered by Jordan Suchow  and George Alvarez  of Harvard University, and described in a paper published in Current Biology.  Silencing won the Neural Correlate Society's "Best visual illusion of the year contest" in 2011.
