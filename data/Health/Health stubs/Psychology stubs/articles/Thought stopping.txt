Thought stopping is a cognitive intervention technique prescribed by therapists (psychologists and psychiatrists) with the goal of interrupting and removing problematic recurring thought patterns. The problem thought could be a worry, an obsession, an urge, an unwanted habit, etc.  One approach is to command, yell, or mind scream "Stop!" whenever the unwanted thought recurs, and then think of a more positive or productive thought to replace it with.  Another technique is to wear a rubber band on the wrist which the patient snaps to punish himself whenever the unwanted thought surfaces. Dismissing the thought at will as soon as it is noticed is another method.
