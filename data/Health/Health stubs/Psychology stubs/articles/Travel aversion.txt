Travel aversion, not to be confused with hodophobia,  is a condition experienced by people that dislike or disapprove traveling. People who abstain from travel may see traveling more as a chore than as a leisure.  Travel-averse people feel well enough at home, and do not see the point in traveling. The reason may be that the effort required to organize a trip is too demanding to them, especially since they are not prepared, and the stress included in traveling and orienting oneself in an unknown environment may prevent any enjoyment during the travel. A travel aversive will typically not enjoy his or her staying abroad, especially if he or she is traveling alone for a short period. Most of the reasons motivating people to travel seems futile to travel aversives. Their main considerations include the high resource consumption induced by traveling, which entails that traveling should be reserved to necessary cases, and should be avoided otherwise. Traveling is advanced as a non-ecological lifestyle, and such people enjoy simple living, in which one individual seeks to satisfy only its needs, and heavily considers the reasons for satisfying his wants. Traveling appears to them as another facet of consumerism. Travel aversives do not experience post-vacation blues. They feel rather happy about being back into their usual habits. Travel aversives tend to look for a stable lifestyle devoid of any unforeseen events, so as to feel comfortable about the near future. Traveling does not fit in this lifestyle, since many contingencies can happen, with sometimes highly displeasing consequences.
