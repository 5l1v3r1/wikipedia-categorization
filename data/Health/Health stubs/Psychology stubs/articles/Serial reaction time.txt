Serial reaction time (SRT) is a commonly used parameter for measuring implicit learning.  In a SRT task, participants are asked to repeatedly respond to a fixed set of stimuli in which each cue signals that a particular response (i.e., button press) needs to be made. Unbeknownst to the participant, there are probabilities governing the transition between the cues, and thus required responses following one cue have some predictability. As a result, reaction time (RTs) to these cues becomes increasingly fast as subjects learn and utilize these transition probabilities.   Combined with artificial grammar learning methods, this paradigm has been used to study a range of learning phenomena including language structure learning and syntactic priming
