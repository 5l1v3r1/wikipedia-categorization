Snackwell effect is a phenomenon that states that dieters will eat more low-calorie cookies, such as SnackWells, than they otherwise would for normal cookies.    The term is also used for similar effects in other settings, such as energy consumption, where it is termed the "rebound effect". For example, according to a 2008 study, people with energy-efficient washing machines wash more clothes.   People with energy-efficient lights leave them on longer, and lose 5-12% of the expected energy savings of 80%.  In the Seinfeld episode "The Postponement," Rabbi Glickman goes into a brief diatribe about the Snackwell effect in an off topic discussion with Elaine.
