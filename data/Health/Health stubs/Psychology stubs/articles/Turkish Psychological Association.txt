The Turkish Psychological Association (in Turkish, Türk Psikologlar Dernegi; acronym is the TPD) was founded in 1976.  Their headquarters is in Ankara, Turkey.  The Turkish Psychological Association follows several main objectives: Their Code of Ethics was adopted in 2004.  It was created by Yesim Korkut (PhD), Serra Muderrisoglu (PhD), and Melis Tanik (PsyD) in Istanbul.  In June 2014, the TPD launched a special unit to protect LGBT citizens from homophobia, transphobia, and other forms of discrimination in society that LGBT individuals face. This unit is called the LGBTI Force.  The unit hosts fundraisers, projects, and meetings to spread awareness of the discrimination and promote a stance against conversion of LGBT citizens. Their first meeting was 29 June 2014.  Following the suicide of Turkish transgender sex worker Eylül Cansın on 5 January 2015, the LGBTI Force released a concerned announcement of how one widely broadcast suicide often leads to more suicides, especially among adolescents and young adults. At their young age, depression and suicidal thoughts and/or actions are often considered "contagious," in a way. They encouraged media to avoid detailed descriptions of Eylül's suicide as to prevent the cultivation of ideas in any of the viewers minds.
