Task-invoked pupillary response (also known as the "Task-Evoked pupillary response") is a pupillary response caused by a cognitive load imposed on a human and as a result of the decrease in parasympathetic activity in the peripheral nervous system.  It is found to result in a linear increase in pupil dilation as the demand a task places on the working memory increases. Beatty evaluated task-invoked pupillary response in different tasks for short-term memory, language processing, reasoning, perception, sustained attention and selective attention and found that it fulfils Kahnemanâ€™s three criteria for indicating processing load.   That is, it can reflect differences in processing load within a task, between different tasks and between individuals.  It is used as an indicator of cognitive load levels in psychophysiology research.
