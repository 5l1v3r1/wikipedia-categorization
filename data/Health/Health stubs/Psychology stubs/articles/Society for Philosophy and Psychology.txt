The Society for Philosophy and Psychology (SPP) is a professional organization in North America that promotes discussion and research at the intersection of philosophy, psychology and cognitive science. Its stated purpose is "to promote interaction between philosophers, psychologists and other cognitive scientists on issues of common concern."
