The Thurstone Personality Schedule was one of the first personality tests.  It was published by Louis Leon Thurstone and Thelma Gwinn Thurstone in 1930.  It underwent many revisions and adaptions. 6 year test-retest reliability was 0.53 in one study.  In 1952 around 200 firms used the test for personnel screening.
