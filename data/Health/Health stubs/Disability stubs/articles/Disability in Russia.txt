Disability in Russia  Many disabled face poor provision of facilities, and disabled children are commonly institutionalized as disability is considered shameful and must be hidden.        Such discrimination is widespread even though Russia is a party to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, having signed the treaty on 24 September 2008, and ratified it four years later, on 25 September 2012.  In the Pre-soviet era Commissariats for Invalid Welfare were responsible for services for disabled people. Welfare co-operatives, mutual aid societies and charitable societies were also involved. Between 1929 to 1932 it was estimated that the disabled population  was made up of 43% war veterans, 32% industrially injured and the remainder through accidents and disability at birth. In March 1921 775000 wooden arms and legs for disabled soldiers had been produced. In 1926 there were estimated to be 15 blind persons per 10,000 population.  There were up to 21000 disabled people in homes.  Russia has competed at the Paralympic Games as different nations in its history. As part of the Soviet Union at the 1988 Summer and Winter Games.
