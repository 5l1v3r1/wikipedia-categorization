Capability Scotland, formerly the Scottish Council for the Care of Spastics is a Scottish charity. Based in Edinburgh, it provides education, employment and care for disabled people. The Scottish Council for the Care of Spastics was founded in 1946 by a group of parents and health professionals. Its aim was to support children with cerebral palsy. The first school was opened at Westerlea, Edinburgh, in 1948. In the early 1960s the charity began organising employment opportunities for disabled people, and in 1973 the first adult residential home was established.  In 1996 the organisation changed its name to Capability Scotland. Capability Scotland is a member of Disability Agenda Scotland together with Sense Scotland, ENABLE Scotland, RNIB Scotland, Action on Hearing Loss Scotland, and the Scottish Association for Mental Health.
