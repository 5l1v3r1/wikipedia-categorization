There are an estimated 16 million people with disabilities in Brazil. Although 9 million of these are of working age, only 1 million are in the labor force.  Brazil is a party to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, having signed the treaty on 30 March 2007 and ratified it on 1 August 2008.  Brazil's Law 7853 criminalizes discrimination based on disability, and other legal protections also exist.  At least five major associations work to enable the participation of Brazilians with disabilities in sport.
