Louis Antoine (23 November 1888 â€“ 8 February 1971) was a French mathematician who discovered Antoine's necklace, which J. W. Alexander used to construct  Antoine's horned sphere. He lost his eyesight in the first World War, at the age of 29. Henri Lebesgue suggested that Antoine study two- and three-dimensional topology.
