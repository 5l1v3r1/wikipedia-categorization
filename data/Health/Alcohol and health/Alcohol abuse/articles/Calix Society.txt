The Calix Society is an organization in the United States founded in the 1940s which aims at addressing the particular spiritual needs of Catholics recovering from alcohol addiction. It affiliates closely with Alcoholics Anonymous, and believes in the effectiveness of the twelve-step program, but focuses on enabling Catholics who may have abandoned or neglected their faith during active alcoholism to return and have the fellowship of other Catholics in recovery. It promotes total abstinence for those in recovery, taking inspiration from Matt Talbot,  and is concerned with the spiritual development and the sanctification of the whole personality of its members. The organization's motto is "substituting the cup that stupifies for the cup that sanctifies". The group has expanded since the 1940s to have active groups in 19 US states and in the UK.
