Alcoholic hepatitis is hepatitis (inflammation of the liver) due to excessive intake of alcohol.  It is usually found in association with fatty liver, an early stage of alcoholic liver disease, and may contribute to the progression of fibrosis, leading to cirrhosis. Signs and symptoms of alcoholic hepatitis include jaundice, ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity), fatigue and hepatic encephalopathy (brain dysfunction due to liver failure). Mild cases are self-limiting, but severe cases have a high risk of death. Severe cases may be treated with glucocorticoids. Alcoholic hepatitis is characterized by myriad symptoms, which may include feeling unwell, enlargement of the liver, development of fluid in the abdomen (ascites), and modest elevation of liver enzyme levels (as determined by liver function tests).  Alcoholic hepatitis can vary from mild with only liver enzyme elevation to severe liver inflammation with development of jaundice, prolonged prothrombin time, and even liver failure.  Severe cases are characterized by either obtundation (dulled consciousness) or the combination of elevated bilirubin levels and prolonged prothrombin time; the mortality rate in both severe categories is 50% within 30 days of onset. Alcoholic hepatitis is distinct from cirrhosis caused by long-term alcohol consumption.  Alcoholic hepatitis can occur in patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease and alcoholic cirrhosis.  Alcoholic hepatitis by itself does not lead to cirrhosis, but cirrhosis is more common in patients with long term alcohol consumption.  Some alcoholics develop acute hepatitis as an inflammatory reaction to the cells affected by fatty change. This is not directly related to the dose of alcohol. Some people seem more prone to this reaction than others.  This is called alcoholic steatonecrosis and the inflammation probably predisposes to liver fibrosis. Some signs and pathological changes in liver histology include: If chronic liver disease is also present: The diagnosis is made in a patient with history of significant alcohol intake who develops worsening liver function tests, including elevated bilirubin and aminotransferases.  The ratio of aspartate aminotransferase to alanine aminotransferase is usually 2 or more.  In most cases, the liver enzymes do not exceed 500.  The changes on liver biopsy are important in confirming a clinical diagnosis. Clinical practice guidelines by the American College of Gastroenterology have recommended corticosteroid treatment.  Patients should be risk stratified using a MELD Score or Child-Pugh score.
