This is a list of notable people who died either from the effects of excessive alcohol consumption or alcohol poisoning. The Journal of the American Medical Association defines alcoholism as "a primary, chronic disease characterized by impaired control over drinking, preoccupation with the drug alcohol, use of alcohol despite adverse consequences, and distortions in thinking, most notably denial."  The majority of people in this list died from causes brought on by alcoholism. In some cases, they died of multiple causes, with alcoholism being a major factor. Exceptions to this are those who died from accidental death, such as alcohol poisoning caused by binge drinking. In these cases, misuse of drugs sometimes contributed to the person dying. Deaths caused indirectly by alcohol, such as in a car accident are not listed here. The table below lists people who died as a direct result of alcohol misuse. Dates of death are listed instead of dates of birth.  Wiener, Norbert (1956). I am a mathematician: The later life of a prodigy (later republished by MIT Press ed.).

William Feller wrote to Richard Courant: "Carleman is of the touching [rührend] opinion that one should execute [an die Wand stellen] all Jews and immigrants (which, however, he only tells his assistant after consuming a nonnegative [nichtnegativ] amount of alcohol)".
