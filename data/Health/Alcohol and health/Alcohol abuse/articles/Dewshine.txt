Dewshine is a term coined for the non-commercial mixture of the beverage Mountain Dew with alcohol, notably methanol. Methanol is toxic to humans, and in January 2016 the mixture resulted in the reported deaths of two Tennessee high school students, Logan Stephenson and J. D. Byram.  The methanol in this case was believed to come from racing fuel.
