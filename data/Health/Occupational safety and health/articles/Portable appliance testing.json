Many equipment manufacturers recommend testing at regular intervals to ensure continual safety; the interval between tests depending on both the type of appliance and the environment in which it is to be used. The European Low Voltage Directive governs the manufacture or importation of electrical appliances. Compliance to this has to be declared and indicated by the display of the CE mark on the product. The responsibility for this lies with the manufacturer or the importer and is policed by Trading Standards.\n</p><p>Testing equipment has been specifically developed for PAT inspections, based on the testing equipment used by manufacturers to ensure compliance with the <a href=\"/wiki/British_Standard_Code_of_Practice\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"British Standard Code of Practice\">British Standard Code of Practice</a> and European product standards relevant to that type of appliance.

Thinking about the type of equipment in use, and how it was used, the HSE looked back at the results from its annual testing of portable appliances across its estate over the last five years. Using the results of the previous tests, the HSE decided that further portable appliance tests are not needed within the foreseeable future or at all for certain types of portable equipment. Also, they decided to continue to monitor any faults reported as a result of user checks and visual inspections and review its maintenance system if evidence suggests that it needs revising. Electrical equipment will continue to be maintained by a series of user checks and visual inspections by staff that have had some training.\n</p><p>Annual portable appliance testing is not always necessary in low risk environments.\nYou do not need to be qualified as an electrician to carry out visual inspections.\nRegular user checks and visual inspections can be a good method of maintaining portable electric equipment.\nFor landlords maintaining legal requirements it is not compulsory for them to have all appliances tested, but they do need to show a \"duty of care\" and most letting agents recommend that a test certificate is obtained.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Origins_in_UK\">Origins in UK</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Portable_appliance_testing&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Origins in UK\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The earliest formal portable appliance testing and inspection of both electrical installations and high risk equipment was introduced in the UK in government estates.

Extensive record-keeping was made into log-books and generally the equipment used was an insulation resistance tester, simple hand tools and visual inspection. Evidence of testing was clearly visible to workers in the form of \"passed\", \"tested for electrical safety\" and \"do not use after...\" labels affixed to various parts of the electrical equipment used. This early testing and inspection was done under a planned maintenance scheme and pre-dated both the <a href=\"/wiki/Health_and_Safety_at_Work_Act_1974\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Health and Safety at Work Act 1974\">Health and Safety at Work Act 1974</a> and the <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Electricity_at_Work_Act_1989&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Electricity at Work Act 1989 (page does not exist)\">Electricity at Work Act 1989</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Site_and_campus_requirements.2C_events_and_contractors\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Site_and_campus_requirements,_events_and_contractors\">Site and campus requirements, events and contractors</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Portable_appliance_testing&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Site and campus requirements, events and contractors\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In the UK there is no legal instrument that requires a sub-contractor to ensure that all tools and equipment are PAT inspected before bringing onto a site of work.  Neither is there any legal instrument which obliges the site owner to ensure third-party equipment is PAT inspected either by themselves or the equipment owner.\n</p><p>The internal policies of many UK businesses and educational establishments make mistaken reference to PAT inspection being a legal requirement under the Electricity at Work Regulations, which is false.  Having such a policy is legitimate for internal reasons, but it is not underwritten by law, it is only their interpretation.  Therefore, it is not a legal requirement to have a PAT inspection sticker or certificate, the obligation is that equipment must be safe.\n</p><p>The HSE recommend policies use phrases such as \"Equipment that is brought onto site for an event must be in a safe condition\" and refrain from overzealous statements such as \"must be PAT inspected\" which can be restrictive without improving safety.  Overall it is safer if a competent person makes a visual inspection than if a layman merely observes the presence of a sticker.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Carrying_out_PAT\">Carrying out PAT</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Portable_appliance_testing&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Carrying out PAT\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>This can be done by hiring an external company to test all the electrical products in a business (someone who has had some PAT training, either by an official qualification or by attending a health and safety course offered by some electrical health and safety companies) or it can be done in-house by a competent person.
