The Cytotoxic hazard symbol is a triangle with the letter "C" inside it and is used to label biomedical waste bags and containers. The symbol is generally used as a warning, so that those potentially exposed to the substances will know to take precautions.  Cytotoxic waste, the by-product of cytotoxic drug therapy administered to patients (such as chemotherapy), typically includes all drug administrative equipment (e.g. needles, syringes, dripsets etc.) as well as all gowns and body fluids/waste from patients under going such treatment.
