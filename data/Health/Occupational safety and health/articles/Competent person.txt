A competent person in occupational safety and health is a person who is designated by a company to ensure that the company's health and safety responsibilities are being met.  This may be a legal obligation required of the company, to ensure that the business understands, and can act on, the health and safety risks that might occur during their particular type of work.  In the United Kingdom, recognition of competence is defined as requiring "sufficient training and experience or knowledge and other qualities" to be able to effectively oversee health and safety in the business,  although specialised industries may have additional, more specific requirements.
