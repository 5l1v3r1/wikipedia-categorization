  ISO 45001 is an ISO standard for management systems of occupational health and safety (OH&S), published in March 2018.  The goal of ISO 45001 is the reduction of occupational injuries and diseases.  The standard is based on OHSAS 18001, labour standards, conventions, and guidelines of the International Labour Organization, and national standards.  ISO 45001 also follows the High Level Structure of other ISO standards like ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 14001:2015 which makes integration of these standards much easier.  ISO 45001 was proposed in 25 October 2013. The committee ISO/PC 283, created in 2013, had direct responsibility of the standardization process.  At least 70 countries contributed to the drafting process.  Preparation and committee work lasted until December 2015. From 2015 to 2017, a first draft failed to gain sufficient approval by ISO members and was revised in a second draft, which was approved and refined in a final draft.  In the final vote the standard garnered 62 votes in favour, nine abstentions and four votes against from France, India, Spain, and Turkey.  The standard was published on 12 March 2018.  ISO 45001 is anticipated to replace OHSAS 18001 over three years following its publication. It uses the management system standard structure guideline Annex SL to allow for simplified integration with other management system standards, such as ISO 9001 and ISO 14001.  The International Accreditation Forum has published requirements for migration from OHSAS 18001 to ISO 45001.  ISO/IEC TS 17021-10:2018 is a technical specification setting out competence requirements for auditing and certification of ISO 45001.  ISO 45001 was adopted as a national standard by Albania, Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Chile, Costa Rica, Croatia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Malaysia, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Singapore, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and Uruguay.N-  Adoption as a national standard is under consideration in Australia.  n-  a
