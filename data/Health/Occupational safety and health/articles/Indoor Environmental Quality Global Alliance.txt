The Indoor Environmental Quality Global Alliance (IEQ-GA) was initiated in 2014     aiming to improve the actual, delivered indoor environmental quality in buildings through coordination, education, outreach and advocacy. The alliance works to supply information, guidelines and knowledge on the indoor environmental quality (IEQ) in buildings and workplaces,  and to provide occupants in buildings and workplaces with an acceptable indoor environmental quality ((indoor air quality (IAQ), thermal conditions, visual quality, and acoustical quality)) and help promote implementation in practice of knowledge from research on the field. The group has already begun work to collect and critique IEQ standards and is organising and presenting programmes at the conferences of member organisations     and others. The Alliance was officially launched on June 29, 2014 during ASHRAE’s 2014 Annual Conference in Seattle; a memorandum of understanding was signed and the Alliance was formed.   Bill Bahnfleth, ASHRAE’s 2013-2014 president, appointed an ad-hoc committee to look at ways for industry groups to cooperate and address aspects of indoor environmental quality and health.  Founding members of the Indoor Environmental Quality Global Alliance include organisations that broadly deal with the indoor environments as well as those specialised primarily in Indoor Air Quality(IAQ).  The Alliance’s current partners include the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA), the Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre (AIVC), the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) the Air & Waste Management Association (A&WMA), the Indoor Air Quality Association (IAQA), and the Federation of European Heating and Air-Conditioning Associations (REHVA)  . The Alliance is also supported by governmental organisations such as the World Health Organization.
