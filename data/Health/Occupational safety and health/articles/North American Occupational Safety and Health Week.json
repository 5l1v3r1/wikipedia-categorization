The <a href=\"/wiki/American_Society_of_Safety_Engineers\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"American Society of Safety Engineers\">American Society of Safety Engineers</a> (ASSE) partners with the <a href=\"/wiki/Canadian_Society_of_Safety_Engineering\" title=\"Canadian Society of Safety Engineering\">Canadian Society of Safety Engineering</a> (CSSE) to raise public awareness about safety in the workplace in North America during NAOSH week. This is one of the major tools that ASSE and its 34,000<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources.

In addition, ASSE assists charities, provides teen worker safety programs, and donates personal protective equipment (PPE) as part of NAOSH Week.\n</p><p>During the months leading up to NAOSH Week, ASSE holds its popular children's \"safety-on-the-job\" poster contest (ages 5\u201314) which supports Society members, and educates children on the importance of workplace safety. The contest runs annually from September 19 through February 14.\n</p><p>Each year provinces and states, cities and counties support NAOSH week and local ASSE members by sponsoring and passing proclamations and resolutions in support of occupational SH&amp;E practitioners who work to prevent accidents, injuries and occupational diseases, create safer work and leisure environments and develop safer products. \n</p><p>ASSE honors its members who have gone above and beyond in supporting NAOSH week and the profession with the annual ASSE North American Occupational Safety and Health (NAOSH) Week Champion. The awards are presented each year at the ASSE Professional Development Conference.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"External_links\">External links</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=North_American_Occupational_Safety_and_Health_Week&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: External links\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.naosh.org/english/\">Official website</a></li></ul>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw2163\nCached time: 20180916063127\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.040 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.060 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 131/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 1815/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 454/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 11/40\nExpensive parser function count: 1/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\nLua time usage: 0.019/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 829 KB/50 MB\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   52.630      1 Template:Cn\n100.00%   52.630      1 -total\n 70.24%   36.965      1 Template:Fix\n 45.24%   23.810      2 Template:Category_handler\n 19.94%   10.495      1 Template:Delink\n  6.22%    3.276      1 Template:Fix/category\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:13418661-0!canonical and timestamp 20180916063127 and revision id 824713245\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","hidden":"","*":"All_articles_with_unsourced_statements"},{"sortkey":"","hidden":"","*":"Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_May_2015"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Occupational_safety_and_health"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Thematic_weeks"},{"sortkey":"","*":"May_observances"}],"links":[{"ns":14,"exists":"","*":"Category:Articles with unsourced statements from May 2015"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"American Society of Safety Engineers"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Canadian Society of Safety Engineering"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Occupational Safety and Health Administration"},{"ns":4,"exists":"","*":"Wikipedia:Citation needed"}],"templates":[{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Cn"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Citation needed"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Fix"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Category handler"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Fix/category"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Delink"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Unsubst"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Yesno"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/data"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/config"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/shared"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/blacklist"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Namespace detect/data"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Namespace detect/config"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Arguments"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Delink"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:No globals"}],"images":[],"externallinks":["http://www.naosh.org/english/"],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"External links","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"North_American_Occupational_Safety_and_Health_Week","byteoffset":2180,"anchor":"External_links"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"North American Occupational Safety and Health Week","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q7053829"}]}}
