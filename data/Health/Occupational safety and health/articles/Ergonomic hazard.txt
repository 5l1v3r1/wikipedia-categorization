Ergonomic hazards are physical conditions that may pose risk of injury to the musculoskeletal system,  such as the muscles or ligaments of the lower back, tendons or nerves of the hands/wrists, or bones surrounding the knees.  Ergonomic hazards include things such as awkward or extreme postures, whole-body or hand/arm vibration, poorly designed tools, equipment, or workstations, repetitive motion, and poor lighting.  Ergonomic hazards occur in both occupational and non-occupational settings such as in workshops, building sites, offices, home, school, or public spaces and facilities.
