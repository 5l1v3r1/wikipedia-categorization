LTIFR refers to Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate, the number of lost time injuries occurring in a workplace per 1 million hours worked. An LTIFR of 7, for example, shows that 7 lost time injuries occur on a jobsite every 1 million hours worked. The formula gives a picture of how safe a workplace is for its workers. Lost time injuries (LTI) include all on-the-job injuries that require a person to stay away from work more than 24 hours, or which result in death or permanent disability. This definition comes from the Australian standard 1885.1â€“ 1990 Workplace Injury and Disease Recording Standard.
