Companies like Apple and Amazon have begun the process of bringing healthcare onsite in order to save money on costs and better support their employees.  Onsite care allows employers to control healthcare costs themselves, and the business is growing. The market for preventive care and onsite clinics is predicted to double from 2017 to 2027.  More than just workplace wellness, onsite health services can range from simple fitness programs to fully functioning medical clinics. Employers can assess their workforce and offer services like primary care, onsite pharmacy, occupational health, chiropractic and acupuncture, and mental health counseling according to the needs of their employees.
