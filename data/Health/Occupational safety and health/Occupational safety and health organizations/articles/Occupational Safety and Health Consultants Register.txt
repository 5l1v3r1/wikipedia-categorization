The Occupational Safety and Health Consultants Register (OSHCR)  is a public register of UK-based health and safety advice consultants, set up to assist UK employers and business owners with general advice on workplace health and safety issues.  The register was established in response to the Governmentâ€™s October 2010 report on 'Common Sense, Common Safety', which recommended that all health and safety consultants should be accredited to professional bodies and a web-based directory established.  The scheme is voluntary for individuals who provide commercial advice on general health and safety management issues. Consultants who are registered on OSHCR, have been assessed by their professional body and have achieved a set standard based on their qualifications and experience. Each consultant must maintain their continuing professional development, abide by a code of conduct and be committed to giving sensible and proportionate advice to businesses. On launching the register Work and Pensions Minister Chris Grayling said "We have launched an official Occupational Safety and Health Consultants Register for those health and safety practitioners who are properly accredited to one of the professional bodies in the industry.".  Many businesses develop in-house competence to manage their health and safety risks and do not need to use health and safety consultants. Other employers however, may need additional help and the consultants registered on OSHCR will have a status recognised by the participating bodies in the OSHCR scheme. The register enables businesses to search for a consultant by geographical area, industry or topic, to enable them to find someone who will provide specific, tailored advice, relevant to their business needs.
