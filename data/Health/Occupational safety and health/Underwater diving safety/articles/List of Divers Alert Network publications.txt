Divers Alert Network (DAN) is a group of not-for-profit organisations dedicated to improving diving safety for all divers. It was founded in Durham, North Carolina, USA in 1980 at Duke University providing 24/7 telephonic hotline diving medical assistance. Since then the organisation has expanded globally and now has independent regional organisations in North America, Europe, Japan, Asia-Pacific and Southern Africa.   DAN publishes research results on a wide range of matters relating to diving safety and medicine and diving accident analysis, including annual reports on decompression illness and diving fatalities. Most are freely available on the internet, many of these at the Rubicon Research Repository. This list includes publications where one or more authors are staff or members of one of the DAN affiliates, where a large part of the data is from one of the DAN Databases. or where the research was funded by DAN.
