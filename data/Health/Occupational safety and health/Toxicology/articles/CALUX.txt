Chemical Activated LUciferase gene eXpression (CALUX) is a bioassay used in the detection of specific chemicals in samples. It consists of a modified cell line that has a DNA construct with a luciferase reporter gene in conjunction with response elements that can induce transcription of the inserted gene for the light-generating enzyme. The response elements can be varied in order to provide binding sites for other receptors that relate to a chemical of interest that is wished to be detected. The CALUX bioassay has thus been redesigned to detect certain chemicals of interest. Most applications have been oriented in detecting environmentally harmful chemicals like environmental hormones. CALUX is an effect based screening method as it measures the total effect ligands (from a sample) have on a receptor. Unlike chemical analysis, CALUX is thus able to measure all activity on the receptor of interest. This also includes unidentified congeners of certain ligands. Dioxin Responsive (DR)CALUX is a bioassay used in the detection of dioxins and dioxin-like compounds. It is based on the mechanisms of the AhR-pathway.  Chronic activation of the AhR-pathway by these compounds has been shown to cause cancer in the predominantly the liver and can cause developmental defects in vertebrates. DR CALUX is used by companies that want to screen for dioxins and dioxin-like compounds in order to guarantee food safety of their products. Dioxins are considered to be the most toxic man-made chemical.
