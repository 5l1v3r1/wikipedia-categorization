A short-term exposure limit (STEL) is the acceptable average exposure over a short period of time, usually 15 minutes as long as the time-weighted average is not exceeded.   STEL is a term used in occupational health, industrial hygiene and toxicology.  The STEL may be a legal limit in the United States for exposure of an employee to a chemical substance.  The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (U.S. OSHA) has set OSHA-STELs for 1,3-Butadiene,  benzene     and ethylene oxide.   For chemicals, STEL assessments are usually done for 15 minutes and expressed in parts per million (ppm), or sometimes in milligrams per cubic meter (mg/m3). The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists publishes a more extensive list of  STELs as threshold limit values (TLV-STEL).
