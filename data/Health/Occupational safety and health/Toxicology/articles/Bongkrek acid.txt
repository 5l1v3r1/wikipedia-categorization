Bongkrek acid (also known as bongkrekic acid ) is a respiratory toxin more deadly than other mitochondrial poisons such as cyanide or 2,4-dinitrophenol.   There was some dispute regarding the actual structure of bongkrek acid, but this was resolved in 1973, which explains different structures appearing in the literature prior to this date.  It is produced in fermented coconut contaminated by the bacterium Burkholderia gladioli pathovar cocovenenans. In particular, it has been implicated in deaths resulting from eating coconut-based product known as tempe bongkr√®k, which is banned in Indonesia.  It is highly toxic because it inhibits the ADP/ATP translocase, preventing ATP from leaving the mitochondria and providing energy to the rest of the cell.
