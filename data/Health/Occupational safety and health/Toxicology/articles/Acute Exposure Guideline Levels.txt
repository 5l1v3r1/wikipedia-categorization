Acute Exposure Guideline Levels (AEGLs) set levels of chemical concentration that pose a defined level of risk to humans.  These levels are used in preventing and responding to disasters. These guidelines are ascertained for one, short exposure (with a maximum of eight hours) by the air. The AEGL consist of different levels of toxicological effects. It subjects the 4 Ds: detection, discomfort, disability and death. The AEGL values gives the expected effects of exposure to certain compounds. So the compound can provide from detection to discomfort, from discomfort to disability and from disability to death. There are three levels of AEGL-values: AEGL-1, AEGL-2 and AEGL-3. The values of AEGL are determined for varying times of exposure, such as ten minutes, thirty minutes, one hour, four hours and eight hours. AEGLs are mainly used in case of calamities to estimate the exposure to certain compounds.
