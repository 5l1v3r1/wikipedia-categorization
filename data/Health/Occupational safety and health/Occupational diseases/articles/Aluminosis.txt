Aluminosis (also known as aluminium lung) is a restrictive lung disease caused by exposure to aluminum-bearing dust.  Aluminosis is a form of pneumoconiosis that can lead to pulmonary fibrosis  and can be detected by using high-resolution computed tomography.  Workers exposed to aluminium dust are often involved in industries such as explosives manufacturing (where aluminium powder is involved), aluminium welding (and grinding), and bauxite smelting.
