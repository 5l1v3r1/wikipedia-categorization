Infrapatellar bursitis is the inflammation of one or both of the infrapatellar bursa, which are located just below the kneecap.  Symptoms of bursitis commonly include swelling and knee pain.  Bursitis often develops gradually over a period of days to even months but may develop more rapidly, especially in the event of trauma or infection.   Bursitis affecting the superficial infrapatellar bursa is an occupational hazard of persons whose work involves kneeling on hard surfaces.  Depending on the occupation affected it is known by a variety of nicknames, most commonly floor layers' knee, but also plumbers' knee, clergyman's knee, hoe's knee, housewife's knee (prepatellar bursitis).   The deep infrapatellar bursa occasionally also become inflamed, swollen, and painful.  Bursitis in the deep infrapatellar bursa usually develops from chronic overuse of the knee extensor tendon (patellar tendon) as can occur with repetitive flexing of the knee under pressure in work duties or exercise.  Examples might include climbing stairs, jumping, or deep knee bends.
