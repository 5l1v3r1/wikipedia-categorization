A splint is a device used for support or immobilization of a limb or the spine. It can be used in multiple situations, including temporary immobilization of potentially broken bones or damaged joints and support for joints during activity. A "splint" in considered Non-circumferential whereas a "cast" is considered circumferential. A physician must decide the proper treatment, for a particular injury, to promote healing as well as know the benefits and risks. A splint can be used for certain fractures, soft tissue sprains or tendon injuries, or injuries awaiting orthopedic treatment. A splint may be static, not allowing motion, or dynamic, allowing controlled motion.  Different forms of the splint have been used sparingly throughout history; however, the splint gained great popularity as a medical device during the French and Indian War.   Generally consisting of two small wooden planks, the splint was commonly tied around the fracture with rope, cloth, or even rawhide during frontier times in American history.  To this day, the splint is commonly used to secure small fractures and breaks. (See, for example, Henry Gassett Davis.) Hugh Owen Thomas invented several types of splints but it was not until WWI that his nephew, Sir Robert Jones began using the splint on soldiers.
