The disorder was initially claimed to have been identified by occupational therapist Anna Jean Ayres in 1972 .   .  Contrary to that claim, however, is the viewpoint that there currently exists insufficient evidence that the symptoms of SPD represent features of an independent disorder, and SPD is not recognized as a standalone medical diagnosis in the Fifth Edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V) (the most widely recognized diagnostic system for identifying psychiatric disorders) . Claims regarding the benefits of specific therapeutic treatments for SPD have similarly proven to be controversial.    Sensory integration therapy (SIT), the primary form of treatment for SPD performed by occupational therapists or physical therapists, involves providing various forms of sensory stimulation to the patient. Purportedly, these exercises improve how the brain processes and organizes sensory information.   In its position paper in 2012, however, the American Academy of Pediatrics concluded that “research regarding the effectiveness of sensory integration therapy is limited and inconclusive.”  Sensory processing disorder as a specific form of atypical functioning was first described by occupational therapist Anna Jean Ayres (1920–1989).   Original model Ayres's theoretical framework for what she called Sensory Integration Dysfunction was developed after six factor analytic studies of populations of children with learning disabilities, perceptual motor disabilities and normal developing children.  Ayres created the following nosology based on the patterns that appeared on her factor analysis:  Both visual perceptual and auditory language deficits were thought to possess a strong cognitive component and a weak relationship to underlying sensory processing deficits, so they are not considered central deficits in many models of sensory processing. In 1998, Mulligan found a similar pattern of deficits in a confirmatory factor analytic study.    Quadrant model Dunn's nosology uses two criteria:  response type (passive vs active) and sensory threshold to the stimuli (low or high) creating 4 subtypes or quadrants:   Sensory processing model In Miller's nosology  "sensory integration dysfunction" was renamed into "Sensory processing disorder" to facilitate coordinated research work with other fields such as  neurology since "the use of the term sensory integration often applies to a neurophysiologic cellular process rather than a behavioral response to sensory input as connoted by Ayres."   Sensory processing disorders have been classified by propoenents into three categories: sensory modulation disorder, sensory-based motor disorders and sensory discrimination disorders   (as defined in the Diagnostic Classification of Mental Health and Developmental Disorders in Infancy and Early Childhood).   Sensory modulation disorder (SMD) Sensory modulation refers to a complex central nervous system process    by which neural messages that convey information about the intensity, frequency, duration, complexity, and novelty of sensory stimuli are adjusted.   SMD consists of three subtypes:  Sensory-based motor disorder (SBMD) According to proponents, sensory-based motor disorder shows motor output that is disorganized as a result of incorrect processing of sensory information affecting postural control challenges, resulting in postural disorder, or developmental coordination disorder.   The SBMD subtypes are: Sensory discrimination disorder (SDD) Sensory discrimination disorder involves the incorrect processing of sensory information.  .  The SDD subtypes are:  1. Visual   2. Auditory  3. Tactile  4. Gustatory (taste)  5. Olfactory (smell) 6. Vestibular (balance) 7. Proprioceptive (feeling of where parts of the body are located in space) ==Signs and symptoms==    Symptoms may vary according to the disorder's type and subtype, and, it has been claimed, include: Signs of over-responsivity , including, for example, dislike of textures such as those found in fabrics, foods, grooming products or other materials found in daily living, to which most people would not react, and serious discomfort, sickness or threat induced by normal sounds, lights, movements, smells, tastes, or even inner sensations such as heartbeat. Signs of under-responsivity, including sluggishness and lack of responsiveness; and  Sensory cravings, including, for example, fidgeting, impulsiveness, and/or seeking or making loud, disturbing noises; Sensorimotor-based problems, including slow and uncoordinated movements or poor handwriting. Sensory discrimination problems, that might manifest themselves in behaviors such as things constantly dropped. Critics have noted that what proponents claim are symptoms of SPD are both broad and, in some cases, represent very common, and not necessarily abnormal or atypical, childhood characteristics.  The checklist of symptoms on the website of the SPD Foundation, for example, includes such warning signs as “My infant/toddler has problems eating,” “My child has difficulty being toilet trained,” “My child is in constant motion,” and “My child gets in everyone else's space and/or touches everything around him.” -- "symptoms" which read much like the day-to-day complaints of an average parent.  Although sensory processing disorder is accepted in the Diagnostic Classification of Mental Health and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood (DC:0-3R), it is not recognized as a mental disorder in medical manuals such as the ICD-10  or the DSM-5.  Diagnosis is primarily arrived at by the use of standardized tests, standardized questionnaires, expert observational scales, and free play observation at an occupational therapy gym. Observation of functional activities might be carried at school and home as well. Depending on the country, diagnosis is made by different professionals, such as occupational therapists, psychologists, learning specialists, physiotherapists and/or speech and language therapists.  In some countries it is recommended to have a full psychological and neurological evaluation if symptoms are too severe. Standardized tests Standardized questionnaires Other tests The large number of different forms and tools of assessment listed here reflects what critics have argued is a fundamental problem with the diagnosis process: SPD researchers have yet to agree on a proven, standardized diagnostic tool, a problem that undermines the ability of researchers to define the boundaries of the disorder.   It has been estimated by proponents that up to 16.5% of elementary school aged children present elevated SOR behaviors in the tactile or auditory modalities.  This figure is larger than what previous studies with smaller samples had shown: an estimate of 5–13% of elementary school aged children.  Critics have noted that such a high incidence for just one of the subtypes of SPD raises questions about the degree to which SPD is a specific and clearly identifiable disorder.    Proponents have also claimed that adults may also show signs of sensory processing difficulties and would benefit for sensory processing therapies  , although this work has yet to distinguish between those with SPD symptoms alone vs adults whose processing abnormalities are associated with other disorders, such as autism and Asperger's syndrome.   Sensory integration therapy   The main form of sensory integration therapy is a type of occupational therapy that places a child in a room specifically designed to stimulate and challenge all of the senses. During the session, the therapist works closely with the child to provide a level of sensory stimulation that the child can cope with, and encourage movement within the room. Sensory integration therapy is driven by four main principles: Sensory processing therapy This therapy retains all of the above-mentioned four principles and adds:  The treatments themselves may involve a variety of activities and interventions (for example, prism lenses). Children with hypo-reactivity may be exposed to strong sensations such as stroking with a brush, vibrations or rubbing. Play may involve a range of materials to stimulate the senses such as play dough or finger painting.  Children with hyper-reactivity, on the other hand, may be exposed to peaceful activities including quiet music and gentle rocking in a softly lit room. Treats and rewards may be used to encourage children to tolerate activities they would normally avoid.  While occupational therapists using a sensory integration frame of reference work on increasing a child's ability to adequately process sensory input, other OTs may focus on environmental accommodations that parents and school staff can use to enhance the child's function at home, school, and in the community.   These may include selecting soft, tag-free clothing, avoiding fluorescent lighting, and providing ear plugs for "emergency" use (such as for fire drills). Evaluation of treatment effectiveness Some of these treatments (for example, sensorimotor handling) have a questionable rationale and no empirical evidence. Other treatments (for example, prism lenses, physical exercise, and auditory integration training) have had studies with small positive outcomes, but few conclusions can be made about them due to methodological problems with the studies.        In its overall review of the treatment effectiveness literature, AETNA concluded that "The effectiveness of these therapies is unproven." , while the American Academy of Pediatrics concluded that "parents should be informed that the amount of research regarding the effectiveness of sensory integration therapy is limited and inconclusive."  A 2015 review concluded that SIT techniques exist "outside the bounds of established evidence-based practice" and that SIT is "quite possibly a misuse of limited resources."   Sensory processing issues represent a feature of a number of disorders, including anxiety problems, ADHD,  food intolerances, behavioral disorders, and particularly, autism spectrum disorders       .  This pattern of comorbidities poses a significant challenge to those who claim that SPD is a identifiably specific disorder, rather than simply a term given to a set of symptoms common to other disorders  .  Dr. Catherine Lord, a leading autism expert and the director of the Center for Autism and the Developing Brain at New York-Presbyterian Hospital, argues that sensory issues are an important concern, but not a diagnosis in themselves. “I do think there’s a value in attending to how a child is perceiving sensations, thinking about whether he could be uncomfortable. Where I get concerned is labeling that as a separate disorder.”  Two studies have provided preliminary evidence suggesting that there may be measurable neurological differences between children diagnosed with SPD and control children classified as neurotypical   or children diagnosed with autism  .  Despite this evidence, the fact that SPD researchers have yet to agree on a proven, standardized diagnostic tool undermines researchers’ ability to define the boundaries of the disease and makes correlational studies, like the ones about structural brain abnormalities, less convincing  . The American Occupational Therapy Association (AOTA) supports the use of a variety of methods of sensory integration for those with sensory processing disorder. The organization has supported the need for further research to increase insurance coverage for related therapies. They have also made efforts to educate the public about sensory integration therapy. The AOTA's practice guidelines currently support the use of sensory integration therapy and interprofessional education and collaboration in order to optimize treatment for those with sensory processing disorder. The AOTA provides several resources pertaining to sensory integration therapy, some of which includes a fact sheet, new research, and continuing education opportunities.
