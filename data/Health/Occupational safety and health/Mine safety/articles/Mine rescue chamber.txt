A mine rescue chamber is an emergency shelter installed in underground environments. The rescue chambers in a typical coal mine provide 4 days of air, food and water for up to 15 people. Communication equipment is also available. The chambers are required to be located in close proximity to worker areas.  EMERGENCY SHELTERS: SEC. 315. The Secretary or an authorized representative of the Secretary may prescribe in any coal mine that rescue chambers, properly sealed and ventilated, be erected at suitable locations in the mine to which persons may go in case of an emergency for protection against hazards. Such chambers shall be properly equipped with first aid materials, an adequate supply of air and self-contained breathing equipment, an independent communication system to the surface, and proper accommodations for the persons while awaiting rescue, and such other equipment as the Secretary may require. A plan for the erection, maintenance, and revisions of such chambers and the training of the miners in their proper use shall be submitted by the operator to the Secretary for his approval.
