There is uncertainty about his educational background, although he was highly articulate in both German and English. As a teenager he became a seaman.  Aged 19, he sailed into <a href=\"/wiki/Melbourne\" title=\"Melbourne\">Melbourne</a>, on 20 December 1855 aboard the Chilean brig <i>Pedro V</i> from <a href=\"/wiki/Valparaiso\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Valparaiso\">Valparaiso</a> via <a href=\"/wiki/Tahiti\" title=\"Tahiti\">Tahiti</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Gold_miner_.28and_the_Henry_Lawson_connection.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Gold_miner_(and_the_Henry_Lawson_connection)\">Gold miner (and the Henry Lawson connection)</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=William_Henry_John_Slee&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Gold miner (and the Henry Lawson connection)\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Along with a Norwegian shipmate, Neils Hertzberg Larsen, who Anglicised his name to Peter Lawson, he left ship there, attracted to the <a href=\"/wiki/Ballarat,_Victoria\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Ballarat, Victoria\">Ballarat</a> gold rush.  The two partners led a knockabout miners' life over the next decade, lured around to new goldfields, but without much result.\n</p><p>Eventually Slee and Lawson made their way to NSW, mining first at Lambing Flat, then at New Pipeclay (now Eurunderee, <a href=\"/wiki/New_South_Wales\" title=\"New South Wales\">New South Wales</a>).  In 1866 Lawson married there, his first son, <a href=\"/wiki/Henry_Lawson\" title=\"Henry Lawson\">Henry Lawson</a>, novelist and poet, being born the following year at <a href=\"/wiki/Grenfell,_New_South_Wales\" title=\"Grenfell, New South Wales\">Grenfell</a>.  Slee had earlier moved on to the new goldfield at Grenfell, writing Lawson to join him, where their quartz reef mining claim, named 'The Result', was also unrewarding.  In 1869 Slee married at Grenfell to Emma Nelson, daughter of John Luke Gore and Mary Ann Nelson, of English and Irish origin.\n</p><p>W.H.J. Slee first came to public notice during his years at Grenfell.  In 1870 he was active in agitations to promote mining development by obtaining government rewards for discoverers of new goldfields.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> He became so favourably well known that in September 1872 he was appointed manager of a goldmine at Emu Creek. With that, the partnership between Slee and Lawson was dissolved.  In 1873 the Lawson family returned to Pipeclay, while the Slee family remained in Grenfell.  Four children were born into the Slee family between 1870 and 1876, one of which died in 1873.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Appointed_first_Inspector_of_Mines_for_NSW\">Appointed first Inspector of Mines for NSW</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=William_Henry_John_Slee&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Appointed first Inspector of Mines for NSW\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Government inspection of coal mining in NSW had commenced in 1854, but other mining activity had been mostly unregulated. Large numbers of inexperienced people flocked to the gold diggings to try their luck, many using mining methods which were unsafe or impractical. The increased mining activity and a general dissatisfaction with the administration of mining led to the <i>Mining Act, 1874</i> and the establishment of the Department of Mines on 1 May 1874.  That same date, W.H.J. Slee was appointed the first Inspector of Mines for NSW, being responsible for <a href=\"/wiki/Industrial_safety\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Industrial safety\">industrial safety</a> and enforcing mining safety codes.\n</p><p>For the next 14 years Slee was the only officer in the department filling that position.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> In 1876 Slee reported, \"The [mining] regulations ensure safety to the health and life of the working miner; they strengthen the hands of the mining manager against the false economy of the directors; they protect the shareholder, in having his mine kept in a secure state for future development; and they compel tributers to keep the mine under their charge in a secure and workable state.\"\n</p><p>W.H.J. Slee approached the task by adroitly balancing the competing perspectives of mine managers, investors, and practical miners.  Active in the field, on the surface and underground, he visited mining operations all about NSW, producing individual geological reports and annual mining activity reports of such value that they were reproduced in newspapers as a matter of course.  As part of this role he proclaimed and named new mining fields.  Apart from assessing mining prospects, he adjudicated in disputes and investigated mining accidents and disasters.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Field_operations_as_mining_warden\">Field operations as mining warden</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=William_Henry_John_Slee&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Field operations as mining warden\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Slee used the gold mining town of <a href=\"/wiki/Hill_End,_New_South_Wales\" title=\"Hill End, New South Wales\">Hill End</a> as his headquarters in 1880, his annual report revealing that in one year alone he had travelled more than 6,000 miles (9,600&#160;km) by horse and buggy throughout New South Wales and had inspected 52 <a href=\"/wiki/Tin\" title=\"Tin\">tin</a> mines, eight copper mines, and 197 quartz and 116 alluvial gold mines.\n</p><p>When in 1880 the <a href=\"/wiki/Milparinka,_New_South_Wales\" title=\"Milparinka, New South Wales\">Milparinka</a>, Mount Browne, and <a href=\"/wiki/Tibooburra,_New_South_Wales\" title=\"Tibooburra, New South Wales\">Tibooburra</a> goldfields, known as the <a href=\"/wiki/Albert_Goldfield\" title=\"Albert Goldfield\">Albert Goldfield</a>, opened up in remote western NSW, he was appointed Goldfields Warden and Mines Inspector, spending several years there, appointing assistant warden's clerks to the new mines at <a href=\"/wiki/Silverton,_New_South_Wales\" title=\"Silverton, New South Wales\">Silverton</a> region, at the conclusion of which the people of these districts subscribed to present him with a gold watch and address in appreciation of his services.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> The <a href=\"/wiki/Linnean_Society\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Linnean Society\">Linnean Society</a> of NSW published his observations on <a href=\"/wiki/Australian_Aborigines\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Australian Aborigines\">Aboriginal</a> customs in that region.\n</p><p>With increased use of diamond drills for <a href=\"/wiki/Mineral_exploration\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Mineral exploration\">mineral exploration</a> and sourcing <a href=\"/wiki/Artesian_water\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Artesian water\">artesian water</a>, he gained such expertise that in 1885 he was also appointed NSW Superintendent of Diamond Drills, a program that under his guidance made valuable developments, particularly as to engineering and public health.
