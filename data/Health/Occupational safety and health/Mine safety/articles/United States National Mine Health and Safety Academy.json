As a result, the Bureau of Mines was established by Congress on July 1, 1910, \"to make diligent investigation of the methods of mining, especially in relation to the safety of miners and the appliances best adapted to prevent accidents.\"\n</p><p>In succeeding years, Congress passed other legislation designed to promote health and safety in the mines, including the 1966 Federal Metal and Nonmetallic Mine Safety Act (P.L. 89-577) and the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969 (P.L. 91-173). The most recent regulatory legislation combined the coal and metal and nonmetal industries under one law--the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. This act directed that \"The National Mine Health and Safety Academy shall be...responsible for the training of mine safety and health inspectors, mining personnel, or other persons as the Secretaries of Labor and Interior shall designate. In performing this function, the Academy shall have the authority to enter into cooperative educational and training agreements with educational institutions, State governments, labor organizations, and mine operators and related industries.\" It is through the training provisions of this legislation that the National Mine Health and Safety Academy functions.  \n</p><p>In response to the mandates of the Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, on September 7, 1971, the Academy began inspector training in temporary facilities in Beckley, West Virginia. On August 17, 1976, the permanent facility, situated on 80 acres (320,000&#160;m<sup>2</sup>) of land donated by the Raleigh County Airport Authority, opened its doors with an official dedication.  <a href=\"/wiki/Michael_George_Zabetakis\" title=\"Michael George Zabetakis\">Michael George Zabetakis</a> was the first superintendent of the Academy.\n</p><p>On July 25, 1979, Public Law 96-38 transferred the activities and functions of the National Mine Health and Safety Academy from the Department of the Interior to the Department of Labor.  \n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"External_links\">External links</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=United_States_National_Mine_Health_and_Safety_Academy&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: External links\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.msha.gov/PROGRAMS/EPD2.HTM\">National Mine Health and Safety Academy Homepage</a></li></ul>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw2241\nCached time: 20180914092102\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.060 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.071 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 33/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 146/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 3/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\nLua time usage: 0.027/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 1.64 MB/50 MB\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   54.841      1 -total\n 99.76%   54.711      2 Template:Convert\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:4514633-0!canonical and timestamp 20180914092102 and revision id 740228847\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","*":"Mining_law_and_governance"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Mine_safety"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Beckley, West Virginia"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Michael George Zabetakis"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Mine Safety and Health Administration"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Raleigh County Airport"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"United States federal academies"}],"templates":[{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Convert"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Convert"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Convert/data"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Convert/text"}],"images":["Nmhsa.gif"],"externallinks":["http://www.msha.gov/PROGRAMS/EPD2.HTM"],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"History","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"United_States_National_Mine_Health_and_Safety_Academy","byteoffset":1066,"anchor":"History"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"External links","number":"2","index":"2","fromtitle":"United_States_National_Mine_Health_and_Safety_Academy","byteoffset":3049,"anchor":"External_links"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"United States National Mine Health and Safety Academy","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q7890781"}]}}
