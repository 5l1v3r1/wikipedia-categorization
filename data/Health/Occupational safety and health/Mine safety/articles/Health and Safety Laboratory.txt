The Health and Safety Laboratory, also known as the HSE Laboratory or HSL Buxton, is a large 550-acre research site in rural High Peak, Derbyshire, south of Buxton. It started out as the Safety in Mines Research Establishment (SMRE) in 1947.  The Safety in Mines Research Board had been formed in 1921, and it bought the site in Harpur Hill in 1924. It researched work into safety of mining. Other research laboratories for mining safety had been opened in 1928 in Sheffield. At the SMRE in 1956, Herbert Eisner discovered how high-expansion foam can put out fires. The Occupational Medicine Laboratory opened in London in 1959, and this merged with the site in Derbyshire to form the HSE's Research and Laboratory Services Division (RLSD). All of the laboratories became the Health and Safety Laboratory in 1995. It is sited near Harpur Hill, west of the A515.  It researches new methods in industrial safety. It provides training courses in subjects such as COMAH and DSEAR. Coordinates: 53°13′50″N 1°55′05″W﻿ / ﻿53.23042°N 1.91808°W﻿ / 53.23042; -1.91808
