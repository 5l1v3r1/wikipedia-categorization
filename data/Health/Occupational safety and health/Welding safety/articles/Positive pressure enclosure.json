They are used most often in conjunction with the need for <a href=\"/wiki/Welding\" title=\"Welding\">welding</a>, and are often associated with the <a href=\"/wiki/Offshore_drilling\" title=\"Offshore drilling\">offshore oil industry</a>.\n</p><p>A positive pressure enclosure works by providing a constant inflow of breathable atmosphere, which in turn causes gas to continuously leak out of the chamber.  This outflow of gases prevents the ingress of explosive gases or vapours which are often present in such work locations.  This constant outflow of gases from the chamber also serves to cleanse the air within of the undesirable gaseous by-products of the welding process.  Most commercial versions of positive pressure enclosures are referred to by their manufacturers as <i>habitats</i>.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Standards_.26_Certification\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Standards_&amp;_Certification\">Standards &amp; Certification</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Positive_pressure_enclosure&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Standards &amp; Certification\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"IEC_Standard\">IEC Standard</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Positive_pressure_enclosure&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: IEC Standard\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Almost all developed countries are members of the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). Positive pressure enclosures, or \u201cwelding habitats\u201d are working on the principle of overpressure.

The IEC60079-13 standard forms the bases of welding habitat certification to the ATEX directive 2014/34/EU (mandatory for Europe), and the IECEx equipment certification scheme. The IEC60079-13 standard is adopted into national certification standards by changing the prefix to the applicable national prefix i.e. IEC60079-13 becomes BS EN 60079-13 (UK), or CAN/CSA C22.2 No 60079-13 (Canada), ANSI/UL 60079-13 (USA) etc. There may be some national foreword added to the IEC60079 series standard, but the main content of these national version of the IEC standards are identical to the IEC standard.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"ATEX_Certification\">ATEX Certification</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Positive_pressure_enclosure&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: ATEX Certification\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>ATEX certification is the national certification standard of the European Union, and mandatory to operate equipment in explosive atmosphere in Europe.

Under the ATEX 2014/34/EU Directive, all equipment requires a proper manufacturer's EU Declaration of Conformity.

Practically the same as trying to convince someone about the roadworthiness of a car, by providing the certification for the tyres, lights, engine, etc., instead of the certificate for the car.\n</p><p>Welding habitat certification is not about the individual component compliance \u2013 that\u2019s a given \u2013 it is about what the habitat as a system does: completely separating potential explosive atmosphere from hot work using a controlled overpressure system combined with an automatic shutdown unit certified to IEC60079-13.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"IECEx_Certification\">IECEx Certification</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Positive_pressure_enclosure&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: IECEx Certification\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The IECEx certification scheme is regulated by the IECEx 02 <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.iecex.com/docs/iecex02_ed6.0.pdf\"><i>IEC System for Certification to Standards relating to Equipment for use in Explosive Atmospheres (IECEx System)</i></a>\n</p><p>IECEx certification is more transparent than ATEX, as all certification is web-based and can be checked &amp; downloaded on the <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://iecex.iec.ch/iecex/exs.nsf/ex_eq.xsp?v=e\">IECEx certification website</a>.

Habitats are constructed from flame retardant materials. The overpressure prevents flammable gas from reaching hot work (e.g. welding) inside the habitat and igniting. With an associated control and shutdown system, a habitat is able to ensure the safe execution of hot work in classified areas under normal operating and production conditions. Conditions in unclassified areas may also make it necessary to use a habitat.\nThis recommendation assumes that a risk assessment has already been carried out, including an assessment of alternative methods (cold work, shutdown, etc.), and it has been decided that a habitat shall be used.\n</p><p><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\"
