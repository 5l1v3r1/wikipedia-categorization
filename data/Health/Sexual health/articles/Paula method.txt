The Paula Method is a proposed alternative to Kegel exercises.  The idea is that by strengthening your sphincter muscles (eye muscle: orbicularis oculi and mouth muscle: orbicularis oris), the contractions would also strengthen the sphincter muscles in the pelvic floor.  Evidence to support its use is lacking.
