Spermatorrhea is a condition of excessive, involuntary ejaculation. It is a recognized disorder in traditional Chinese medicine, in which certain patterns of involuntary ejaculation reflect problems with kidney qi.   In Ayurvedic Medicine, Ashwagandha and Bala are used to treat this vata ailment.  In the 18th and 19th centuries, if a patient had ejaculations outside of marital intercourse, or released more semen than is typical, then he was diagnosed with a disease called spermatorrhea or "seminal weakness". A variety of drugs and other treatments, including circumcision and castration, were advised as treatment.    Some alternative practitioners, especially herb healers, continue to diagnose and advise treatments for cases of spermatorrhea.  In Western medicine during the nineteenth century, spermatorrhea was regarded as a medical disorder with corrupting and devastating effects on the mind and body.  The cure for spermatorrhea was regarded as enforced chastity and avoidance of masturbation, with circumcision sometimes being used as a treatment.    According to modern Western medicine, ejaculation is a normal process, and some even see it as a normal part of daily life, and incapable of causing ill effects, other than temporary tiredness and reduction of sexual desire in the individual concerned. In contrast, Traditional Chinese Medicine counts the production of semen as one of the biggest strains on jing (kidney essence).
