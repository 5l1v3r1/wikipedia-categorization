In ancient times, women attempted to protect themselves from unwanted pregnancy with various means and practices, as evidenced by ancient records. Ancient and medieval manuscripts provide glimpses into diverse birth control practices. The story of ancient oral contraceptives must be woven from threads of the past, not only by writers on medieval medicine but also by legend and lore, art and the works of ancient poets, playwrights and philosophers.\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Spermicidal\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Spermicidal</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Plant_Based_Oral_Contraceptives\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Plant Based Oral Contraceptives</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Physical_Contraceptive_Barriers\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Physical Contraceptive Barriers</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Behaviors\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Behaviors</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Coitus_interruptus\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Coitus interruptus</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#The_Catholic_Church\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">The Catholic Church</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#See_also\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">See also</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Spermicidal\">Spermicidal</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Medieval_contraception&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Spermicidal\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>As the first official record of contraception, an Egyptian spermicidal recipe from the period around 1525 BC was to \"mix grated Acacia leaves and honey and soak a gauze bandage to be inserted into the vagina.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> This type of contraceptive tampon could have had a spermicidal effect due to the acacia lactic acid contained in the sap which is proven effective as a spermicide.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Plant_Based_Oral_Contraceptives\">Plant Based Oral Contraceptives</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Medieval_contraception&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Plant Based Oral Contraceptives\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Most of the indigenous peoples around the world, as well as from European antiquity all the way to the <a href=\"/wiki/Middle_Ages\" title=\"Middle Ages\">Middle Ages</a> contain linkages to point to the use of plant based oral contraceptives.

This plant was one example of an oral contraceptive in ancient times, based partly on Pliny's statement that it could be used \"to promote the menstrual discharge\" <sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> but since then has been harvested into extinction.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Physical_Contraceptive_Barriers\">Physical Contraceptive Barriers</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Medieval_contraception&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Physical Contraceptive Barriers\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The ancient philosopher, <a href=\"/wiki/Aristotle\" title=\"Aristotle\">Aristotle</a>, wrote in The History of Animals VII, part 3 (350 B.C.E), that to avoid conception, women must prevent the \"womb\" from coming in contact with the male sperm by rubbing it with cedar oil, lead ointment or incense, mixed with olive oil. The lead ointment was highly toxic, but the oil was proven to decreased sperm mobility by <a href=\"/wiki/Marie_Stopes\" title=\"Marie Stopes\">Marie Stopes</a> in the 1930s. \n300 AD marked the introduction of the <a href=\"/wiki/Contraceptive_sponge\" title=\"Contraceptive sponge\">Contraceptive sponge</a> which was inserted into the vagina, so as to prevent conception by absorbing the semen. An Indian prevention recipe from the 8th Century has survived throughout time. The cervical opening was brushed with a mixture of honey and ghee and is then rubbed or mixed with oil rock salt and used to physically block semen. The sticky honey likely reduced sperm motility, and rock salt is now regarded as a spermicide. The works of Iranian author Ibn Sina (980-1037), also known as <a href=\"/wiki/Avicenna\" title=\"Avicenna\">Avicenna</a>, has shown to have had 20 different contraceptives in his medical encyclopedia.\n</p><p>Around 300 AD  thimbles were commonly used as a primitive contraception. People thought them highly effective, yet they achieved very little.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources.

These methods could have been used either out of personal preference, or with heavy influence from religion. Likely the most common used and easiest to hide from the church at the time was coitus interruptus.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Coitus_interruptus\">Coitus interruptus</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Medieval_contraception&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Coitus interruptus\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/Coitus_interruptus\" title=\"Coitus interruptus\">Coitus interruptus</a> is an example of a contraceptive behavior utilized in Medieval times. This is the case with Onanism, which is clearly distinguished from masturbation. In the biblical telling, Onan was unwilling to procreate with Tamar, so he withdrew before climax and \u201cspilled his seed on the ground\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> Masturbation is seen as a form of self arousal, while onanism was viewed as a form of contraception. U.S. Senator, <a href=\"/wiki/John_T._Noonan\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"John T. Noonan\">John T. Noonan</a>, has written extensively on this topic and believed that the first certain dated reference to Onanism appeared in the ninth century.<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> The beginning, practices of coitus interruptus has been linked to circles of prostitution and illicit love affairs within the Middle Ages.<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> From there, it took the decisive step towards widespread practice and began entering into conventional sexual relationships, such as marriage. The trigger of this development - assuming other mental and moral conditions - was provided by economic hardship.<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> Population control was not a brand new topic during the time. \"If too many children are being born,\" stated the ancient Greek philosopher Plato, writing of the ideal city, \"there are measures to check propagation.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> Medieval demography has been linked to the church's teaching on birth control. Demographic statistics of the early fifteenth century provide evidence that married couples were limiting the number of offspring they had, likely with such methods as Coitus interruptus. This was particularly true with poor couples and in periods of economic hardship.<sup id=\"cite_ref-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup> The purposeful prevention of pregnancy is brought into juxtaposition with the churches moralist denunciation of contraception.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Catholic_Church\">The Catholic Church</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Medieval_contraception&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: The Catholic Church\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Birth was viewed in an entirely different light during the Middle Ages from what it does now among the nations of Europe and America. Historically, the <a href=\"/wiki/Catholic_Church\" title=\"Catholic Church\">Catholic Church</a> perpetuated a belief that conception was an act of God and that abstinence from marriage was the only recourse from sterility. While abortion is relatively prevalent today, birth control measures are sufficiently well known to be effective. The Church frowned upon contraceptive use or any methods of impeding population growth. The purpose of matrimony was stated to be the procreation of children, while purposelessly entering into an intentionally childless marriage was considered as little short of prostitution.<sup id=\"cite_ref-14\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup> One area to address is <a href=\"/wiki/Pope_Gregory_IX\" title=\"Pope Gregory IX\">Pope Gregory IX</a>, and his <a href=\"/wiki/Decretal\" title=\"Decretal\">Decretal</a> dating from between 1227 and 1234 which declared that marriages contracted by parties intending to avoid having offspring were \u2019\u2019ipso facto\u2019\u2019 or null.<sup id=\"cite_ref-15\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup> The open opposition the church held towards the use of contraception was likely led many individuals to use <a href=\"/wiki/Sexual_abstinence\" title=\"Sexual abstinence\">Sexual abstinence</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Medieval_contraception&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/History_of_birth_control\" title=\"History of birth control\">History of birth control</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Medieval_contraception&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap mw-references-columns\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Birgit Seyr: prevent with plants.
