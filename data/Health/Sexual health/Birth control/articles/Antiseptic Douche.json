For instance, the packaging of birth control products could not say, \u201cto prevent pregnancy,\u201d but could say to, \u201cmanage feminine health.\u201d  However, women knew that managing feminine health meant pregnancy prevention, and these products flew off the shelves.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>   As a result of this strategic advertising, an entirely new space in the consumer market was created for birth control products practically overnight.

The Antiseptic Douche, in fact, had one of the lowest success rates, somewhere around 20-30%.  The majority of women who used the douche often found themselves pregnant in the long run.<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>   However, regardless of the high failure rate, demand was high. Because the products could not be advertised as birth control products, the companies were not responsible to communicate the success rate or the health risks associated with using an antiseptic douche.  \u201cClamoring for a larger share of the hygiene market, manufactures did their utmost to ensure their product would be one women would want to try.\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>  Later research actually shows that douching can lead to pregnancy, in that the solution can push the sperm farther up into the body and into the <a href=\"/wiki/Cervix\" title=\"Cervix\">Cervix</a>, or in most cases do nothing because even when used correctly and immediately after sexual intercourse, the sperm has already reached the egg.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Health_risks\">Health risks</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Antiseptic_Douche&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Health risks\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Modern research shows douching is very unhealthy for a woman\u2019s hygiene.

Many women felt that the stronger the mixture, the more likely it would be to prevent pregnancy, which increased the health risks. In addition to Mercury, there were various other chemicals being used as birth control, and these different solutions could result in burns to a woman\u2019s vagina, <a href=\"/wiki/Ectopic_pregnancy\" title=\"Ectopic pregnancy\">Ectopic pregnancies</a>, and other serious effects that could potentially lead to hospitalization.<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>  \n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Decline_in_use_of_antiseptic_douching\">Decline in use of antiseptic douching</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Antiseptic_Douche&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Decline in use of antiseptic douching\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>With the repeal of the Comstock Act, the continued championing of Margaret Sanger, and the development of more reliable forms of birth control, the use of the Antiseptic Douche began to decline.
