A GnRH modulator, or GnRH receptor modulator, is a type of medication which modulates the GnRH receptor, the biological target of the hypothalamic hormone gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH).   They include GnRH agonists and GnRH antagonists. These medications may be GnRH analogues like leuprorelin and cetrorelix – peptides that are structurally related to GnRH – or small-molecules like elagolix, which are structurally distinct from GnRH analogues. GnRH modulators affect the secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which in turn affects the gonads, influencing their function and hence fertility as well as the production of sex steroids, including that of estradiol and progesterone in women and of testosterone in men. As such, GnRH modulators can also be described as progonadotropic or antigonadotropic, depending on whether they act to increase or decrease gonadotropins. a = Under development; not yet marketed.
