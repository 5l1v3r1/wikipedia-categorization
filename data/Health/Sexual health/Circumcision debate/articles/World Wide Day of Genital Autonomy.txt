The World Wide Day of Genital Autonomy (WWDOGA) is a campaign day to oppose circumcision of infants initiated by the German "Facharbeitskreis Beschneidungsbetroffener im MOGiS e.V.". Since 2013, it is celebrated on each 7 May in many countries and regarded by the press.           This date has been chosen because on May 7, 2012, the District Court of Cologne (Germany) has judged for the first time in Germany, that the circumcision of male children is an assault.
