Foreskin Man is a comic book superhero created by Matthew Hess to protest against circumcision. Foreskin Man's alter ego is Miles Hastwick, a former corporate scientist now curator of the Museum of Genital Integrity.  He is adamantly against the practice of circumcision. In the first issue, Hastwick comes up with the alter ego of Foreskin Man to fight against practitioners of circumcision and "the pro-circumcision lobby," whom he feels have gained too much power through "all of the well connected doctors and lawyers."  In the third issue of the comic, he teams up with a female heroine, dubbed "Vulva Girl," who fights to oppose female genital mutilation. Together, they travel to Kenya to stop tribal circumcisions.    In the fourth issue, he travels to Turkey to prevent the teenage son of a   belly dancer from receiving an Islamic circumcision.   The fifth issue shows him battling against the head of a company that collects foreskins for use in cosmetics and, in the sixth issue, he goes to the Philippines to disrupt Operation Tuli.   The second issue of Foreskin Man, in which the hero fights against a villain named Monster Mohel drew criticism from the Anti-Defamation League. Nancy Appel, the ADL's associate director, was quoted as saying,  "The (Monster) mohel has a dark complexion, hook nose and is practically drooling at the thought of apparently doing harm to a child, he even has claws on his fingertips. He is blood thirsty just like the grotesque Jewish stereotypes that appeared in Nazi propaganda. It's absolutely a direct parallel."
