Walsall Integrated Sexual Health Services (WiSH) is a part of the UK National Health Service that provides sexual healthcare in the Walsall area of the UK. The services include the treatment and prevention of sexually transmitted infections, contraception and participation in the National Chlamydia Screening Programme.  All services are free and confidential and are available to UK and European Community nationals regardless of age.  Since 1 April 2013, Walsall Council (the Local Authority) has been responsible for commissioning the service as part of their public health responsibilities. The funding comes from their allocated public health grant from the UK government.  The service operates from clinics in central Walsall – The Centre for Sexual Health at Walsall Manor Hospital and WiSH in Navigation Street – and at Willenhall Health Centre, Pinfold Health Centre, Beechdale Health Centre and Darlaston Health Centre.
