 Mycoplasma hominis is a species of bacteria in the genus Mycoplasma. M. hominis has the ability to penetrate the interior of human cells.  Along with ureaplasmas, mycoplasmas are the smallest free-living organisms known. They have no cell wall and therefore do not Gram stain. M. hominis  is associated with pelvic inflammatory disease   and bacterial vaginosis.  It is also associated with male infertility.  This species causes a sexually transmitted disease.  It is susceptible to the antibiotic clindamycin.  Growth of "fried egg" colonies on glucose agar medium within 24â€“48 hours is a characteristic of Mycoplasma hominis. DNA sequence data is incomplete for M. hominis. M. hominis uses an atypical type of energy metabolism, dependent upon the degradation of arginine. Other mycoplasmas lack this characteristic. Determining the genome will provide information that would facilitate the understanding of metabolic reconstitutions.
