Refusal skills are a set of skills designed to help children avoid participating in high-risk behaviors.  Programs designed to discourage crime, drug use, violence, and/or sexual activity frequently include refusal skills in their curricula to help students resist peer pressure while maintaining self-respect.  One such program is Drug Abuse Resistance Education.  Programs may focus on: offering alternative activities, saying "no", being honest, and using humor.
