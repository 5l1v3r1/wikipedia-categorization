Purity rings (also known as promise rings, abstinence rings, or chastity rings) are worn as a sign of chastity.  The practice originated in the United States in the 1990s among Christian-affiliated sexual abstinence groups.   Wearing a purity ring is typically accompanied by a religious vow to practice abstinence until marriage.  Chastity rings are part of the abstinence-only sex education movement and also are intended to help the wearer to recognize their self-worth and remind them that there is more to a relationship than sex.   David Bario of the Columbia News Service wrote: Under the Bush administration, organizations that promote abstinence and encourage teens to sign virginity pledges or wear purity rings have received federal grants. The Silver Ring Thing, a subsidiary of a Pennsylvania evangelical church, has received more than $1 million from the government to promote abstinence and to sell its rings in the United States and abroad. In 2005 the ACLU of Massachusetts brought charges against this decision, alleging that the Silver Ring program did not ensure its secularity and hence was ineligible for federal funding due to the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.  Many celebrities, including Miley Cyrus, Selena Gomez, Jessica Simpson, and the Jonas Brothers, have worn purity rings.
