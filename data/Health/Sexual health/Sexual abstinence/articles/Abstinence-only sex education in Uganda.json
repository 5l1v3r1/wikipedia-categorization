id=\"cite_ref-Stoneburner2004_2-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Stoneburner2004-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> many programs were introduced to lower incidence of HIV and educate about the disease. <a href=\"/wiki/Abstinence-only_sex_education\" title=\"Abstinence-only sex education\">Abstinence-only sex education</a> was implemented as one way to quell the spread of HIV/AIDS, in addition to creating a positive behaviour change to the same end over time.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Stoneburner2004_2-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Stoneburner2004-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> As the epidemic became known on the international scene, money and resources from many nations flooded Africa in general and Uganda in particular. Abstinence-only sex education in Uganda in the late 1990s onward was largely financed by the United States and independent faith-based organizations <sup id=\"cite_ref-HRW2003_1-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-HRW2003-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Programs\">Programs</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Abstinence-only_sex_education_in_Uganda&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Programs\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Abstinence.2C_Be_faithful.2C_use_a_Condom_.28ABC.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Abstinence,_Be_faithful,_use_a_Condom_(ABC)\">Abstinence, Be faithful, use a Condom (ABC)</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Abstinence-only_sex_education_in_Uganda&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Abstinence, Be faithful, use a Condom (ABC)\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The ABC approach was introduced during the US-Ugandan efforts to propose Abstinence-only as a way to lower HIV transmission.  ABC is an acronym, A being <a href=\"/wiki/Abstinence\" title=\"Abstinence\">Abstinence</a>, B being <a href=\"/wiki/Monogamy\" title=\"Monogamy\">Be Faithful</a>, and C being <a href=\"/wiki/Condom\" title=\"Condom\">Condom</a> use.<sup id=\"cite_ref-HRW2003_1-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-HRW2003-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> It would seem that this form of abstinence-only includes some education and encouragement of condoms, but the application of ABC is disaggregated for specific populations. The breakdown is Abstinence for people not yet married, Be Faithful for those in marriages, and Condom Use only for people that are already infected or are in a marriage where one person is infected.<sup id=\"cite_ref-HRW2003_1-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-HRW2003-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>ABC has evolved since its inception to a program known as AB, released in 2004 as an official abstinence-only education program for Uganda specifically. AB has lessened the emphasis on condoms due to the confusing nature of teaching the two simultaneously and the fear that condoms undermine the message of abstinence.<sup id=\"cite_ref-HRW2003_1-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-HRW2003-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>  AB is criticized for its lack of follow-through of collecting data on whether participants are abstaining or not.<sup id=\"cite_ref-HRW2003_1-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-HRW2003-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> The main source of data collected for AB is the number of AB rallies, organizations and discussions concerning AB, instead of the behavioural changes proposed by AB. Therefore, AB is difficult to monitor as the true success of the programs aims for abstinence and social modifications, but no data is kept.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Condoms.2C_Needles.2C_and_Negotiation_.28CNN.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Condoms,_Needles,_and_Negotiation_(CNN)\">Condoms, Needles, and Negotiation (CNN)</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Abstinence-only_sex_education_in_Uganda&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Condoms, Needles, and Negotiation (CNN)\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Condoms, Needles and Negotiations was born out of the necessity of failing marital <a href=\"/wiki/Monogamy\" title=\"Monogamy\">monogamy</a>.

In this way, AB abstinence-only education falls short for protecting the lives of those practicing it. The Condoms part of CNN is two-fold to reduce condom stigma and promote use within the B (Be Faithful) section of AB.  Women are still practicing faithfulness, but in order to protect their health, they still need to be able to understand and use condoms. The next N in CNN covers needle exchange, which doesn't relate to abstinence-only sex education.  But the third N stands for Negotiation, which again plays a part for individuals practicing faithfulness who could still be harmed.  Negotiation informs partners of the risks they might encounter if their partner is not being monogamous and teaches them skills to bargain in their position in the relationship.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Presidential_Initiative_on_AIDS_Strategy_for_Communication_to_Youth_.28PIASCY.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Presidential_Initiative_on_AIDS_Strategy_for_Communication_to_Youth_(PIASCY)\">Presidential Initiative on AIDS Strategy for Communication to Youth (PIASCY)</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Abstinence-only_sex_education_in_Uganda&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Presidential Initiative on AIDS Strategy for Communication to Youth (PIASCY)\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In 2001, Ugandan President <a href=\"/wiki/Yoweri_Museveni\" title=\"Yoweri Museveni\">Yoweri Museveni</a> introduced his official program for sex education for the youth of Uganda, Presidential Initiative on AIDS Strategy for Communication to Youth, abbreviated as PIASCY. PIASCY mainly targets primary schools, secondary schools and after school youth rallies with materials and instruction (HRW, 29). The main focus of PIASCY is for young people to empower themselves to delay their sexual relations until marriage through abstinence. PIASCY is primarily funded through the <a href=\"/wiki/United_States_Agency_for_International_Development\" title=\"United States Agency for International Development\">United States Agency for International Development</a> and the <a href=\"/wiki/U.S._Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\">U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>, both of which provide many other services outside of finances to support the program.

Between the years of 1989 and 1995, Uganda saw large success with the employment of abstinence and subsequent HIV infection rates comparatively to their regional neighbours. In males aged 15\u201324 years old, there was a decrease from 60% to 23% participation in premarital sex.  Similarly, females aged 15\u201325 saw a decrease from 53% to 16% in 1989 and 1995 respectively.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Stoneburner2004_2-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Stoneburner2004-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> This decrease coincided with a policy called zero-grazing, which emphasizes monogamous relationships and the faithfulness that is implied.  Curiously, there were very few abstinence-only education programs in place during this decrease, despite the choice of abstinence from sexual intercourse having a significant decline.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Stoneburner2004_2-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Stoneburner2004-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Abstinence-only sex education leaves women socially vulnerable.<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> Women in Uganda have a diminished ability to hold dominion over their bodies.  Young women are often coerced into relationships with older men, teachers, or \"sugar daddies\" that provide them with items that would not be accessible otherwise.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Schoepf2003_8-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Schoepf2003-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>  Biologically speaking, if women or men break their abstinence vow, a woman is twice as likely to contract HIV due to her anatomy. Furthermore, abstinence only sex education doesn't teach ways to avoid HIV/AIDS infection after marriage.\n</p><p>In Uganda, married women are one of the highest at risk populations.  One of the biggest concerns is extra-marital sex that brings HIV into a <a href=\"/wiki/Seronegative\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Seronegative\">seronegative</a> relationship, in fact, in Uganda, men are twice as likely to infect their wives in marriage after entering into the relationship as seronegative.  In addition, men are less likely to communicate the fact that they are infected with HIV to their partners.  For example, of men that are hospitalized for HIV/AIDS, only 12% of the wives knew of their husbands' infection.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Schoepf2003_8-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Schoepf2003-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>  When seronegative women engage in sexual intercourse with seropositive men, they are twice as likely to contract HIV than men in the same situation.  In this respect, abstinence-only sex education neglects protecting anyone that does participate in sexual acts, and especially women, due to the gender power relations in Uganda.\n</p><p>In abstinence-only sex education, there is not a program within to plan for pregnancy or control birth spacing. As the only tenant is to abstain from sexual relations until marriage, once in marriage this feature is not utilized. In Uganda, there are strict tradition surrounding sex post-partum and while <a href=\"/wiki/Breastfeeding\" title=\"Breastfeeding\">breastfeeding</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-van1988_10-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-van1988-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> Postpartum abstinence is a widely held belief and generally practiced.  Unfortunately, this often leads to extramarital intercourse.  In monogamous relationships, 31% of husbands abstain completely.  This remaining 69% look elsewhere for sex, through polygamous relations, sex workers, or casual relationships.<sup id=\"cite_ref-van1988_10-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-van1988-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> This abstinent period is not effective in the realm of preventing HIV from entering a seronegative relationship. In addition, in relationships that don't observe the post-partum abstinence, birth spacing becomes non-existent.  In this case, many women find themselves pregnant in quick succession.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Controversy\">Controversy</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Abstinence-only_sex_education_in_Uganda&amp;action=edit&amp;section=14\" title=\"Edit section: Controversy\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Abstinence-only sex education became quite controversial in the examination of HIV/AIDS and pregnancy prevention due to the common link with morals and proselytizing. Often, abstinence-only sex education is taught from a Christian perspective and creates a connection with <a href=\"/wiki/Virginity\" title=\"Virginity\">virginity</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Self-worth\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Self-worth\">self-worth</a>. In many cases, if someone slips from abstaining, they will then view their self-worth as less as they no longer have their virginity, leading to risky sexual behaviour.<sup id=\"cite_ref-van1988_10-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-van1988-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> Many countries have pulled support for any abstinence-only education due to concerns with the idea of HIV prevention information being coupled with missionary work and message.\n</p><p>Support has also been retracted when abstinence-only sex education was discovered to have been distributing false information regarding condom use and effectiveness. Abstinence-only sex education in Uganda has reportedly distributed the misinformation that there are tiny pores in condoms that allow the HIV virus to pass through, therefore deeming them unsafe to use against infection.<sup id=\"cite_ref-HRW2003_1-23\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-HRW2003-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> It has also been disseminated that condoms are not effective birth control and the chance of getting pregnant is very high.  This information that is easily disproven in the Global North, is difficult to combat in Uganda when it comes from political, spiritual and community leaders.  This further stigmatizes condom use and lowers the likelihood that people engaging in sexual acts will use them. This misinformation is a large proponent against abstinence-only sex education as the organizations implementing the programs are unreliable or have proven to be in the past.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Socio-economic_considerations\">Socio-economic considerations</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Abstinence-only_sex_education_in_Uganda&amp;action=edit&amp;section=15\" title=\"Edit section: Socio-economic considerations\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In many situations, the choice to abstain is non-existent. Many young girls and some boys are sex workers, selling their bodies to survive.  In these high-risk environments, the participants do not have the ability to abstain or enter into a faithful monogamous relationship.<sup id=\"cite_ref-HRW2003_1-24\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-HRW2003-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> Abstinence-only sex education in Uganda has been criticized for ignoring the thousands of citizens that are forced into sexual relations and therefore unprotected against HIV/AIDS.  Due to abstinence-only sex education teaching abstinence until marriage as the only option, many sex workers do not know about or use condoms.  This creates a breeding ground for HIV transmission.  Abstinence-only sex education is woefully discriminatory against lower socioeconomic peoples.\n</p><p>Outside of sex work, there exists young women and men that also cannot abstain do to social or financial pressure from older parties that act as \"sugar mommies\" and \"sugar daddies\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>  Young men and women engage in sexual relationships in order to obtain items, treats or opportunities that they would not be able to otherwise receive. Abstinence-only sex education in Uganda disregards the existence of these relationships and does not provide any program or policy to protect against HIV/AIDS infection.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Non-recognized_unions\">Non-recognized unions</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Abstinence-only_sex_education_in_Uganda&amp;action=edit&amp;section=16\" title=\"Edit section: Non-recognized unions\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Another criticism levelled at abstinence-only sex education in Uganda is the limiting language and subsequent exclusion that the policy promotes when addressing <a href=\"/wiki/LGBT\" title=\"LGBT\">lesbian, gay and bisexual</a> (LGB) people.
