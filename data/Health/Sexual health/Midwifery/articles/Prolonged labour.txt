Prolonged labour is when the total duration of childbirth is greater than 24 hours.  There are two main types, one when the latent phase of labour is greater than 8 hours and the other when the active phase of labour is greater than 12 hours.  The cause can be due to: poor uterine contractions, the baby's position or size being abnormal, or issues with the pelvis or birth canal.  The last two may result in obstructed labour.
