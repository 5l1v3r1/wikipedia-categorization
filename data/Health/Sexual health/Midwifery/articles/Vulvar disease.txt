A vulvar disease is a particular abnormal, pathological condition that affects part or all of the vulva. Several pathologies are defined. Some can be prevented by vulvovaginal health maintenance. Vulvar cancer accounts for about 5% of all gynecological cancers and typically affects women in later life. Five year survival rates in the United States are around 70%.  Symptoms of vulvar cancer include itching, a lump or sore on the vulva which does not heal and/or grows larger, and sometimes discomfort/pain/swelling in the vulval area. Treatments include vulvectomy â€“ removal of all or part of the vulva. Systemic disorders may be localized in the vulvo-perineal region.
