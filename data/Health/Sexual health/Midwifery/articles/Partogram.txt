A partogram or partograph is a composite graphical record of key data (maternal and fetal) during labour entered against time on a single sheet of paper.  Relevant measurements might include statistics such as cervical dilation, fetal heart rate, duration of labour and vital signs.  It is intended to provide an accurate record of the progress in labour, so that any delay or deviation from normal may be detected quickly and treated accordingly. However, a Cochrane review came to the conclusion that there is insufficient evidence to recommend partograms in standard labour management and care.  A partogram is contained in the Perinatal Institute's "Birth notes".  Use of a partogram in established labour is recommended by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) http://www.nice.org.uk/ in the "Intrapartum Care" guideline.
