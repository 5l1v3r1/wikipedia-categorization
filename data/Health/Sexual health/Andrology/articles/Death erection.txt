A death erection, angel lust, or terminal erection  is a post-mortem erection, technically a priapism, observed in the corpses of men who have been executed, particularly by hanging.  The phenomenon has been attributed to pressure on the cerebellum created by the noose.  Spinal cord injuries are known to be associated with priapism.  Injuries to the cerebellum or spinal cord are often associated with priapism in living patients.  Death by hanging, whether an execution or a suicide, has been observed to affect the genitals of both men and women. In women, the labia and clitoris may become engorged and there may be a discharge of blood from the vagina.  In men, "a more or less complete state of erection of the penis, with discharge of urine, mucus or prostatic fluid is a frequent occurrence ... present in one case in three."  Other causes of death may also result in these effects, including fatal gunshots to the head, damage to major blood vessels, and violent death by poisoning. A postmortem priapism is an indicator that death was likely swift and violent.  In a case reported from Thailand, an excess of sildenafil (Viagra) was thought to be cause of a death erection in a 64-year-old man.
