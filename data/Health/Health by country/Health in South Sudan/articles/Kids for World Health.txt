Kids for World Health (KFWH) aims to cover all aspects of the control and elimination of Sleeping Sickness, Trypanosomiasis, Buruli Ulcer, Chagas Disease, and Leishmaniasis/Kala Azar.   Kids For World Health's motto is "Life is important for all people, rich or poor." Kids for World Health was founded in 2001 at Chatsworth Avenue School, in Larchmont, New York by a then 3rd grade class who were motivated after watching a CBS film from "60 Minutes" on the Southern Sudan Sleeping Sickness Program in 1994. In the beginning, the class of 18 wrote many letters to pharmaceutical companies, contacted the United Nations, contacted the World Health Organization, and studied the research and materials from Doctors Without Borders. They met with the CEO of Bristol Meyers Squibb, and scheduled a trip to Washington D.C. to lobby for African families to have access to drugs.  KFWH Actions to date (April, 2009):
