The Department of Health and Social Care (Manx: Rheynn Slaynt as Kiarail y Theay) is the largest (by number of personnel and budget) of the seven departments of the Isle of Man Government. It was created on 1 April 2014 as a result of a merger of health and social care services from the former Department of Health and Department of Social Care.  The intention to merge the two Departments was announced on 2 December 2013 as part of the Council of Ministers' plans to modernize ministerial government.   The move was by and large a reversal of one element of the restructuring of the Isle of Man Government in April 2010 which saw the former Department of Health and Social Security split to form the Department of Health and the Department of Social Care.
