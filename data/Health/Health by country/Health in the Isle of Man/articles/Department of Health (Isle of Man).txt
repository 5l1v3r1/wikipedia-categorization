The Department of Health (Manx: Rheynn Slaynt) was a department of the Isle of Man Government. It was created on 1 April 2010, taking on the health services and public health functions of the former Department of Health and Social Security.  On 1 August 2012 the Isle of Man's Mental Health Services were transferred from the Department of Social Care to the Department of Health, which also saw the creation of a post for a second Member for the Department with specific responsibility for Mental Health.  On 2 December 2013 as part of the Council of Ministers' plans to modernize ministerial government  it was announced that the Department of Health and the Department of Social Care (with the exception of Social Security, which would move to Treasury) would merge on 1 April, subject to the approval of Tynwald.  The move was by and large a reversal of one element of the restructuring of the Isle of Man Government in April 2010 which saw the former Department of Health and Social Security split to form the Department of Health and the Department of Social Care. During its existence, the Department of Health was the largest in terms of personnel, which is estimated to stand at 1,983.51 full-time equivalent employees at 31 March 2014, representing approx. 25% of central government's public sector workforce. Health functions were part of the Department of Health and Social Security prior to the formation of the Department for Health on 1 April 2010.
