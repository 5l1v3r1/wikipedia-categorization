Smoking in Sweden is at a very low prevalence; only 9% of the total Swedish population (8% of men and 10% of women) smoked in 2016.  Smoking has been banned in all bars and restaurants since May 2005.  A majority of Swedes agreed with the ban.  Sweden was the only European country to achieve the WHO goal of less than 20% daily smoking prevalence among adults by year 2000.  Sweden has a high level of use of smokeless tobacco, specifically a moist snuff product called 'snus', which some Swedes have used as a replacement for smoking.
