Smoking in Taiwan is regulated by the Tobacco Hazards Prevention Act (Taiwan). Tobacco advertising is banned,  and smoking is banned in all indoor public places.  Taiwan was the second Asian country to institute an indoor smoking ban, after Bhutan.  The Government of Taiwan is planning to extend the smoking ban to cars, motorbikes and pedestrians.  Of Taiwan's population of 23 million, about 5 million people smoke.  Within the capital city of Taipei, the prevalence rate decreased to 15.3% in 2009.  2010 was Taipei's Anti-smoking year.  However, in 2013 Taiwan recorded 18% of adult smoking rate, the lowest since 1990. This was the result of the government efforts to discourage smoking since the enactment of the Tobacco Hazards Prevention Act in 1997.  Smoking is prohibited in the following places: Conspicuous non-smoking signs shall be placed at all entrances of the places prescribed in the preceding paragraph. No smoking paraphernalia shall be supplied or displayed therein.
