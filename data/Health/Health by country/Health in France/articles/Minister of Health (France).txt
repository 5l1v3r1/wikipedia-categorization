 Minister of Health and Solidarity is a cabinet position in the Government of France. The health portfolio oversees the health care public services and the health insurance part of the French Social Security. As French ministerial departments are not fixed and depend on the Prime Minister's choice, the Minister sometimes also has one or some of other portfolios among Work, Pensions, Family, the Elderly, Handicapped people and Women's Rights. In that case, he is helped by one or some junior Minister focusing on one part of the portfolio. The current Minister is Agn√®s Buzyn.
