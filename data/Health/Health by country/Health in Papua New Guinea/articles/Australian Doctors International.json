ADI specialises in <i>Doctor Supervised Integrated Health Patrols</i>, deploying volunteer doctors and health managers to work in partnership with local health providers to provide <a href=\"/wiki/Medical_treatment\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Medical treatment\">medical treatment</a> to save lives and reduce suffering, community <a href=\"/wiki/Health_education\" title=\"Health education\">health education</a> to reduce preventable illness and disease, and training to build the capacity of local <a href=\"/wiki/Health_worker\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Health worker\">health workers</a>.\n</p><p>It was founded in 2000 by former Manly Mayor, politician and general practitioner, Dr <a href=\"/wiki/Peter_Macdonald_(Australian_politician)\" title=\"Peter Macdonald (Australian politician)\">Peter Macdonald</a>. The organisation first started working in <a href=\"/wiki/Western_Province_(Papua_New_Guinea)\" title=\"Western Province (Papua New Guinea)\">Western Province</a> in partnership with the Catholic Diocese of Daru-Kiunga to help support their rural health network and services. In 2011 ADI expanded its program to remote and rural areas of <a href=\"/wiki/New_Ireland_Province\" title=\"New Ireland Province\">New Ireland Province</a> in partnership with the Provincial Government.\n</p><p>Its key achievements include: \n</p>\n<ul><li>Deployed more than 30 volunteer doctors on over 38 assignments;</li>\n<li>Distributed 50,000+ malaria bed nets to remote villages in Western Province</li>\n<li>Ran a six-year Mass Drug Administration program to eliminate lymphatic filariasis in the Nomad-Mougulu region of Western Province</li>\n<li>Ran a HIV/AIDS awareness radio program</li>\n<li>Introduced a leprosy treatment, education and advocacy program for a community of over 30 leprosy patients in the Bosset region of Western Province,</li>\n<li>Started an annual in-service health training workshop for over 100 health workers in <a href=\"/wiki/Western_Province_(Papua_New_Guinea)\" title=\"Western Province (Papua New Guinea)\">Western Province</a>, a first for many participants.</li></ul>\n<p>As part of its<i>Doctor Supervised Integrated Health Patrols</i>, ADI\u2019s volunteers travel by plane, boat and foot to remote and rural health centres, aid posts and hospitals to provide essential health care to people living in extreme poverty. Western Province, which is located on the border with West Papua, consists of raging rivers, steep mountain ranges up to 8,000m, vast floodplains and dense jungle. New Ireland Province, which is located off the mainland in the far northeast of PNG, consists of many isolated islands separated by rough seas. It can take weeks to complete a patrol in places such as the <a href=\"/wiki/Star_Mountains\" title=\"Star Mountains\">Star Mountains</a> and <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Awaba_River&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Awaba River (page does not exist)\">Awaba River</a> region in Western Province or Konoagil (otherwise known as The Last Corner by locals) in New Ireland Province.\n</p><p>ADI's services include:\n</p><p><b>1. Medical treatment:</b> To help save lives and reduce suffering, ADI\u2019s doctors currently treat more than 3,500 patients every year. Some people have never seen a doctor before, others only once every couple of years. Consequently, ADI's doctors see many people in advanced stages of disease that could have been prevented. Common diseases and illnesses include malaria and tuberculosis, leprosy, lymphatic filariasis, muscular skeletal, respiratory and serious eye problems.\n</p><p><b>2. Training and education:</b> To help strengthen the capacity of local health workers, ADI\u2019s doctors conduct case-based training during clinics and teach medical education sessions. Every year, ADI also facilitates an in-service health training which brings together health staff from various locations for a week of intensive learning with local and expatriate health experts.\n</p><p><b>3. School and community health education:</b> Many lives are lost due to a lack of knowledge about how diseases are caused, prevented and treated. To help with this, ADI\u2019s doctors and health managers deliver health education talks which address PNG national health priorities and target specific groups. In 2010-2011, ADI\u2019s volunteers gave health talks to over 15,000 adults and school children in Western Province.\n</p><p>Where possible, ADI's doctors work alongside local health workers who perform parallel services including infant <a href=\"/wiki/Immunisation\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Immunisation\">immunisations</a>, eye/ear testing and dental. In New Ireland Province, ADI travels with a large team of provincial and district health staff who undertake community health promotion, health centre management and dental, disease control and environmental health activities.\n</p><p>Approved by AusAID as an OADGR, ADI is a member of ACFID and a signatory to its Code of Conduct. ADI aims for continuous improvement in health indicators as a result of its activities through the use of a structured monitoring and evaluation framework.\n</p><p>PNG has not shown any sustained improvement in health since 2002. It is unlikely to meet any of the <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=UN_Millennium_Goals&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"UN Millennium Goals (page does not exist)\">UN Millennium Goals</a>, especially those on <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Child_and_maternal_mortality&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Child and maternal mortality (page does not exist)\">child and maternal mortality</a>. Rural areas - where 86% of the population lives - are particularly disadvantaged, with 30% of health aid posts closed. The rest are often run-down and under-resourced. <a href=\"/wiki/Doctor_shortage\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Doctor shortage\">Doctor shortage</a> is a major problem. Western Province has just 14 doctors - all urban based - for 212,000 people spread far and wide. This includes one doctor per 8,800 people in North Fly District and no doctor for 74,800 in Middle Fly District. New Ireland Province has just 10 local doctors - all based at Kavieng Hospital - for 160,000 people. Due to heavy workloads and lack of funding, they rarely visit rural health centres and aid posts.\n</p><p>Forty percent of deaths in PNG are caused by six diseases that can be easily and inexpensively treated at aid posts. Diseases such as malaria, <a href=\"/wiki/Tuberculosis\" title=\"Tuberculosis\">tuberculosis</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Pneumonia\" title=\"Pneumonia\">pneumonia</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Diarrhea\" title=\"Diarrhea\">diarrheal</a> diseases, <a href=\"/wiki/Meningitis\" title=\"Meningitis\">meningitis</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/HIV\" title=\"HIV\">HIV</a>/<a href=\"/wiki/AIDS\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"AIDS\">AIDS</a> account for about half of all deaths in PNG. Of every 1,000 children born, 69 will die before age five and another 53 won\u2019t even survive their <a href=\"/wiki/Infancy\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Infancy\">infancy</a>. Five women <a href=\"/wiki/Death_in_childbirth\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Death in childbirth\">die in childbirth</a> every day and only two in five deliver at a health facility.\n</p><p>PNG also has:\n- The highest rate of malaria in the <a href=\"/wiki/Western_Pacific_Ocean\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Western Pacific Ocean\">Western Pacific</a>, a leading cause of death in children under five in PNG;\n- The highest rate of lymphatic filariasis (elephantiasis) in the world, with over 1 million people infected;\n- The highest rate of HIV/AIDS in the Pacific region - an estimated 34,000 people are HIV-positive;\n- The second highest incidence of leprosy in Western Province, despite the disease being treatable and virtually eradicated elsewhere in PNG;\n- High incidence of intestinal diseases, such as <a href=\"/wiki/Cholera\" title=\"Cholera\">cholera</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Typhoid\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Typhoid\">typhoid</a>, due to contaminated food and water;\n- A worsening medical <a href=\"/wiki/Supply_chain\" title=\"Supply chain\">supply chain</a> - only 50% of health centres/hospitals have adequate stocks of the most basic essential medicines.\n</p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw2232\nCached time: 20180916015447\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.032 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.055 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 66/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 4131/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 13/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 6/40\nExpensive parser function count: 1/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\nLua time usage: 0.016/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 818 KB/50 MB\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   40.212      1 Template:Unreferenced\n100.00%   40.212      1 -total\n 65.17%   26.205      1 Template:Ambox\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:16973697-0!canonical and timestamp 20180916015447 and revision id 827540133\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","hidden":"","*":"Articles_lacking_sources_from_February_2018"},{"sortkey":"","hidden":"","*":"All_articles_lacking_sources"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Organizations_established_in_2000"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Medical_associations_based_in_Australia"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Health_in_Papua_New_Guinea"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Foreign_charities_operating_in_Papua_New_Guinea"}],"links":[{"ns":14,"exists":"","*":"Category:Articles lacking sources from February 2018"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"AIDS"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Cholera"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Death in childbirth"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Diarrhea"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Doctor shortage"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"HIV"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Health education"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Health worker"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Immunisation"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Infancy"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Medical treatment"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Meningitis"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"New Ireland Province"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Papua New Guinea"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Peter Macdonald (Australian politician)"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Pneumonia"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Star Mountains"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Supply chain"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Tuberculosis"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Typhoid"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Western Pacific Ocean"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Western Province (Papua New Guinea)"},{"ns":0,"*":"Awaba River"},{"ns":0,"*":"UN Millennium Goals"},{"ns":0,"*":"Child and maternal mortality"},{"ns":4,"exists":"","*":"Wikipedia:Citing sources"},{"ns":4,"exists":"","*":"Wikipedia:Verifiability"},{"ns":12,"exists":"","*":"Help:Introduction to referencing with Wiki Markup/1"},{"ns":12,"exists":"","*":"Help:Maintenance template removal"}],"templates":[{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Unreferenced"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Ambox"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Unsubst"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Message box"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:No globals"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Yesno"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Arguments"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Message box/configuration"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/data"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/config"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/shared"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/blacklist"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Namespace detect/data"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Namespace detect/config"}],"images":["Question_book-new.svg"],"externallinks":[],"sections":[],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Australian Doctors International","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q4824092"}]}}
