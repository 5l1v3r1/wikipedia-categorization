State firearm death rates, 2016. Rate per 100,000 population. National firearm death rate is 11.8.  These numbers include among others death as a result of suicide, self-defense and accidents.

The age-adjusted rates are rates that would exist if the population of each state had the same age distribution as the "standard" US population.

United States: 10.4 This is a list of the U.S. states and the District of Columbia. The population data is the official data from the U.S. Census Bureau.  The murder rates and gun murder rates were calculated based on the FBI reports.  The official population of each state for 2010 and gun ownership rates were added for context.  The official population data from the U.S. Census Bureau in 2010 is 309.3 million. The gun murders in 2010 from FBI reports is 8,775.  In 2010, the reported   gun murder rate for the U.S. was 2.84 per 100,000, the overall estimated gun homicide rate is 3.5. It should be noted that American statistics differ from other countries. For example, "homicide numbers in England and Wales 'exclude any cases which do not result in conviction, or where the person is not prosecuted on grounds of self defence or otherwise.'"  It is reasonably inferred that the U.S. statistics are calculated at more than twice those of other countries due to the inclusion of non-arrest, non-conviction data. For instance, in 2012, the U.S. suffered 14,827 reported homicides for which only 7,133 arrests resulted. The U.S. reports at 70% conviction rate for murder prosecutions.
