Biobank Central is a web-based portal dedicated to advancing the use of human biological materials for research, in order to accelerate the development of new medical therapies and cures. A biobank is a repository that stores biological samples like DNA, tissue, blood, and blood serum. Biobank Central aims to spread public awareness about the critical role of biobanks in research and development, increase the amount of biological data available to researchers, and encourage sharing data among different biobanks around the world. The website provides up-to-date news about biorepositories, offers patient and public education programs, and hosts an open forum for international collaboration. Biobank Central was launched by FasterCures on April 19, 2006, and in its first year of operation was sponsored by IBM Healthcare and Life Sciences, Affymetrix, Bioaccelerate Holdings Inc., and Invitrogen Corporation.
