She graduated from University of Havana in 1939, obtaining a Doctorate degree in Pharmacy, and became the Director of the pharmacy department of the anti-tuberculosis Children's Hospital in Havana. In 1949, she won a scholarship to further studies specialized in Bacteriology with Sir Alexander Fleming, who discovered Penicillin, becoming the first Cuban woman to obtain this scholarship.  She studied under the direction of Dr. Fleming at St. Mary's Hospital in the University of London and, later, Dr. Fleming and his wife visited Tamargo-Sanchez and her family in Cuba, where, at her request, he lectured at the University of Havana.
