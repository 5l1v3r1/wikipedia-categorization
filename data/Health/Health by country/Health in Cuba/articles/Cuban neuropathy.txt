An epidemic of optic and peripheral neuropathy occurred in Cuba during 1992–1993. According to a preliminary summary from the Ministry of Public Health of Cuba (MINSAP), there were 50,862 cases out of a population of 10.8 million.  The etiology is likely nutritional deficiencies, particularly thiamine, compounded by toxic effects of alcohol and tobacco use.  This marked a period of acute food shortage and changes in the Cuban basic diet where studies were done resulting in inconclusive hypothesis, example: the wide introduction of products based on unfermented soy beans affecting vitamin absorption.
