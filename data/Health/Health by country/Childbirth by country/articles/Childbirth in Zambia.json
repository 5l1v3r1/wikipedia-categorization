Preventative measures include changes in the women\u2019s nutrition. Certain foods are considered harmful to the fetus and should be avoided by the mother. For example, eating eggs while pregnant will cause the child to be born without hair.

Most laboring women will have a social support person present during the antepartum period, however if a women gives birth in a hospital, the support person will, most likely, not be present during the actual laboring process. These women are called \u201cmbusas\u201d. Mbusas and those providing support during the laboring process have not received any formal education or training surround care of the laboring women. In most cases they do not have the skills needed to handle obstetrical emergencies. In those cases, they choose to accompany the laboring mothers to maternity units rather than delivering in the home.  The major roles of mbusas during the laboring process is to provide emotional support to the mother.<sup id=\"cite_ref-maimbolwa2003_3-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-maimbolwa2003-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> \n</p><p>When mothers are brought into maternity centers, often do not have any direction making power. Many of the mbusas and those to bring the mothers to the maternity center are often only allowed in the room during visiting hours, however many women will choose to wait outside the unit. Should a mother be able to labor at home most of the power still belongs to them throughout the whole process. Furthermore, women who give birth in a medical center are subjected to more of the \u201ccoercive obstetric procedures\u201d these include birthing positions that are convenient for the health care provider but not the laboring women.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>53% of births occur in the home. The majority of the rest of the birth occur in maternity centers and hospitals. There seems to be a divide between those who gave birth in health care centers as opposed to those who gave at home. This is evidence by the fact that those who gave birth at home, do not receive as much postpartum as those who give birth in a healthcare setting. The women who choose to have a birth at home, states that they feel unwelcome at postpartum care clinics.<sup id=\"cite_ref-do_2-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-do-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Typically in labors occurring in the home mothers are free to choose a birthing position that is most comfortable to them: some of these positions include, <a href=\"/wiki/Sitting\" title=\"Sitting\">sitting</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Kneeling\" title=\"Kneeling\">kneeling</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Squatting_position\" title=\"Squatting position\">squatting</a>.

Typically, no pharmacological pain relief is given to mothers birthing at home and mbusas will resort to using position changes as a way to relive some of the mother\u2019s pain.<sup id=\"cite_ref-maimbolwa2003_3-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-maimbolwa2003-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Once the placenta is delivered it is buried in a specific place near the house or village. It is done this way as to protect the mother and her baby from witchcraft.  The placenta also plays a major role in the preservation of the women\u2019s fertility. One mbusa states: \u201cThe placenta is buried, with the side where the baby lies facing the sky, and leaving the end of the cord showing, so that when the cord drops from the baby it should be connected with the cord buried with the placenta to protect the fertility.\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-maimbolwa2003_3-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-maimbolwa2003-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Some women cite the feelings of embarrassment dictating their personal behaviors. In a qualitative study one woman stated: \u201cI would feel shy to have somebody next to me because we make a lot of noise and we are not covered.\u201d. Furthermore, with the presence of a support person women feel that their behaviors must conform strictly with societal norms, as the support person could tell others if she did not.<sup id=\"cite_ref-maimbolwa2001_5-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-maimbolwa2001-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Should a complication arise women birthing at home do not have the resources of skills to be treated at home, women are transferred to the maternity center if they are able to get there logistically.

The use of technology within hospitals is also limited. For example, continuous fetal monitoring does not occur in most maternity centers.<sup id=\"cite_ref-maimbolwa2003_3-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-maimbolwa2003-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> In hospitals the rate of episiotomies is not documented however it is estimated to be around 28%.<sup id=\"cite_ref-mackeith_7-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-mackeith-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Postpartum\">Postpartum</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Childbirth_in_Zambia&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Postpartum\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Once babies are born they are placed on a delivery mat until the mother delivers the placenta.

Contributing to the high maternal mortality is access to care for mothers in need.

Movement for baby friendly hospitals, ones that accommodate babies in the rooms with moms, promote breastfeeding, and provide lactation consultant services. Protection from HIV is another reason breastfeeding is encouraged, as exclusive breastfeeding builds the baby\u2019s immunity. Prior to the early 2000s, it was believed that HIV+ mothers should not breastfeed to avoid spreading HIV to their baby. When this was proven false and the National AIDS Council published a recommendation for HIV mothers to breastfeed their babies, breastfeeding rates began to rise again around 2007.<sup id=\"cite_ref-leach_8-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-leach-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> An advocacy campaign was launched by the Zambian ministry of health in 2009 to promote improvement of exclusive breastfeeding rate.
