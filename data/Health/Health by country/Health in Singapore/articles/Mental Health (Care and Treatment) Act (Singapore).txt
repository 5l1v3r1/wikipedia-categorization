The Mental Health (Care and Treatment) Act (Singapore)  was passed in 2008 to regulate the involuntary detention of a person in a psychiatric institution for the treatment of a mental disorder, or in the interest of the health and safety of the person or the persons around him.  Form 1 in the first schedule of the act empowers a designated medical practitioner at a psychiatric institution to admit a person suffering from a mental disorder into the psychiatric institution, and detain the patient for up to 72 hours. A patient that has been admitted under Form 1, may be detained for a further period of 1 month after the expiration of the 72-hour period under the provision of Form 2 in the first schedule of the act, if the following requirements are fulfilled: Form 3 allows for a patient detained under form 2 to be further detained for up to 6 months if: Form 4 of the Act allows for visitors to apply to a Magistrate for Form 5. The visitors are appointed by the Minister of Health. At least 12 visitors are appointed at any time, and at least 6 have to be medical practitioners. 2 or more visitors have to visit the designated psychiatric institution at least once every 3 months. Form 5 in the First Schedule of the act is an order made by a Magistrate, which allows for the patient to be detained for a further 12 months.
