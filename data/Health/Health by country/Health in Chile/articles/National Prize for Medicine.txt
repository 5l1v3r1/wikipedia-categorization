The National Prize for Medicine (Spanish: Premio Nacional de Medicina) was created in 2001 by the Chilean Academy of Medicine (es), the Association of Medical Faculties, the Association of Medical Scientific Societies, and the Medical College of Chile (es).  It is given to recognize the work of those doctors who have excelled among their peers in the area of clinical or public health and, in addition, have had a prominent role in teaching, academic administration, or research. The prize consists of a diploma, a commemorative medal, and an amount of money that is contributed by the medical community. It is awarded every two years.
