A Manghihilot is the term used in the Philippines for a person who specializes in healing muscular aches and pains by using massage or a midwife with non-formal midwiferry education. Many of them do not have any formal training.  Rather the skill is passed down from generation to generation.  Like the arbolaryo, the manghihilot does not charge but a voluntary fee is usually demanded.
