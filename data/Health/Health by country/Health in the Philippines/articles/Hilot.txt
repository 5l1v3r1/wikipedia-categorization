Hilot (/HEE-lot/) is an ancient Filipino art of healing. A manghihilot (Hilot practitioner) and the albularyo (herbalist) are usually cheaper alternatives to medical doctors in the Philippines, especially in very deep rural areas.   A Manghihilot employs chiropractic-like manipulation and massage for the diagnosis and treatment of musculoskeletal ailments. They also have been known to reset dislocated and sprained joints such as the knee, ankle, fingers and metacarpal bones. An Albularyo use herbs in addition to massage. The term hilot is also applied to traditional midwives, licensed or otherwise.
