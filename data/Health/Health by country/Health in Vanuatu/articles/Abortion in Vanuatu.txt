Abortion in Vanuatu is severely restricted by criminal law.  Abortion is illegal under the provisions of section 117 of the Vanuatu Penal Code, Act No. 17 or 7 August 1981 . The Code states that any women who intentionally induces a miscarriage is subject to up to two years imprisonment.   Abortion is illegal in cases of rape, incest, and threats to fetal health.  The only allocations for abortion is to save the life or the pregnant women and to preserve physical and mental health.  Under section 113 of the code the legal abortion must be done before the period of 28 weeks.  The Vanuatu Family Health Association reports various methods women use for self-induced abortions, including the use of local leaves or bark from a tree.  Abortions like this that are outside of the medical system endanger the lives of women, as even an immediate visit to a nearby hospital or clinic may be futile if that medical facility does not have the equipment to repair any damage.
