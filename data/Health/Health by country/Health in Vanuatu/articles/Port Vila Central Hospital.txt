Port Via Central Hospital is the principal hospital serving Efate, Vanuatu, near the capital of Port Vila. Situated on a hillside overlooking the lagoon, it has over 200 beds and 6 full-time doctors, with four wardsâ€”medical, surgical, paediatric and maternity.  In 2014 JICA through the Government of Japan handed over to the Government and people of Vanuatu a newly extended Hospital building that consist of General Out Patients (GOPD), Emergency Department, laboratory Department, Radiology Department and a newly Theater. With that people of Vanuatu were so happy and thank the Government and people of Japan for such development it provide to Vanuatu. In March 2015, Australian rescue teams were called in to remove of 100 kilograms of asbestos from the hospital after Vanuatu was struck by Tropical Cyclone Pam.
