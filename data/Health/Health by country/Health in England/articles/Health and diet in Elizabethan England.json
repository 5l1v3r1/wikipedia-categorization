While meat was the main component of the upper-class diet, they occasionally took vegetables such as <a href=\"/wiki/Turnip\" title=\"Turnip\">turnips</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Carrot\" title=\"Carrot\">carrots</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Radish\" title=\"Radish\">radishes</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Fruit\" title=\"Fruit\">fruits</a> such as <a href=\"/wiki/Apple\" title=\"Apple\">apples</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Plum\" title=\"Plum\">plums</a>, and woodland <a href=\"/wiki/Strawberry\" title=\"Strawberry\">strawberries</a>.

The upper classes ate fine white bread called manchet while the poor ate coarse bread of barley or rye.\n</p><p>Both the rich and the poor had imbalanced diets.

However, the lower classes did not benefit much and did not always have enough food. As the English population was fed by its own agricultural produce, a series of bad harvests in the 1590s caused widespread starvation and poverty. The success of the wool trading industry decreased attention on agriculture, resulting in further starvation of the lower classes. Cumbria, the poorest and most isolated part of England, suffered a six-year famine beginning in 1594. Diseases and natural disasters also contributed to the scarce food supply.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In the 17th century the food supply improved. England had no food crises from 1650 to 1725, a period  when France was unusually vulnerable to famines. Historians point out that oat and barley prices in England did not always increase following a failure of the wheat crop, but did do so in France.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Cities\">Cities</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Health_and_diet_in_Elizabethan_England&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Cities\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The population of London increased from 100,000 to 200,000 between the death of Mary Tudor in 1558 and the death of Elizabeth I in 1603. Inflation was rapid and the wealth gap was wide. Men, women, and children begged in the cities, as the children only earned sixpence a week. With the growth of industry, many landlords decided to use their land for manufacturing purposes, displacing the farmers who lived and worked there. Despite the struggles of the lower class, the government tended to spend money on wars and exploration voyages instead of on welfare.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Health_and_diet_in_Elizabethan_England&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Stephen Mennell, <i>All manners of food: eating and taste in England and France from the Middle Ages to the present</i> (University of Illinois Press, 1996).</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-2\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Andrew B.
