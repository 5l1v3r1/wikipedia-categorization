The VÃ¥rdgaranti (National Guaranteed Access to Healthcare) is a standard established in Sweden for public health services. It applies to planned visits and surgery within specialist care. It applies to all planned care that is medically justifiable. It does not apply to emergency care. It was established on 1 November 2005 from which date patients have the right to see a doctor at the health center within seven days from the day they sought help, to see a specialist doctor within 90 days, and initiation of treatment should take place within a further 90 days if the specialist considers this justified. From the day you seek help from a doctor at the health center, you are then "guaranteed" treatment, if needed, in a maximum of 187 days. It does not regulate whether care shall be provided, or what care may be considered. With the enlargement of the care guarantee, there are now clear targets for the availability of the greater part of the continuum of care. The goals are usually expressed with the number series 0-7 - 90 - 90 , indicating the national care guarantee legal time limits in the number of days for the various steps in continuum of care. There are counties and regions that have shorter time limits than the national care guarantee. The waiting period may exceed 90 days, provided that the patient and physician agree to this. In the first instance, visits and treatments are offered in their own county. If the county council can not meet the legal time limits, the patient should be helped to care within the guarantee period of another caregiver. The homeland Parliament will help with all the contacts and this must not entail additional costs for the patient. For monitoring of the care guarantee and the availability of care looks in the county councils / regions have a website:  where details of  waiting times are available. Contact information for each county council care guarantee function is available on the website.
