Abortion in Chad is prohibited by law. According to general medical practice, the medical procedure is only legal if the abortion will save the woman's life, though this is not explicitly stated in any law. Anyone who performs an abortion faces up to five years in prison and a fine, and physicians risk losing their medical licenses for at least five years and possibly indefinitely.  Someone charged for regularly performing abortions faces up to ten years in prison.  According to local experts, women and their physicians are rarely prosecuted for receiving or giving illegal abortions.
