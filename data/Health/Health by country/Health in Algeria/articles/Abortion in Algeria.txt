Abortion in Algeria is only legal if the abortion will save the woman's life or if the pregnancy gravely endangers the woman's physical or mental health.  In Algeria, any abortion performed under different conditions subjects the woman to six to twenty-four months in prison.  The person who performs the procedure may face one to five years in prison, pay a fine, and lose any medical license.  The most common cause of maternal death in Algeria is from uterine perforations, half of which are caused by unsound illegal abortions.  In 1998, Algeria's government lifted its full restriction on abortion to make an exception for women raped by Islamic rebels.  In the four years leading up to this decision, at least 1,600 young women had been abducted by roving bands of the Armed Islamic Group.  Prior to this edict, women were only allowed abortions if they had been deemed insane or in fatal danger.
