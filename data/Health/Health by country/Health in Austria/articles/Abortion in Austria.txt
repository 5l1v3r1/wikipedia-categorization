Abortion in Austria has been fully legalized since 1 January 1975.  Abortions can be performed on demand in hospitals for women during the first three months from the beginning of the pregnancy.  Abortions can be performed later if there is a physical or mental health threat to the pregnant woman, if there is an incurable problem with the development of the fetus, or if the patient is under the age of 14.  There is no punishment for doctors who choose not to perform abortions based on personal or religious convictions, except if the life of the mother is at stake and a lack of abortion causes the mother's death.  The 1975 law protects doctors who choose not to perform abortions.  There are very few abortion clinics or hospitals with abortion capability outside major cities, making it next to impossible to have an abortion in rural areas.  Abortions are not paid for by the government health system.  In 2000 the abortion rate was 1.4 abortions per 1000 women aged 15-44 years.  Abortion in neighbouring Liechtenstein remains illegal. Some women who choose to terminate an unwanted pregnancy cross the border into Austria to undergo the procedure.
