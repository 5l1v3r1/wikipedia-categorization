 This article deals with the fireworks policy in Belgium. The sales of fireworks in Belgium is federally regulated. Since 5 July 2017, the sale of European category F3 fireworks  to non-professionals is a criminal offence; the non-professional customer needs to be at least 12 years old for category F1 and at least 16 years old for category F2; the vendor is required to verify the customer's age.  As of 2017, Belgium does not have a federal policy on the lighting of fireworks, although such regulations have been announced in 2015.  In Flanders, the Gemeentedecreet (Municipal Decree) gives the 308 municipalities of the Flemish Region the authority to introduce a required licence for lighting fireworks, or to prohibit the ignition of fireworks on certain locations.  In almost all Flemish municipalities, an individual can only get a licence in special circumstances (such as weddings). During New Year's Eve, lighting fireworks without a licence is allowed in 35% of the municipalities, in around 50% a permit from the burgemeester (mayor) is required, and around 14% of municipalities have banned consumer fireworks altogether.  In many major cities, professional fireworks shows are held, attended by tens of thousands of people.
