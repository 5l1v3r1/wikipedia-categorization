Three referendums were held in Liechtenstein during 2009.  The first two were held on 29 March and concerned reforming level I of secondary schooling and the introduction of a smoking ban in restaurants, both of which were rejected by voters. The third was held on 6 December on overturning a law introduced in May 2008 which placed an upper level on the electromagnetic field from phone masts,  and was approved by 57% of voters.
