This page serves as a partial list of countries by adult mean body weight and incidence of obese and overweight populations as calculated by body mass index (BMI).   The data for 2014 was first published by the World Health Organisation in 2015. Mean body mass index (BMI) provides a simplified measure of the comparative weight of populations on a country by country basis.  BMI calculates a person's mass (weight) divided by the square of their height. An individual with a BMI of 25 kg/m2 or more is considered overweight.  An individual with a BMI of 30 kg/m2 or more is considered obese. The data highlighted on this page comes from World Health Organisation statistics for adult (18 years old and older) populations. Mean BMI data is shown separately for males and females, as well as a combined figure. Mean data highlights the central tendency of the population data and is but one method of calculating relative body weight between populations. There are significant limitations to the usefulness of comparative BMI data cited by both the medical community and statisticians.  BMI data has significant weaknesses in terms of scalability and in accounting for variations in physical characteristics.     Data published in 2015.  Data published in 2017.
