The Uganda AIDS Orphan Children Foundation (UAOCF) is a non-profit charity that helps vulnerable children and those orphaned by AIDS in Uganda.  UAOCF received 501 (c) (3) charity status in 2003; subsequently, the Internal Revenue Service granted permanent public charity status in 2006.  The foundation's mission is to provide support to orphans in foster homes and to support Hope House, the Kabale Diocese residential facility/technical school for orphans.  As of April 2009, UAOCF supports over 50 children at Hope House and over 350 all together.  Based in Los Angeles, California  and with operations in four Ugandan districts: Kabale, Rukungiri, Kisoro and Kanungu, UAOCF was formed in 2004 in response to the far-reaching repercussions of the AIDS epidemic.  The Sub-Saharan African nation has more than 2.3 million children orphaned due to AIDS-related deaths.  With a total population of more than 30 million, Uganda has the highest proportion of AIDS orphans of any country in the world.   The organization is dedicated to draw attention to the plight of these orphans. Uganda has been greatly impacted by the devastation of HIV/AIDS.  Recent statistics from the World Health Organization show that AIDS has left a long-lasting effect on Uganda’s population, most notably children and families.   As a result, AIDS has caused over 2 million children of Uganda to have been orphaned since the epidemic began – losing one or both parents to AIDS.
