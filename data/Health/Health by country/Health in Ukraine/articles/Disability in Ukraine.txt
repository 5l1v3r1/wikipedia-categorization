2.7 million people in Ukraine (6% ) were reported having a disability in 2014.  This number did not include the (reportedly) 1.5% of people with temporary disabilities.  In 2014, 35% of people aged 60â€“70 had some age-related disability. For people aged over 80 years, this number grew to 50%.  Ukraine is notoriously "disability unfriendly".   For example in the capital Kiev only 4% of infrastructure is considered to be "disability friendly"..  In the 1990s unemployment rates for disabled rose sharply in Ukraine (and other Eastern European countries) due to economic downfall.  Ukraine is one of the most successful countries of the Paralympic Games.
