It was founded with the support of <a href=\"/wiki/Tony_Hawks\" title=\"Tony Hawks\">Tony Hawks</a>, the British writer and comedian, author of the best-seller \"<a href=\"/wiki/Playing_the_Moldovans_at_Tennis\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Playing the Moldovans at Tennis\">Playing the Moldovans at Tennis</a>\"  and the support of the British philanthropic organization ChildAid.\n</p><p>The mission of the Hippocrates centre is to improve the quality of health of disabled children from marginalized families by improving their access to high-quality medical recovery services in order to facilitate their efficient integration into society. \n</p><p>The suffering caused by chronic conditions in children both to the children themselves and to their families has served as an incentive for founding this non-governmental, non-profit organisation for children with <a href=\"/wiki/Chronic_diseases\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Chronic diseases\">chronic diseases</a> coming from socially vulnerable families, at a time when the Moldova is undergoing significant political and economic changes, while poverty levels have registered worrying levels. The crisis in the Moldovan healthcare system has made many specialists explore the possibility of non-pharmacological treatments, comparatively less expensive and yet relatively successful for the recovery/rehabilitation of patients with chronic conditions. \n</p><p>The main objectives of the Hippocrates Centre are: To provide medical recovery services to children with chronic conditions by means of non-invasive, low-cost treatment methods such as <a href=\"/wiki/Physical_therapy\" title=\"Physical therapy\">physical therapy</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Occupational_therapy\" title=\"Occupational therapy\">occupational therapy</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Massage_therapy\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Massage therapy\">massage therapy</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Electrotherapy\" title=\"Electrotherapy\">electrotherapy</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Orthotics\" title=\"Orthotics\">orthotics</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Speech_therapy\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Speech therapy\">speech therapy</a>; Children from birth up to the age of 15 who have chronic neuromuscular, skeletal, cardiovascular or respiratory illnesses are treated. To provide parents and carers with educational services in regard to selection of efficient recovery and treatment methods appropriate for their child.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"External_links\">External links</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Hippocrates_Centre&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: External links\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tonyhawkscentru.md/\">Hippocrates Centre Official Website</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.tony-hawks.com/philanthropy/\">Tony Hawks's Philanthropy Webpage</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.childaidee.org.uk/\">ChildAid</a></li></ul>\n<p><span id=\"coordinates\" class=\"metadata coord-missing\"></span>\n</p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw1263\nCached time: 20180903164904\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.008 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.014 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 43/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 428/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 117/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 6/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    3.477      1 Template:Coord_missing\n100.00%    3.477      1 -total\n 55.62%    1.934      1 Template:Main_other\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:12324867-0!canonical and timestamp 20180903164904 and revision id 825249085\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","hidden":"","*":"Moldova_articles_missing_geocoordinate_data"},{"sortkey":"","hidden":"","*":"All_articles_needing_coordinates"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Health_in_Moldova"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Medical_and_health_organisations_based_in_Moldova"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Chi\u015fin\u0103u"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Chronic diseases"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Electrotherapy"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Hippocrates"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Massage therapy"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Occupational therapy"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Orthotics"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Physical therapy"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Playing the Moldovans at Tennis"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Republic of Moldova"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Speech therapy"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Tony Hawks"}],"templates":[{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Coord missing"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Main other"}],"images":[],"externallinks":["http://tonyhawkscentru.md/","http://www.tony-hawks.com/philanthropy/","http://www.childaidee.org.uk/"],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"External links","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Hippocrates_Centre","byteoffset":1901,"anchor":"External_links"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Hippocrates Centre","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q17055041"}]}}
