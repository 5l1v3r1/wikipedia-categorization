He was invited in his capacity as a sports person to do a talk on the importance of exercise and a balanced diet.  To engage the children Jeff did some challenges with them. \n</p><p>The project was initially created only for Scotland, but become popular nationally once it went online.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Andrew_Murray_(doctor)\" title=\"Andrew Murray (doctor)\">Dr. Andrew Murray</a>, the Scottish Governments' physical activity champion,  was one of the first people to get involved in the project and helped Jeff with various contacts.  In 2013, Dr. Murray took part in the first 10km bag challenge. 100 x 10kg bags over 100m. \n</p><p>Shona Robison <a href=\"/wiki/Shona_Robison\" title=\"Shona Robison\">Shona_Robison</a>, the Minister for CommonWealth Games and Sports, was one of the first MSP's to acknowledge the benefits of this project.\n</p><p>The project was <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.dunfermlinepress.com/news/roundup/articles/2013/05/05/455603-my-parents-died-from-eating-the-scottish-diet/\">first launched at Dumferline</a> and went on to visit 51 schools in total all across Scotland. \n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Challenges\">Challenges</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Scottish_Community_Project&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Challenges\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The main goal behind the challenges was to raise awareness of the project and its mission: helping people switch to a healthier lifestyle.
