The Scottish Medical Journal is a general medical journal, which publishes original research in all branches of medicine, review articles, history of medicine articles, and clinical memoranda. The editor-in-chief is Robert Carachi (Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Glasgow). The journal obtained its current form in 1956 after a merger of the Glasgow Medical Journal and the Edinburgh Medical Journal, which were themselves founded in 1822 and 1855, respectively. It is published by Sage Publications and is supported and sponsored by a number of learned societies and colleges.
