The "Scottish Community Project" is a public health promotion and education project created and managed by Jeff Sladden. Its objective is to raise awareness and help people embrace a healthier lifestyle. The inspiration for this project first appeared when Jeff Sladden was invited to talk at a school in St. Andrews. He was invited in his capacity as a sports person to do a talk on the importance of exercise and a balanced diet.  To engage the children Jeff did some challenges with them.  The project was initially created only for Scotland, but become popular nationally once it went online. Dr. Andrew Murray, the Scottish Governments' physical activity champion,  was one of the first people to get involved in the project and helped Jeff with various contacts.  In 2013, Dr. Murray took part in the first 10km bag challenge. 100 x 10kg bags over 100m.  Shona Robison Shona_Robison, the Minister for CommonWealth Games and Sports, was one of the first MSP's to acknowledge the benefits of this project. The project was first launched at Dumferline and went on to visit 51 schools in total all across Scotland.  The main goal behind the challenges was to raise awareness of the project and its mission: helping people switch to a healthier lifestyle. The two main challenges are the 25 m bag challenge and the 20 m taxi pull. The fire stations were very open to the challenges and helped promote the project. One such example is the bag challenge done with the firefighters from Green Watch Lochgelly. Other notable sponsors include:
