Abortion in Saudi Arabia is generally illegal with only a very narrow exception.  An abortion is only legal if the abortion will save the woman's life or if the pregnancy gravely endangers the woman's physical or mental health.   The fetus must be less than four months old, and if longer, requires a panel of approved specialists to declare that the pregnancy will result in the death of the woman.  Any approved abortion requires consent from three physicians as well as the patient and her husband or guardian.  If an abortion is performed on a woman for any other reason, the violator may be required to pay blood money to the unborn child's family.  Laws explicitly deny abortion to families who fear financial instability or an inability to provide the child with education.
