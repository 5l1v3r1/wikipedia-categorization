The Saudi Commission for Health Specialties (SCHS; Arabic: الهيئة السعودية للتخصصات الصحية‎) is a Saudi Arabian professional body that regulates health care-related practices and accreditation at all levels in Saudi Arabia. The SCHS was established on 2 June 1992 by Royal Order M/2 to set standards for health practice. Its headquarters is in Riyadh and it has several branch offices across the Kingdom. SCHS has supported and approved more than 35 training programs. In many higher medical centers in Saudi Arabia, the Saudi Commission for Health Specialties is regarded as a "dys-regulatory" organisation that in many aspects severely hampers the provision of dedicated health care to the Saudi population by implementing a notoriously abusive financial system for healthcare providers and yet, poor quality standards and nepotism.
