 Ministry of Health (Arabic: وزارة الصحة‎) is the ministry responsible for the health of the citizens of Saudi Arabia. The current minister is Dr. Tawfiq Al Rabiah. In 1925, Saudi Arabia's first public health department was established in Makkah.  The department was responsible for building hospitals and healthcare centers and issuing and enforcing regulations to provide necessary standards for practicing medicine and pharmacology.  A public health council was also established to address the growing need for healthcare services and it was the highest-level supervisory board, overseeing all aspects of the country’s healthcare services.  Then, these health-care institutions were transformed into a ministerial body in 1950.  Abdullah bin Faisal Al Saud was the first health minister.  The ministry is based in Riyadh.  Health-care services in Saudi Arabia are provided by several public and private agencies. However, the ministry is the major planner and provider of these services.
