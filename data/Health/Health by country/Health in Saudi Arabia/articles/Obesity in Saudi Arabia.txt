Obesity in Saudi Arabia is a growing health concern with health officials stating that it is one of the leading causes of preventable deaths in Saudi Arabia. According to Forbes, Saudi Arabia ranks 29 on a 2007 list of the fattest countries with a percentage of 68.3% of its citizens being overweight (BMI>25).  Compounding the problem, according to a presentation at the 3rd International Obesity Conference in February 2014, is that obesity-related surgeries are not covered under Saudi healthcare.
