The Hauora is a Māori philosophy of health and well-being unique to New Zealand.  There are four dimensions of Hauora; Taha Tinana (Physical Wellbeing - health), Taha Hinengaro (Mental & Emotional wellbeing - self-confidence), Taha Whanau (Social Wellbeing - self-esteem) and Taha Wairua (Spiritual wellbeing - personal beliefs) There is physical, emotional/mental, social and spiritual caring.  The Whare Tapa Wha model represents aspects of Hauora as the four walls of a whare, each wall representing a different dimension. All four dimensions are necessary for strength and stability.  Other models of Hauora have been designed. For example, in 1997, Moeau suggested that a fifth dimension, whenua (connection with the land), be added to the original model. In 2001, Hokowhitu also tried to have whenua added to the Tapawha model but again it was not added. The Hauora has been integrated into primary and secondary schools in New Zealand to allow students to learn and understand the traditional Māori aspects of well-being.
