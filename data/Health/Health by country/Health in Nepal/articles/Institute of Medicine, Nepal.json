Within the first decade of its establishment, the IOM developed 12 campuses scattered over the country: three campuses in Kathmandu and nine outside the <a href=\"/wiki/Kathmandu_Valley\" title=\"Kathmandu Valley\">Kathmandu Valley</a>.\n</p><p>Initially, the emphasis of IOM was on the training of middle-level health workers. Programmes serving this purpose include ANM, CMA, Proficiency Certificate Course in General Medicine, Pharmacy, Radiology, Physiotherapy, Nursing, Health Laboratory and Traditional Medicine.\n</p><p>The institutional goals of IOM have continued to change. The mission of the IOM expanded into training tertiary-level health professionals. By 1977 it had at the graduate level two-year Bachelor programmes in Community Nursing, Paediatric Nursing and Adult Nursing.\n</p><p>In 1978, a community-oriented integrated MBBS programme was started with intake of 22 students. Subsequently, the class size was increased to 60, and in 2013 it was further increased to 76.\n</p><p>In a groundbreaking moment for the institute, Professor Prakash Sayami was appointed as the new dean of the Institute, prompted by a second fast-unto-death by Professor <a href=\"/wiki/Govinda_K.C.\" title=\"Govinda K.C.\">Govinda K.C.</a> This brought a change to the system of appointment of the officials on the basis of political affiliations and promulgated the system of seniority in the Institute.\n</p><p>Mounting pressure from the Tribhuvan University officials on political appointments and provision of affiliations to resource-poor hospitals led to the resignation of Professor Prakash Saymi. He was succeeded by political appointee Prof. Sashi Sharma. Sharma is alleged to be involved in embezzlement of large amounts of money during his term as the vice-president of Nepal Medical Council and was subjected to investigations by the <a href=\"/wiki/Commission_for_the_Investigation_of_Abuse_of_Authority_(CIAA)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA)\">Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA)</a>.

The first nursing school became an IoM campus and the second one, an extension campus. These campuses ran a three-year nursing certificate programme that remained very oriented to hospital nursing, though the curriculum continued to prepare nurses for hospital services.\n</p><p>In 1987, following a major review process which extended over several years, a new primary health-care oriented curriculum was introduced. This curriculum intends to meet the health-care needs of the people of Nepal. Therefore, the aim is to produce graduates who have the knowledge, understanding and skills to provide preventive, promotive, curative, rehabilitative aspects of care, to individuals, families and community.\n</p><p>The existing two-track post basic BN program was started in 1968. The decision to start the revised program was based on having one nursing program at the Bachelor level with two tracks/community nursing and hospital nursing. Having two tracks with students taking a common course in areas of teaching, leadership management and research helped to prepare nurses to be flexible and adapt to any area of practice. Since the introduction of the first post-basic program, 404 nurse have graduated.\n</p><p>The recent development in nursing education is a program leading to a master's degree in nursing (MN). The result of a study conducted in 1991 to determine the need for and the feasibility of introducing an MN program, indicated that with the expansion of health services, there would be a need for more nursing positions requiring higher level qualifications. The study results also indicated that with the expansion of health services, there would be a need for more nursing positions requiring higher level qualifications. The study results also indicated that 90 percent of the BN graduates surveyed were interested in undertaking study at the master's degree level in Nepal. The curriculum for the MN program was developed and plans were implemented in April, 1995.\n</p><p>The most recent program in Nursing is B.Sc Nursing which was started in 2005 AD with 20 students. The program was focused in meeting the international standard of four years bachelor's degree and provide the nation with high skilled manpower in the field of nursing.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Faculty_of_Ayurveda\">Faculty of Ayurveda</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Institute_of_Medicine,_Nepal&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: Faculty of Ayurveda\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Institute of Medicine (IOM) provides <a href=\"/wiki/Bachelor_of_Ayurveda,_Medicine_and_Surgery\" title=\"Bachelor of Ayurveda, Medicine and Surgery\">Bachelor of Ayurveda, Medicine and Surgery</a> (BAMS) through Ayurveda Campus, Kritipur.
