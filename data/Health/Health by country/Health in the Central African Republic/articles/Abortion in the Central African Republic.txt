Abortion in the Central African Republic is prohibited by law unless the pregnancy is the result of rape. According to general medical practice, the medical procedure is only legal if the abortion will save the woman's life, though this is not explicitly stated in any law.  Anyone who performs an abortion faces up to five years in prison and a fine, and physicians risk losing their medical licenses for up to five years.   Prior to 2006, law in the Central African Republic explicitly outlawed abortion. In 2006, the National Assembly legalized abortion care in cases of rape, as women regularly faced sexual violence, rape, and gang rape in the war-ravaged country.  Women with unwanted pregnancies in the Central African Republic do not have legal access to medical care. They still seek reproductive health care, but experts believe they often resort to conditions that are not sterile or medically safe.
