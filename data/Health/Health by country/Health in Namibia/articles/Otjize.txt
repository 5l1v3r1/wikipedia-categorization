Otjize is a mixture of butterfat and ochre pigment used by the Himba people of Namibia to protect themselves from the harsh desert climate since the weather is very harsh. The paste is often perfumed with the aromatic resin of Commiphora multijuga (omuzumba). The mixture lends the skin a deep orange or reddish tinge. This symbolises earth's rich red color and blood the essence of life, and is the Himba ideal of beauty.  The Himba use otjize in their hair as well, which is long and plaited into intricate designs.   Otjize is also used for hygienic purposes due to water scarcity. Over time, otjize flakes off, removing dirt and dead skin. Wood ash is used to wash the hair.
