While taking care of her father, she got the idea that she would study to be a <a href=\"/wiki/Physician\" title=\"Physician\">doctor</a>, even though there were no women doctors in Finland at the time. She <a href=\"/wiki/Studentexamen\" title=\"Studentexamen\">matriculated</a> from the Helsinki Co-educational School in the spring of 1896.

She started her work at the <a href=\"/wiki/Oniipa\" title=\"Oniipa\">Oniipa</a> mission station. Even during her first month there, she treated between 40 and 50 patients every day. She had no time to study the <a href=\"/wiki/Ndonga\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Ndonga\">Oshindonga</a> language, but had to ask other missionaries to interpret for her. When she arrived in Ovamboland, the area suffered from the great <a href=\"/wiki/Famine\" title=\"Famine\">famine</a> of 1907\u201308. During the first year, 7 525 <a href=\"/wiki/Outpatient_clinic_(hospital_department)\" title=\"Outpatient clinic (hospital department)\">patients</a> were helped, which meant 25 patients per day on average. The number became smaller when a small fee began to be charged from the patients. On the other hand, the patients did not continue their treatments long enough. When the worst pains were over, they thought they were well again and hurried for work in the fields, especially the women.<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In 1910, Rainio travelled to all the Finnish mission stations in the area.

It had a <a href=\"/wiki/Sheet_metal\" title=\"Sheet metal\">corrugated metal</a> roof, the first of its kind in Ovamboland. The building had living quarters, and a combined polyclinic and <a href=\"/wiki/Pharmacy\" title=\"Pharmacy\">pharmacy</a> in one room, another room for the necessary <a href=\"/wiki/Surgery\" title=\"Surgery\">operations</a>, and a room for missionary patients. The Ovambos were cared for in huts, of which there were first eight and more were built later. The hospital was inaugurated in a mission feast held in July 1911. The inauguration was performed by the assistant director of the FMS, <a href=\"/wiki/Pastor\" title=\"Pastor\">Rev.</a> <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Hannu_Haahti&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Hannu Haahti (page does not exist)\">Hannu Haahti</a> together with the head of the mission in Ovamboland, Rev. <a href=\"/wiki/Martti_Rautanen\" title=\"Martti Rautanen\">Martti Rautanen</a>.

The latter had spent some time in <a href=\"/wiki/Windhoek\" title=\"Windhoek\">Windhoek</a> getting familiar in the work of a midwife. Also two Ovambo <a href=\"/wiki/Evangelism\" title=\"Evangelism\">evangelists</a> were hired, and they took care of preaching the <a href=\"/wiki/Gospel\" title=\"Gospel\">Gospel</a> to the patients.<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>During the inspection trip of Rev. Haahti, Rainio was able to achieve a breakthrough for the medical mission: during the inspection meetings were held about the Finnish missionary work, and Rainio was allowed to write preliminary thoughts on the medical work, and the decisions were taken on the basis of her thoughts.<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In 1913 Rainio made a so-called \u201chealth trip\u201d to the <a href=\"/wiki/Cape_Province\" title=\"Cape Province\">Cape</a>. She was now able to make a recommendation to the FMS, on the basis of her own experiences, that all missionaries be granted the possibility to make such trips. In addition to the healthy <a href=\"/wiki/Oceanic_climate\" title=\"Oceanic climate\">oceanic climate</a>, the benefits of the Cape included a possibility to participate in <a href=\"/wiki/Culture\" title=\"Culture\">cultural</a> activities. The missionaries had wanted to make such trips before, but only now, when a medical doctor recommended them, the board of the FMS could not ignore these wishes.<sup id=\"cite_ref-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Problems_on_the_mission_field\">Problems on the mission field</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Selma_Rainio&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Problems on the mission field\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In the early years, the female missionaries encountered a number of problems. The worst of them was the so-called <i>meeting of the brethren</i>, in which women could not participate. In addition to this, the women were allowed to read the annual reports of the mission field only after they had been printed in Helsinki and shipped back to Africa. Rainio began women\u2019s missionary meetings, but these came to a halt after only a year. However, during the visit of Rev. Haahti, general meetings of the missionaries were held in Ovamboland, and this then became the practice on the mission field.\n</p><p>It could also be observed that the salaries of the women were quite inferior to those of the men.<sup id=\"cite_ref-14\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The relationship between the missionaries and the board of trustees of the FMS were strained, mainly because the board chose to believe in all kinds of rumours and did not make attempts to find out what was going on in the mission field. Rainio also was perplexed about the fact that the missionaries were not allowed to write in public about the tightening grip of the <a href=\"/wiki/German_Reich\" title=\"German Reich\">German Reich</a> on Ovamboland. This was due to the fact that Germany and <a href=\"/wiki/Russia\" title=\"Russia\">Russia</a> had become more and more hostile towards each other during the years leading up to <a href=\"/wiki/World_War_I\" title=\"World War I\">World War I</a>, but this was not known to the missionaries.<sup id=\"cite_ref-15\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Rainio also thought that the Finns could have had more beneficial attitudes towards the Ovambos. It had been wrong of the Finns to demand that the Ovambos dress in a <a href=\"/wiki/Europe\" title=\"Europe\">European</a> manner. On the other hand, when this change had been achieved, the FMS wanted to stop sending clothes to them. Rainio asked her sister Lilli to instruct the sowing societies and friends of the mission to keep on sending clothes to Ovamboland.\n</p><p>The missionaries were not interested in the customs and thoughts of the Ovambos. This led to some of the old customs falling into <a href=\"/wiki/Ash_heap_of_history\" title=\"Ash heap of history\">oblivion</a>, including some that in Rainio\u2019s opinion would have been worth keeping.<sup id=\"cite_ref-16\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-16\">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Consequences_of_the_Great_War\">Consequences of the Great War</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Selma_Rainio&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Consequences of the Great War\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>As a consequence of <a href=\"/wiki/World_War_I\" title=\"World War I\">World War I</a>, the connections between Finland and Ovamboland were cut off for nearly 18 months. For example, in the beginning of 1916, none the salaries of the previous year had been paid to the Finnish missionaries. Also the <a href=\"/wiki/Aid\" title=\"Aid\">food aid</a> from the German Colonial Government to the Onandjokwe Hospital had ended soon after the outbreak of the war, and then the <a href=\"/wiki/South_Africa\" title=\"South Africa\">South African</a> troops soon seized the control of the country.\n</p><p>In March 1915, the hospital had to be closed for some time, as it had run out of <a href=\"/wiki/Grocery\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Grocery\">groceries</a>, and it was difficult to find people to work for the hospital among the Ovambos. The food stuffs that Rainio had brought with her the year before had lasted until then.\n</p><p>Among the Ovambos, various illnesses, such as the <a href=\"/wiki/Beriberi\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Beriberi\">beriberi</a> became common. Also <a href=\"/wiki/Infection\" title=\"Infection\">bacterial infections</a> became common in the hospital. In December 1915 the hospital had to be closed, because the patients began to die one after another. However, the polyclinic continued its operation. The hospital work could only be continued when the infected patient huts had been demolished and new ones had been built to replace them.\n</p><p>In 1915 several Finns were also among the patients, and likewise the head of the English government, Major Pritchard. Thanks to the latter, the new government soon began to issue foodstuffs to the hospital.<sup id=\"cite_ref-17\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-17\">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Rainio_falls_ill\">Rainio falls ill</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Selma_Rainio&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Rainio falls ill\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In 1917, Rainio fell seriously ill.

However, good <a href=\"/wiki/Nutrition\" title=\"Nutrition\">sustenance</a> and a recuperation period of five weeks restored her energies.

In June 1920, she worked in the Kivel\u00e4 Hospital in Helsinki, and then she travelled to T\u00fcbingen to learn the latest developments in tropical diseases. Even there she lectured on her work in Ovamboland, as requested by the head of the institute, Professor <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Gottlieb_Olpp&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Gottlieb Olpp (page does not exist)\">Gottlieb Olpp</a>.

She did not want to return to Africa, because the FMS had made cuts on the budget of Onandjokwe. However, she changed her decision, although she did not appear to be excited about the matter. Her decision was affected by the fact that the missionaries in Ovamboland were tired and there were too few of them for the tasks on hand.

She arrived in Ovamboland in September. While in Widnhoek, she agreed to work for the government as the district physician of Ovamboland. For this, she had to treat all the <a href=\"/wiki/Venereal_disease\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Venereal disease\">venereal diseases</a> of the territory. She was to be paid 100 <a href=\"/wiki/South_African_pound\" title=\"South African pound\">pounds</a>, which she did not consider an adequate compensation. The job entailed a lot of <a href=\"/wiki/Bureaucracy\" title=\"Bureaucracy\">bureaucratic</a> work, mainly a lot of writing of reports, which had to be written in <a href=\"/wiki/English_language\" title=\"English language\">English</a>, which the Finnish missionaries did not know much. The Onandjokwe Hospital was becoming more and more dependant on the financial aid of the government, for which reason Rainio did not want to turn down the offer to work as the district physician.\n</p><p>At Onandjokwe she was assisted by nurse Karin Hirn along with Karin L\u00f6nnberg.

At that time she tried to persuade her sisters to come and visit her, but to no avail. During that year, 571 patients were treated in the hospital, and more than 7 000 persons got help from the polyclinic. In 1924 these figures were somewhat lower and mortality was higher, because an <a href=\"/wiki/Influenza\" title=\"Influenza\">influenza</a> arrived from the south, where in the mines of <a href=\"/wiki/L%C3%BCderitz\" title=\"L\u00fcderitz\">L\u00fcderitz</a> 400 Ovambos died of this disease.

Then she fell ill with <a href=\"/wiki/Erysipelas\" title=\"Erysipelas\">erysipelas</a> in the skin of her head, and she feared she would die, as no treatment was known for the disease at the time.

The <a href=\"/wiki/Anglicanism\" title=\"Anglicanism\">Anglican</a> mission sent a doctor to Ovamboland in 1927, which eased Rainio\u2019s work load. The Anglican doctor probably worked at St Mary\u2019s in <a href=\"/wiki/Odibo\" title=\"Odibo\">Odibo</a>, which had been founded in 1924.<sup id=\"cite_ref-25\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-25\">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In 1929 Rainio was able to make a \u201chealth trip\u201d again, after many years, to the Cape, and during it she was able to visit the Enjamana leprosy sanatorium and acquaint herself with the work done there.<sup id=\"cite_ref-26\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-26\">&#91;26&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In 1930, Rainio fell ill again with erysipelas in her head, and she also suffered from serious attacks of malaria, but again she recovered from both illnesses.
