Abortion in Angola is only legal if the abortion will save the woman's life.  In Angola, any abortion performed under different conditions subjects the woman and the person who performs the procedure to up to three years in prison.  If the woman dies as a result of the abortion, the criminal charges are increased by one-third.  Angolan measures to reduce the number of unsafe illegal abortions by making legal abortions more accessible have been difficult to pass because of the nearly 60% Catholic populace.
