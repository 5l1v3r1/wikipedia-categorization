Adult-onset immunodeficiency syndrome is a provisional name for a newly diagnosed immunodeficiency illness. The name is proposed in the first public study to identify the syndrome.  It appears to be chronic and non-contagious, affecting mainly people of Asian descent aged around 50.   Cases first started appearing in 2004, primarily in Thailand and Taiwan. At least one physician associates the symptoms with tuberculosis. Some lethal overwhelming infections are reported, aggravating people who already suffer other conditions such as HIV/AIDS. Little is publicly known about the underlying factors causing the disease. Genetic factors are suspected, but the disease does not appear to be heritable. Also, something in the environment may trigger the disease. An elevated concentration of autoantibodies that block interferon-gamma was detected in most patients. The swash.com website uses AIDS 2.0 as the moniker for maybe another, apparently highly contagious AIDS-like condition described by The Epoch Times.  The Daily Beast has described this disease emphatically as not AIDS 2.0.
