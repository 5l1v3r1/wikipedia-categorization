Plan Bolívar 2000 (launched February 27, 1999) was the first of the Bolivarian Missions enacted under administration of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez. According to the United States Department of State, Chávez wanted to "send the message that the military was not a force of popular repression, but rather a force for development and security". The State Department also commented that this happened "only 23 days after his inauguration" and that he wanted to show his closest supporters "that he had not forgotten them".  The plan involved around 40,000 Venezuelan soldiers engaged in door-to-door anti-poverty activities, including mass vaccinations, food distribution in slum areas, and education.   The program also transported thousands of poor and ill Venezuelans at cost by military cargo planes and helicopters to seek employment and medical care. The Plan Bolívar 2000 was Chavez' own idea. He wanted it to be implemented in three stages: Chavez’s social policies are where his contribution weighs in the most because of the amount of money being redirected to the people.  In an October 2002 interview, President Chávez stated that: Several scandals affected the program as allegations of corruption were formulated against Generals involved in the plan, arguing that significant amounts of money had been diverted.
