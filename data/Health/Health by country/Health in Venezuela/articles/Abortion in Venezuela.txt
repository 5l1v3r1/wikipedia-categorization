Abortion in Venezuela is illegal except in cases of a threat to the life of the pregnant woman. The punishment for a woman who has an abortion for any other reason is a prison sentence lasting anywhere between six months and two years. While the punishment for a doctor or any person who performs the procedure is between one and three years, harsher penalties may apply if the pregnant woman dies as a result of the procedure.  In May 2006, Pope Benedict XVI met with President Hugo Chavez to discuss his concern over the possibility that Chavez would loosen abortion laws in Venezuela.  To help combat this type of opposition to lifting abortion restrictions, citizens formed Venezuelaâ€™s National Constituent Assembly (ANC) in July of 2017. Their goal is to reform Venzuela's constitution to include women's right to abort beyond that life or death circumstances.
