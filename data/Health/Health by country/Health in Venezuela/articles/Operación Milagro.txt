Operación Milagro (English: Operation Miracle; also Acción Milagro) is a program of international solidarity launched in 2004 by the governments of Cuba and Venezuela to provide free medical treatment for people with eye problems in the two countries and 34 others in the Global South. It is integrated into the programs of the ALBA. While in the initial stage of the program patients were transported to Cuba to be attended there, now there are 49 ophthalmological centers in 13 Latin American and Caribbean countries carrying out vision-saving and restoring surgery. The Cuban government has also sent physicians to Pakistan, Indonesia and Angola. In its first ten years, the program has benefitted more than three million people.
