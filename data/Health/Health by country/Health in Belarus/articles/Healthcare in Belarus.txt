 Healthcare in Belarus is supervised by the Ministry of Health and funded by general taxation through the National Health Service. Belarusian healthcare is cheap and easily available, although specialized care is rare. Since 1986, survivors of the Chernobyl disaster with medical repercussions have overwhelmed the system.  Quality healthcare in Belarus is concentrated around urban areas, where purchasing powers are higher, leading to an inequality of health services in the rural areas. In 1994 there were 127 hospital beds and forty-two doctors per 10,000 inhabitants. The country had 131,000 hospital beds at 868 hospitals.
