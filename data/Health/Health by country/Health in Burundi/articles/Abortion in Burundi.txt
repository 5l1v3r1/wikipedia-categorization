Abortion in Burundi is only legal if the abortion will save the woman's life or if the pregnancy gravely endangers the woman's physical, or potentially mental, health.  In Burundi, two certified physicians must agree that the pregnancy is threatening before giving medical assistance.  Even in cases in which an abortion practitioner has deemed that the pregnancy has endangered the woman, both the physician and woman may be subject to prison time and fines.
