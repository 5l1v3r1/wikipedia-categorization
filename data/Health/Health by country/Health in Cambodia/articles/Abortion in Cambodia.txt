Abortion in Cambodia is legal upon request within the first twelve weeks of pregnancy.  After twelve weeks, abortions are only legal in Cambodia when they will save the woman's life or preserve her health, the pregnancy is a result of rape, or the child may be born with an incurable disease.  In any of these instances, at least two medical personnel must approve the abortion.
