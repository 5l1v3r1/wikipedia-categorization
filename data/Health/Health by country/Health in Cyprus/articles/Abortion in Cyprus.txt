Abortion in Cyprus was fully legalized in March 2018. Abortion can be performed on request up until the 12th week of pregnancy (first trimester) and until 19th week in case of rape.  Previously, abortion was only performed if there was a risk of physical or mental harm to the mother; if there was a risk of fetal deformity; or if the patient was raped or was in some way the victim of a sexual crime.   While there is no specific guideline limiting when abortion is permitted under Cypriot law, in practice no abortions are committed after the twenty-eighth week.  Cyprus has a natalist policy  and thus will not provide routine abortion procedures in state hospitals, so they are typically performed in private clinics, with hospitals only providing the procedure if the mother is at great risk.  As abortions are paid out of pocket by the woman undergoing the procedure, private practitioners can and have performed abortions outside the legal framework.
