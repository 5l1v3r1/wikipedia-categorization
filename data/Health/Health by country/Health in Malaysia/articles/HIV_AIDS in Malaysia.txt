  The first HIV/AIDS case in Malaysia made it debut in 1986 and since has become one of the country's most serious health and development challenges.  As of 2016, 99,338 HIV positive men and 12,578 HIV positive women in Malaysia.   Malaysia is ranked seventh highest in adult prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Asia after Thailand, Papua New Guinea, Burma, Cambodia, Vietnam and Indonesia with a 0.45% prevalence rate.  According to the United Nations, Malaysia is one of the ten countries which together accounted for over 95% of all new HIV infections in the Asia-Pacific region in 2016.  In 2015, Malaysia recorded the rate of 10.9 new cases per 100,000 of the population, which is below than the target set by World Health Organization.  Malaysian HIV/AIDS cases have been reported since 1986 by the Ministry of Health. Since then, the national surveillance system had reported a cumulative of 105,189 HIV cases, 21,384 AIDS and 17,096 deaths related to HIV/AIDS giving total reported PLHIV of 88,093 cases or 96% of estimated PLHIV.  Males still make up the majority of HIV cases (89%), but the number of women with positive status of HIV has been increasing. This is shown by the decreasing trend of male:female ratio of 10:1 in 2002 to 4:1 in 2014.  42% of HIV transmission by age group occurred in 30-39 bracket.  Between January to June 2014, 1,676 cases of HIV and 598 cases of AIDS with 402 deaths were recorded.  Out of this new infection, 79.7% are men. In 2013, heterosexuals transmission recorded the highest (51%), followed by Injecting Drug User (22%) and Homo/Bisexual transmission (22%). According to the Ministry of Health, at present (2016), 70% of HIV transmission are transmitted through heterosexual relationships, mainly from female sex workers to male clients.  Means of Transmission (2013)  The HIV epidemic in Malaysia is concentrated in these key populations;  Sex worker accounts for 0.6% of total reported cases thus far. However, the number of cases reported among sex workers are grossly under reported.  In 2014, Integrated Bio-Behavioral Surveillance (IBBS) in female sex workers shows an increase of sex workers living with HIV to 7.3% from 4.2% in 2012.  An IBBS done in 2009 found HIV prevalence among the group at 9.3%, and was decreased to 4.8% in 2012.  However, in 2014, the IBBS shows an increase of HIV prevalence to 5.6%.  At the beginning of the epidemic, injecting drug user (PWID) accounted for 70-80% of all new reported cases. This has started to decline since 2004. In 2011, PWID accounts for 39% of new reported cases.  In 2014, 16.3% of the PWID are reported living with HIV.  IBBS conducted in 2012 shows 7.1% of MSMs is living with HIV. In 2014, the figure has increased to 8.9%.  In 2001, the Department of Occupational Safety and Health developed a non-compulsory ‘Code of Practice on Prevention and Management of HIV and AIDS’ which supports the creation of a non-judgemental and non-discriminatory work environment.   During the 2011 Nineteenth ASEAN Summit, Malaysia together with other ASEAN nations, adopted the "ASEAN Declaration of Commitment: Getting To Zero New HIV Infections, Zero Discrimination, Zero AIDS-Related Deaths, Bali, Indonesia, 17 November 2011" to reaffirm their commitment in working towards realizing an ASEAN community with Zero HIV Infections, Zero Discrimination and Zero AIDS-related Deaths.  On 13 October 2017, the Ministry of Human Resources Minister, Datuk Seri Dr Richard Riot Jaem announced that the government wants to draft a new regulation in an effort to eliminate discrimination against people living with HIV or AIDS at the workplace. The ministry plans to legislate the HIV and AIDS in Workplace Policy by 2020.   The first line of highly active antiretroviral therapy is provided for free in Malaysia by the Ministry of Health since 2006.  However, only 28% of HIV/AIDS patients seek consistent treatment as the awareness among patients to get treatment was still low because they were ashamed to seek treatment and did not know about the various types of treatment provided by the government to help them fight the disease.  The government hopes the figure will reach 90% in line with the National Strategic Plan Ending AIDS 2016-2030.
