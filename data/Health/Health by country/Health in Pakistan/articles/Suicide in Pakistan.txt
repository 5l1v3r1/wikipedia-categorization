Suicide in Pakistan has been a long-term social issue and is a common cause of unnatural death. Incidents of suicide are often reported in the press and newspapers throughout the country as well as by several non-governmental organisations. However, diagnosing and covering suicide cases has generally been difficult in the local culture due to a number of social stigmas and legal issues that bind the problem; given that suicide is prohibited in Islam, there are various obstacles which come along in openly discussing the phenomenon in Pakistan, a predominantly Muslim country.  Suicide is considered a criminal offence, with punitive laws imposed in place for attempted suicide. National suicide statistics are not compiled on a formal level nor officially reported to the World Health Organisation, thus leaving any obtained data to be neglected and underreported.  While suicide patterns have traditionally been low, there has been a slow but steep increase in the past few years.  One analysis of suicide reports, based over a period of two years, showed over 300 suicidal deaths in Pakistan from 35 different cities.  The findings showed that men outnumber women by 2:1 and that the majority of men who commit suicide tend to be unmarried; the trend for women, however, is the opposite. Research also indicated that the majority of subjects were under the age of 30 and that "domestic problems" are the main reason stated for suicide.  These include unemployment, health issues, poverty, homelessness, family disputes, depression and a range of social pressures. Hanging, use of insecticides and firearms are the most common methods for carrying out suicide in Pakistan.
