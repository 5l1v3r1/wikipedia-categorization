Live births during the decade averaged 16 per 1,000 inhabitants, a significant drop from the 1950s. By 1968 the <a href=\"/wiki/Fertility_rate\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Fertility rate\">fertility rate</a> was under 2 children per woman (in comparison with almost 3 in the 1950s); at this rate the population would not replace itself. In the Czech lands, the <a href=\"/wiki/Population_growth\" title=\"Population growth\">population growth</a> rate stood at its 1930s low; in Catholic Slovakia, it was the lowest on record. The government adopted a variety of explicitly <a href=\"/wiki/Pronatalist\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Pronatalist\">pronatalist</a> policies in the 1970s. Family allowances increased, especially for second and third children. By 1973 a family with three children received roughly one-third the average worker's salary in allowances. <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Birth_grant&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Birth grant (page does not exist)\">Birth grants</a> doubled so that they were the equivalent of two to four weeks of family income. <a href=\"/wiki/Low-interest_loan\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Low-interest loan\">Low-interest loans</a> to newlyweds were designed so that a portion of the principal was canceled with the birth of each child (Kcs 1,000 for the first and Kcs4,000 for each subsequent child). All told, the financial incentives were substantial. In addition, couples with children had priority on apartment <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/waiting_list\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikt:waiting list\">waiting lists</a> and were entitled to larger living quarters, no small inducement in the face of Czechoslovakia's chronic <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Housing_shortage&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Housing shortage (page does not exist)\">housing shortage</a>. Pronatalist policies appear to have had a strong influence on population growth during the 1970s. The birthrate climbed from its 1968 low (14.9 per 1,000 inhabitants) to a peak of 19.9 per 1,000 inhabitants in 1974\u2014one of the highest rates among industrial nations. Perhaps a quarter of this increase reflected the increase in the number of women of child-bearing age in the 1970s. After 1974, however, the <a href=\"/wiki/Birthrate\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Birthrate\">birthrate</a> steadily declined, falling to 14.5 by 1985. Figures indicated that a trend toward one-child families was emerging. The message seemed to be that after one decade the government's aid program was ineffective.\n</p><p>A major factor influencing the birthrate was the <a href=\"/wiki/Abortion\" title=\"Abortion\">abortion</a> rate. The number of abortions fluctuated between the 1950s and 1980s, dropping in the early 1960s and the early 1970s. In 1985 there were reportedly 144,712 abortions, or 39 abortions per 100 pregnancies (33.5 per 100 in the <a href=\"/wiki/Slovak_Socialist_Republic\" title=\"Slovak Socialist Republic\">Slovak Socialist Republic</a> and 42.1 per 100 in the <a href=\"/wiki/Czech_Socialist_Republic\" title=\"Czech Socialist Republic\">Czech Socialist Republic</a>). It has been suggested that abortion has remained one of the most favored means of <a href=\"/wiki/Birth_control\" title=\"Birth control\">birth control</a>, despite the risks involved. A 1986 change in the <a href=\"/wiki/Abortion_law\" title=\"Abortion law\">abortion law</a> (eliminating the panel needed to approve a request for an abortion) suggested that the regime was giving up in its efforts to reverse at least this aspect of the adverse demographic trends.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Housing\">Housing</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Health_and_social_welfare_in_Communist_Czechoslovakia&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Housing\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Since statistics did not always provide a comparison between the numbers of households and existing <a href=\"/wiki/Housing_unit\" title=\"Housing unit\">housing units</a>, the housing deficit remained difficult to gauge. A comparison of the number of <a href=\"/wiki/Marriage\" title=\"Marriage\">marriages</a> annually and construction of new 1 housing units between 1960 and 1975 shows that construction exceeded marriages only in 1975. The deficit was most acute in the 1960s, when an average of housing units was built for every 10 marriages; in 1985 the ratio rose to an average of 8.8 units per 10 marriages.\n</p><p>This approximation underestimated the housing deficit: it ignored divorces, the number of <a href=\"/wiki/Extended_family\" title=\"Extended family\">extended families</a> living together who would have preferred separate housing, and the decay of old housing . Even waiting lists underestimated how inadequate housing was in the 1980s. Separate housing for single adults had such a low priority with planners that single adults found it difficult even to get on a housing list.\n</p><p>One of the factors contributing to the housing shortage was the low construction rate of rental housing. Major reasons for this were high <a href=\"/wiki/Inflation\" title=\"Inflation\">inflation</a>, high <a href=\"/wiki/Construction\" title=\"Construction\">construction</a> costs, and low (heavily subsidized) rents. In 1985 the average building cost for apartments rose to Kcs2,523 per square meter, and the average monthly rent\u2014for the seventh consecutive year\u2014was Kcs358. Construction of individual homes peaked in 1977 at 40,107 and decreased to 29,608 in 1985. Building a home privately was possible, but acquiring labor and materials was difficult and sometimes risky; it often meant borrowing machinery illegally or paying <a href=\"/wiki/Bribe\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Bribe\">bribes</a> for materials.\n</p><p>Despite substantial gains in the 1970s, Czechoslovakia entered the 1980s with a housing shortage that was likely to take years to remedy. In 1986 the government announced a slight cutback in new housing construction for the 1986\u201390 housing plan, further aggravating the situation.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\"
