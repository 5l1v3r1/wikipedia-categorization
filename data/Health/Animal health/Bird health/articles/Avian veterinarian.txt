An avian veterinarian is a veterinarian who specializes in treating birds.  All veterinarians, upon first qualification from a certified veterinary college, may treat any species.  Additional training is required for qualification to become a recognized specialist in the care of birds.   In the United States, a veterinarian can specialize in avian medicine and surgery via post-graduate training through the American Board of Veterinary Practitioners and become a Diplomate of the American Board of Veterinary Practitioners (Avian Practice).  Avian veterinarians can become members of the Association of Avian Veterinarians for additional education opportunities including a journal and an annual conference.  In Europe, veterinarians become recognized as avian specialists by qualifying as a Diplomate of the European College of Zoological Medicine (Avian), and in Australia and New Zealand by qualifying as a Member or Fellow of the Australian and New Zealand College of Veterinary Scientists.
