Bird kill is a localized event resulting in the death of large numbers of birds at the same time. Large die offs of animals are not unusual in nature, and happen for a variety of reasons including bad weather, disease, and poisonings,  with pollution and climate change adding to the stresses on wildlife.  According to the USGS National Wildlife Health Center in the US over the past 10 years 175 mass deaths events exceeding 1,000 birds occurred.  Russian scientist Afanasiy Ilich Tobonov researched mass animal deaths in the 1990s and concluded that the mass deaths of birds and wildlife in the Sakha Republic were noted only along the flight paths of space rockets.
