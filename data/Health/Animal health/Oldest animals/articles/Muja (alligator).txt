Muja, an American alligator at Belgrade Zoo in Serbia, is the oldest living alligator in the world.  Muja became the world’s oldest American alligator in captivity when another of its species, Cabulitis, died in Riga Zoo in Latvia in 2007.  Muјa arrived in Belgrade with another alligator, his mate, on September 12, 1936. from Germany. At the time he arrived he was already an adult, so it is assumed that he was born before 1936. He survived World War II, during which the Zoo was almost completely destroyed, and the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999. In 2012, he underwent a successful surgery to amputate some of his leg after he was diagnosed with gangrene. Otherwise, Muja is healthy. He is fed 5-6kg of meat once a week which he eats together with bones, which are good for his teeth and calcium levels.
