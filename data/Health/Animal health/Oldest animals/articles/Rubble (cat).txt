Rubble (born c. April 1988) is a domestic cat owned by Michelle Foster of Exeter, Devon, England.  Foster acquired the cat as a kitten on or near her 20th birthday.  Rubble, a Maine Coon–type cat, achieved the age of 30 in May 2018 and is currently[when?] the world's oldest living cat.  Foster stated that, "He's a lovely cat, although he has got a little grumpy in his old age. I got him just before my 20th birthday when he was a kitten. Rubble suffers from high blood pressure so he needs regular medication and City Vets have been a huge help in keeping him healthy."  Foster further stated, "He has plenty of life left in him yet, but I don't think we will go down the Guinness World Record route as I am not sure he would like lots of people coming to see him or a fuss being made out of him. He is old now and would not like too much attention or be hassled. We would prefer if he was just left to live out his old age in peace."  The previous oldest living cat in the Britain—Nutmeg from Tyne and Wear—passed away in September 2017. Rubble has now matched the age of Scooter, a Siamese who also achieved the age of 30 and was recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records. Scooter died in his 30th year.  Rubble's milestone was celebrated with a party at his veterinary physician's office.  He feasted on his favorite food  and treats and received a free check-up. Rubble's longevity is partly due to the fact that Michele never had her own children and pampers him like her child.  The oldest cat in world history according to the record books was Creme Puff, who was born on August 3, 1967, and lived until August 6, 2005—a total of 38 years and 3 days.
