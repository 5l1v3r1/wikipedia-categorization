Corduroy (August 1, 1989 â€“ c. November 2016) was a male domestic cat that held the record as the world's oldest living cat until May 2016.  He was also the oldest cat in 2014, aged 25 years old at the time, until being replaced by Tiffany Two. In August 2015, Corduroy regained the title.  On May 10, 2016, Corduroy was replaced by a 30-year-old Siamese cat named Scooter (born March 26, 1986).  However, Scooter died less than a week after being named the record-holder,  possibly making Corduroy the holder of oldest living cat once again.
