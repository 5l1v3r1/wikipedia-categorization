Tiffany Two (March 13, 1988 – May 22, 2015) was the world's oldest living cat, aged 27 years, according to Guinness World Records.  This distinction is different from the oldest cat ever verified; Creme Puff lived for 38 years, 3 days. Tiffany Two, a tortoiseshell cat, was born in San Diego, California, on March 13, 1988.  She was bought by her owner, Sharon Voorhees, from a pet shop when she was six weeks old. The tortoiseshell feline long outlived two dogs purchased by Voorhees at about the same time.  Tiffany ate both wet and dry cat food and, while mostly an indoor cat, ventured outside from time to time.  Tiffany Two died on May 22, 2015, aged 27, roughly 125 cat years.   The previous official world's oldest living cat was Poppy, from Bournemouth, Dorset, who died at age 24 in June 2014.  It is contended that Missan, a Swedish farm cat, is 29 years old. Åsa Wickberg, her owner, says she found her as a stray kitten in 1985. According to a representative for Guinness, Wickberg has requested the organization declare Missan the world's oldest living cat.  Guinness is waiting for more proof-of-age documents, such as medical records and statements from veterinarians, before ruling on Wickberg’s claim.  On June 4, 2015, Guinness released a statement: "We are currently investigating and verifying the potential successors for the oldest living cat title and will announce this once we’re in a position to do so. We welcome applications for this title on our website."
