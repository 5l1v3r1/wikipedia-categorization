  Bluey (7 June 1910 â€“ 14 November 1939) was an Australian cattle dog owned by Les and Esma Hall of Rochester, Victoria, Australia. According to Guinness World Records, Bluey lived 29 years, 5 months and is the oldest dog ever verified.   Two owners have made claims for longer-lived dogs Max and Bella, but these claims have not been independently verified.   Bluey's age, along with that of "Chilla," a mixed-breed (Labrador-Australian Cattle Dog) reported to have lived to the age of 32 years and 12 days,  prompted a study of the longevity of the Australian Cattle Dog to examine if the breed might have exceptional longevity. The 100-dog survey yielded a mean longevity of 13.41 years with a standard deviation of 2.36 years.  The study concluded that while the Australian Cattle Dogs do live almost a year longer than most dogs of other breeds in the same weight class on average, the cases of Bluey and Chilla should be regarded as uncharacteristic exceptions rather than as indicators of common longevity for this entire breed.
