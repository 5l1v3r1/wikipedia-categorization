Nutmeg (1986 - August 29, 2017) was a tabby domestic cat, owned by Liz Finlay and Ian Finlay. Nutmeg was born in 1986, making him one of the oldest living cats until his death at age 31 in 2017. However, he wasnâ€™t the oldest cat in the world; Creme Puff (cat) was, at 38 years old.     Despite his long life, Nutmeg did not qualify for Guinness World Records because there is no documentation to prove his age.  Nutmeg's birth date is unknown, but he was said to be around 5 years old when he was adopted in 1990.  Nutmeg suffered a stroke in 2015, but survived after receiving care from a veterinarian.   In August 2017, Nutmeg was taken to Westway Veterinary Group in Newcastle after he began having difficulty breathing. The veterinarians were unable to save him after he suffered heart failure. Westway Veterinary Group, where Nutmeg was treated during his long lifetime, announced his passing on their Facebook page. Video of Nutmeg
