Pneumonia is an illness which can result from a variety of causes, including infection with bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites. Pneumonia can occur in any animal with lungs, including mammals, birds, and reptiles. Symptoms associated with pneumonia include fever, fast or difficult breathing, nasal discharge, and decreased activity.  Different animal species have distinct lung anatomy and physiology and are thus  affected by pneumonia differently. Differences in anatomy, immune systems, diet, and behavior also affects the particular microorganisms commonly causing  pneumonia. Diagnostic tools include physical examination, testing of the  sputum, and x-ray investigation. Treatment depends on the cause of pneumonia;  bacterial pneumonia is treated with antibiotics.
