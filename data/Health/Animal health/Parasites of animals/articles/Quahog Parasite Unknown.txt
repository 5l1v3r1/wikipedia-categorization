The quahog parasite unknown, or QPX, is a parasite in the protist kingdom. It affects hard clams, or quahogs,  both cultured and wild.  Parasites similar to QPX were first observed in New Brunswick, Canada, in 1959. Outbreaks have also occurred in Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Virginia, always only in quahog clams. The life stages of thalli, endospores, and sporangia have been observed.   QPX was originally considered a chytrid, but has now been provisionally assigned to the phylum Labyrinthulomycota in either the families Thraustochytriidae or Labyrinthulidae, based on the organism having a "uninucleate biflagellate zoospore stage, a loose multilaminar cell wall, and particularly an intracellular sagenogen-like structure".  However, much about it is still unknown.  QPX-like organisms also may not be all of the same species.  Symptoms of QPX include chipping of the shells, mantle swelling, stunted shell growth and the development of nodules.
