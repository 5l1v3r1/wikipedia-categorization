Willi A. Kalender (born August 1, 1949) is a German Medical Physicist and Professor and Chairman of the Institute of Medical Physics of the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg.  He is a Fellow of the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) and Honorary Fellow of the British Institute of Radiology (BIR) and of the Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine (IPEM). Willi Kalender started his studies in physics and mathematics at the University of Bonn, Germany. He completed his Master’s and Ph.D. degree in Medical Physics at the University of Wisconsin in 1974 and 1979, respectively. In 1988 he completed all postdoctoral lecturing qualifications (Habilitation) at the University of Tübingen, Germany. In order to get a better grasp of the subject, he took and successfully completed all courses in the pre-clinical medicine curriculum. From 1979 to 1995 Dr. Kalender worked in the research laboratories of Siemens Medical Systems in Erlangen, Germany; he was appointed head of the Medical Physics group in 1988.  In 1995 he was appointed full Professor and Chairman of the newly established Institute of Medical Physics at the Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuremberg, Germany. In 1999 he became Distinguished Visiting Professor to the Department of Radiology at Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. Willi Kalender has conducted research mainly in the area of diagnostic radiology imaging with a clear focus on special CT applications. The goals of and motivation for his projects were mostly derived from observations during patient exams in clinical radiology. Outstanding results were the development of the world’s first product options for dual-energy CT   in 1983 and for metal artefact reduction (MAR)   in 1987. The development and introduction of volumetric spiral computed tomography was a highlight of his work; the world’s first clinical spiral CT studies were presented at RSNA 1989   and were highly welcomed. The combination of continuous data acquisition with slip-ring-based data transmission and continuous table translation led to considerable reduction of examination times, to an essential reduction of motion artefacts and image quality significantly improved by providing isotropic spatial resolution as a decisive feature. The development of a number of new and advanced applications such as angio-CT   and heart phase-specific cardiac imaging   followed and became a big success. Other highly important fields of W. Kalender’s research have been radiation protection and the development of intelligent and very efficient dose reduction approaches such as tube current modulation   and the optimization of the choice of x-ray spectra  . They allow reducing the patient dose by an order of magnitude in many cases without impairing image quality. An overview of all measures he introduced is given in  . Presently, Willi Kalender’s research focusses on the development of an efficient breast-CT system to improve the early detection of breast cancer  . The scanner and in particular the development of its high-resolution photon-counting detector design allow scanning the breast with a dose similar to that of digital mammography, but with much higher resolution and clarity than mammography due to superposition-free fully 3D-resolution of breast-CT  . The introduction into clinical practice is expected for 2018 and should become another success story. In the course of his prolific career Willi Kalender has founded a number of university spinoff companies to transfer scientific results into products and small business. In recognition of his contributions to the field of medical imaging Willi Kalender has received a number of prestigious awards.
