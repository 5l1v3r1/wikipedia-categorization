It was founded in 1916.  The Society's original mission was to further "the scientific study of radium in relation to its physical properties and therapeutic applications" distinguishing it from the American Roentgen Ray Society (ARRS). The society's mission was expanded in 1950 to include "the treatment of neoplastic and allied diseases and the study and application of ionizing radiation."  In the ensuing years its focus became increasingly multidisciplinary. In 1933, The ARS founded the annual Janeway Lecture in honor of Henry Harrington Janeway, a pioneer in radium therapy. The first Janeway Lecture, "Early Experience in Radium Therapy", was given by the pathologist James Ewing. The lecture is delivered at the society's annual general meeting with the lecturer chosen for their "outstanding scientific contributions". The 2014 Janeway Lecturer was Murray F.

Aikins, known as the founder of radiotherapy in Canada.  Other past presidents have included:
