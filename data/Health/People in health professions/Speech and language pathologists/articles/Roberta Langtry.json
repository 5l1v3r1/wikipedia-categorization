She had been a modest supporter of NCC's work since 1999.\n</p><p>While she was alive, she made a number of large, anonymous gifts to individuals she knew who were in need. Recipients would receive envelopes from an unknown benefactor in the amounts of $25,000 or $30,000. Her friends and coworkers were unaware of her wealth.\n</p><p>Langtry was born in <a href=\"/wiki/Manitoba\" title=\"Manitoba\">Manitoba</a>. She began teaching around the age of 16. Most of her 55 years as a <a href=\"/wiki/Teacher\" title=\"Teacher\">teacher</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Speech_therapist\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Speech therapist\">speech therapist</a> were with the East York Board of Education. She never married and had no children. Langtry lived in her aunt's modest <a href=\"/wiki/Bungalow\" title=\"Bungalow\">bungalow</a>, sharing it with her aunt until she died in the early 1990s and living alone until she died herself. <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.natureconservancy.ca/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;id=5401&amp;news_iv_ctrl=0&amp;abbr=on_ncc_\">[1]</a>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sources_of_Wealth\">Sources of Wealth</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Roberta_Langtry&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Sources of Wealth\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Langtry may have earned a modest side income via her development of a number of puzzle-based <a href=\"/wiki/Educational_games\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Educational games\">educational games</a>, that were sold in the <a href=\"/wiki/United_States\" title=\"United States\">United States</a>. In 1960, she co-authored <i>Teacher's guide to accompany Creative English, grade four</i> with J.D. Hanmer (Vancouver&#160;: Copp Clark Pub.
