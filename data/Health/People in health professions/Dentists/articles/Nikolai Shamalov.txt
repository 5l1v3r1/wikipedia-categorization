Nikolai Terent'yevich Shamalov, Nikolai Terent'evich Shamalov or Nikolai Terentievich Shamalov (Russian: Николай Терентьевич Шамалов;born January 24, 1950, Belarus) is a dentist, a Russian businessman, and a founding member of Ozero.  His nickname is Professor Filip Filippovich Preobrazhensky (Russian: Профессор Филипп Филиппович Преображенский) or the “Professor of the Transfiguration,” who was the central character that transforms from a stray dog into a New Soviet man in Mikhail Bulgakov’s Heart of a Dog.  Shamalov is a dentist/physician by training.  He is fluent in German.  Until the 1990s, Nikolai Shamalov worked as a dentist in Leningrad.  In 1994, he founded the company Masterdentservis (Russian: «Мастердентсервис») in Leningrad.  Nikolai Shamalov was a representative of Siemens in St. Petersburg from 1992-2008 selling medical equipment for Siemens Medical Systems.    According to Sergei Kolesnikov, Shamalov refused to answer questions by Siemens internal investigators about money laundering, corruption, and bribery.[a] This led to Shamalov's dismissal from Siemens.    From 1993 to 1995, he worked in the Committee on External Relations of the St. Petersburg Mayor's Office. Vladimir Putin was his boss.  [b] In January 1992, AOZT/ZAO Petromed was founded with 51% of its shares owned by the Saint Petersburg's Committee on External Relations (KVS) which Putin headed, 39% of its shares owned by the Center for International Cooperation which is headed by Dmitri Gorelov, and 10% of its shares owned by the Saint Petersburg Committee on Health.  Andrey Kolesnikov, a biophysicist from the Polytechnic Institute, formed a cooperative to manufacture medical equipment for Petromed.  In 1993, Nikolai Shamalov was hired by Putin as the Petromed's purchasing agent for Siemens medical equipment from Germany instead of buying from Kolesnikov's cooperative's Russian manufactured equipment.  Over many years, Petromed received state funds for the purchase of medical equipment, but Putin also demanded that Russian oligarchs make charitable contributions to Petromed for the purchase of medical equipment.    However, Shamalov greatly inflated the purchase price of the medical equipment and then funneled 33% of the money to offshore accounts.     After Vladimir Yakovlev, who was the Governor of Saint Petersburg, became a very outspoken critic of Petromed, Putin, and coruption, Gorelev and Kolesnikov bought out the Saint Petersburg Committee on Health portion of Petromed and became the only two owners of Petromed.  Later, Gorelov, Kolesnikov, and Shamalov used the funneled money, which they obtained as overcharges to Petromed, to purchase shares in Rossiya Bank, Vyborg Shipyard, and other entities.    On November 10, 1996, he was a founding member of Vladimir Putin's closed gate community, the cooperative Ozero.        As of 2016, Shamalov has remained a member of the cooperative Ozero.  In 2004, he, Yuri Kovalchuk, and Dmitry Vladimirovich Gorelov became co-owners of Bank Rossiya.  Shamalov has the second largest stake in Bank Rossiya.  On October 18, 2005, he, Sergei Kolesnikov, and Gorelov founded Rosinvest. [c] Using money that Shamalov had funneled from Petromed to offshore accounts[d] and money that was from the Russian state treasury, this company built the health resort in Gelendzhik known as "Putin's Palace" which was part of "project south" (Russian: Проекту Юг).       To finance "Putin's Palace", Nikolai Shamalov's expertise in selling medical equipment through Siemens in St Petersburg was essential in obtaining several hundreds of millions of dollars out of the $1 billion intended for Russian healthcare improvements.  Nikolai Shamalov is the original legal owner of "Putin's Palace."  In 2006, he became a co-owner with a controlling share (10%) of Vyborg Shipyard.    Dmitri Gorelov's son Vasili Gorelov is another owner of Vyborg Shipyard.  In 2010, he, his son Kirill, and Oleg Vitalyevich Sharykin (Russian: Олег Витальевич Шарыкин) became co-owners of the Russian Cement Company (Russian: Русскую цементную компанию (РЦК)).[e] Nikolai owns a 12.5% share. Kirill owns a 5% share and is on the board of directors. The Shamalov's combined stake is estimated to be 15 billion rubles in 2018.    In 2011 to support the Russian Defense Ministry, Roscosmos, and ROSATOM,[f] he and Oleg Sharykin formed the joint company Ceramic Technologies (Russian: совместную компанию "Керамические технологии")[g] which has two main projects: (1) the creation of silicon carbide pencil boxes for the long-term storage and disposal of highly radioactive nuclear waste in underground sites and (2) the development and production of silicon carbide optical blocks in telescopes and sensors used in remote sensing surveillance satellites, which also can detect asteroid hazards and explore deep space.  Ceramic Technologies is a member of the Lebedev Institute of Physics (FIAN) through the Troitsk Technopark (Russian: Троицкий технопарк ФИАН)  and the Skolkovo Foundation but receives no investment and no funding from either.  Also, Sharykin said that we have in Kemerovo "Khimprom" (Russian: "Химпром") and PO "Tokem" (Russian: "Токем"), which competes with Lanxess, Dow Chemical, and Mitsubishi Chemical for monodisperse copolymers in resin ion exchangers for nuclear reactors at nuclear power plants, nuclear powered ships (both icebreakers and submarines), and water treatment in the chemical and metallurgical industries.  As of October 2015, ROSATOM purchases 40% of its needs for resin ion exchangers from NATO countries, but the Kemerovo production sites are expected to meet 100% of ROSATOM needs by 2017.  On June 28, 2013, he was the second largest shareholder in Bank Rossiya owning around 10.5% of the total shares.   According to the Panama Papers, his Bank Rossiya staff in St Petersburg sent all their confidential instructions through a firm of Swiss attorneys in Zurich, Dietrich Baumgartner and Partners, to have Mossack Fonseca (Mossfon) establish a British Virgin Islands shell company, Sandalwood Continental Ltd, to hide large sums of Vladimir Putin's personal wealth that had been in bank accounts at the Russian Commercial Bank (RCB) of Cyprus, which is a bank owned by VTB and is now known as RCB Bank.      [h] Some of this money was transferred from Sergei Roldugin's Sandalwood Continental Ltd to Ozon LLC[i] to purchase and develop the Igora ski resort.  [j][k] According to Sergei Kolesnikov, Nikolai Shamalov gives Vladimir Putin updates on the status of Putin's offshore wealth and hidden accounts usually two or three times a year.  His relationships with various entities and individuals and be found in this image  In 2011, he was listed as the 198th richest Russian with a wealth of $500 million by Forbes.  He is on the billionaires (rubles) group with Delovoy Peterburg.  Because of the ongoing Russian interference in Ukraine and Nikolai Shamalov's close personal relationship's with Vladimir Putin, Nikolai Shamalov has been under sanctions by the European Union since July 30, 2014, Liechtenstein since July 31, 2014, Canada since August 2, 2014, Switzerland since August 27, 2014, Australia since September 2, 2014, and Ukraine, since October 17, 2016.       These sanctions both freeze his assets in the European Union, Liechtenstein, Switzerland, Ukraine, Canada, and Australia, and also restrict his travel rights.   Nikolai Shamalov has two sons. Yuri Shamalov (b. June 10, 1970, in St. Petersburg) worked under Vladimir Putin and with Yuri's father Nikolai on the foreign economic relations committee (KVS) for the city of Saint Petersburg from October 1993 to October 1995.   He was a Siemens sales representative for Moscow from February 1997 to July 2003.   He was the first vice president for Gazfond from July to August 2003.

Yuri Shamalov has degrees from the Higher Naval Engineering College V. I. Lenin in 1992 in naval engineering and from the All-Russian Academy of Foreign Trade of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations of the Russian Federation in 1996 in foreign trade.  Kirill Shamalov (b. March 22, 1982, in St. Petersburg) is a deputy chairman on SIBUR's management board, a vice-president of Sibur Holding,[m] which is a Russian gas processing and petrochemicals company headquartered in Moscow, and was married to Katerina Tikhonova from 2013 to 2018.
