Cooper has written a children's book that is available for purchase from Amazon,  either in paper or Kindle form.   The book is "The Secret. Period." and chronicles the story of two sisters as the eldest gets her first period.  When the older sister gets her first period, she keeps it secret from her little sister and the little sister feels left out and lonely, but she doesn't know why her sister isn't talking to her.  The story offers a brief explanation of menstruation, but is more broadly a book that has menstruation as part of the story, thus giving parents and older siblings a way to break taboos around menstruation and converse about it more openly.
