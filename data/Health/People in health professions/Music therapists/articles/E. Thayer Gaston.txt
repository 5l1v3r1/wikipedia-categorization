Everett Thayer Gaston (July 4, 1901 – 1970) was a psychologist active in the 1940s–1960s who helped develop music therapy in the United States,  describing the qualities of musical expression that could be therapeutic. He worked at the University of Kansas, as Professor of Music Education and Director of Music Therapy. He was named to the Music Educators Hall of Fame in 1986.  He outlined three principles (values) that are a primary source of direction for the use of music in therapy: The values are further explained in Gaston's book "Music in Therapy".
