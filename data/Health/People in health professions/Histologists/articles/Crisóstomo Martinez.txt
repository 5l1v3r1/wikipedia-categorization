Crisóstomo Martinez (1638–1694) was a Valencian painter and engraver known for his atlas of  anatomy. His work has been ascribed to the Spanish intellectual movement called "Novator" which refers to the timid beginnings of a scientific revolution in the Kingdom of Spain in the late seventeenth century. The most innovative aspect of his work was an interest in embryology and microscopy, which he applied to the study of "fresh" osteology.
