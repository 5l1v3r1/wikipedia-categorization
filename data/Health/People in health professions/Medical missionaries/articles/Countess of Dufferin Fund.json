During Beilby\u2019s mission, she had treated the Maharani of Puna who gave her a message to relay to the Queen of England.  The message said that \u201cthe women of India suffer when they are sick.\u201d  In response, Queen Victoria wrote back to the Maharani saying: </p><style data-mw-deduplicate=\"TemplateStyles:r856303468\">.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}</style><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p>\u201cWe had no idea it was as bad as this.

The Countess of Dufferin Fund is also known as \u201cThe National Association for Supplying Medical Aid to the Women of India\u201d and the \u201cLady Dufferin Fund.\u201d  This Fund marked one of the first diplomatic pushes to improve global health in the world, and the introduction of western medicine for women in India.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Forbes_3-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Forbes-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Fund.E2.80.99s_goals\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Fund\u2019s_goals\">Fund\u2019s goals</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Countess_of_Dufferin_Fund&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Fund\u2019s goals\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The Fund had three primary goals: providing medical tuition, medical relief, and female nurses and midwives to assist in hospitals and private homes.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Billington_4-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Billington-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>  The Fund supplied scholarships for the medical education (medical tuition) of women in India.  The education of traditional Indian midwives, called dias, was a major goal of the Fund because many western doctors observed the dais\u2019s practices and found their traditions to be harmful.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Guha_5-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Guha-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>  For example, the dais\u2019s would massage the abdomen of the mother to speed up labor however that tradition caused <a href=\"/wiki/Uterine_prolapse\" title=\"Uterine prolapse\">uterine prolapse</a>, a widespread issue amongst Indian women at the time.  Because the dias\u2019 methods were viewed as violent and extremely harmful, the Fund put forth money to educate them on successful ways to help women before, during, and after childbirth.  The Fund also provided medical relief by establishing dispensaries and cottage hospitals for women and children under female superintendence.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Billington_4-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Billington-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>  In addition, it opened female wards in existing hospitals also under female management as well as all women hospitals called <a href=\"/wiki/Zenana_missions\" title=\"Zenana missions\">zenana</a> hospitals.

Many of the hospitals the Fund financed are still functioning today.  For example, the <a href=\"/wiki/Lady_Dufferin_Hospital\" title=\"Lady Dufferin Hospital\">Lady Dufferin Hospital</a> in Karachi is the largest solely female dedicated hospital today in Pakistan.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Funding_and_Administration\">Funding and Administration</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Countess_of_Dufferin_Fund&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Funding and Administration\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The Fund\u2019s major financial basis was donations.  Many saw this as a source of instability because donations were based on the popularity of Lady Dufferin and her husband as well as the favors expected by the donors in return.  The administration of the Fund consisted of a central committee of members of the Viceroy\u2019s Council and Home Department.  It also included many influential Englishmen and Indians such as the Maharja Sir Jotendro Mohun Tagore, Sir Syed Ahmed Khan, and Sir <a href=\"/wiki/Dinshaw_Maneckji_Petit\" title=\"Dinshaw Maneckji Petit\">Dinshaw Maneckji Petit</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Forbes_3-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Forbes-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Criticism_of_the_Fund\">Criticism of the Fund</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Countess_of_Dufferin_Fund&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Criticism of the Fund\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>There were three major criticisms of the Fund: its teaching, effectiveness, and integrity.  Many believed the Fund was inefficient.  Some argued that they inadequately taught doctors and employed subpar medical practitioners.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Conrad_6-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Conrad-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>  By October 1908, only 43 completely qualified women medical professionals were working under the Fund however only 11 held university degrees.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Vaughan_7-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Vaughan-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> The <a href=\"/wiki/British_Medical_Journal\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"British Medical Journal\">British Medical Journal</a> wrote in 1908 that, \u201cThe Government appears to have a perfect delight in swamping the country with unqualified medical practitioners.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-Vaughan_7-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Vaughan-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>  The Fund was also criticized as ineffective for placing male doctors in Zenana hospitals.  Zenana women\u2019s traditions forbade them from seeing, so they could be treated by the doctors the Fund provided.  In addition, the Fund was also criticized for not giving the women they were educating enough reason to stay with learning medicine.  The Fund paid for their education however their salaries were not high enough so it made more financial sense for the women to marry before they could give back to the hospital that educated them.  The Fund set up this cycle of educating women who would then work for them, however, it was ineffective in some cases because the women would not stick with the medical profession for financial reasons.  Because of the many criticisms of ineffectiveness, some of the Fund\u2019s highest critics like The British Medical Journal called for a reorganization of the Fund.  Some also believed vanity, not philanthropy, was the source of motivation for establishing the Fund.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Conrad_6-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Conrad-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>  They criticized both Lady Dufferin for starting the Fund for her personal image and Queen Victoria for supporting the Fund for Britain\u2019s international image.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"After_Lady_Dufferin\">After Lady Dufferin</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Countess_of_Dufferin_Fund&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: After Lady Dufferin\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The Fund continued even after Lady Dufferin\u2019s term ended.

In 2005 a bill was passed repealing the Countess of Dufferin\u2019s Fund Act, 1957, for unclear reasons.<sup id=\"cite_ref-GOVERNMENT_8-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-GOVERNMENT-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Notable_employees\">Notable employees</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Countess_of_Dufferin_Fund&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10\" title=\"Edit section: Notable employees\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Margaret_Ida_Balfour\" title=\"Margaret Ida Balfour\">Margaret Ida Balfour</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Kadambini_Ganguly\" title=\"Kadambini Ganguly\">Kadambini Ganguly</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Florence_Dissent\" title=\"Florence Dissent\">Florence Dissent</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Countess_of_Dufferin_Fund&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-Abraham-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\">^ <a href=\"#cite_ref-Abraham_1-0\"><sup><i><b>a</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Abraham_1-1\"><sup><i><b>b</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Abraham_1-2\"><sup><i><b>c</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Abraham_1-3\"><sup><i><b>d</b></i></sup></a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Abraham, Meera.
