 Captain John Todd, MBE, MC, DFC (1899â€“1980) was a Scottish First World War flying ace credited with eighteen aerial victories.  Todd was a medical student at Edinburgh University  before he joined the Royal Flying Corps as a cadet. He was commissioned as a temporary second lieutenant (on probation) on the General List on 2 August 1917,  and was confirmed in his rank on 3 November.  He was posted to No. 70 Squadron RFC to fly the Sopwith Camel single-seat fighter, and scored his first victory on 22 January 1918. Further victories followed, and Todd had brought his score up to five by the end of March, to make him an ace.  On 1 April 1918, the Royal Flying Corps was merged with the Royal Naval Air Service to form the Royal Air Force, and his unit became No. 70 Squadron RAF. He gained three more victories by the end of the month,  and on 7 May he was appointed a flight commander with the acting rank of captain.  As such he gained six more victories in May, three in June, and his eighteenth and last on 1 July 1918.  His final total was ten enemy aircraft destroyed (two shared), seven driven down out of control (one shared), and one captured. Fourteen of them were fighters and four were reconnaissance aircraft.  Todd was posted back to the Home Establishment in Britain to serve as an instructor in July 1918.  On 3 August his award of the Distinguished Flying Cross was gazetted,  followed by his Military Cross on 16 September.  On 5 January 1919 he was transferred to the RAF's unemployed list.  After the war Todd returned to his medical studies. After graduating in 1922, he went to Livingstonia, Nyasaland, as a medical missionary.  His efforts were rewarded by being made a Member of the Order of the British Empire in the 1955 Birthday Honours "for medical and missionary services in Northern Rhodesia."
