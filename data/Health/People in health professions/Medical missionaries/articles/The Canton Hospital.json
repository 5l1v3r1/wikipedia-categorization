Canton was the only city in China where foreigners were allowed to set foot, thereby making it the only place where European and Chinese merchants could trade. Its location next to the <a href=\"/wiki/Pearl_River_(China)\" title=\"Pearl River (China)\">Pearl River</a> also made it ideal for international trade, as all ships used for trade were forced to travel along this river in order to arrive at the <a href=\"/wiki/Port_of_Guangzhou\" title=\"Port of Guangzhou\">Port of Canton</a>. <sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> Additionally, it was a major stop along the <a href=\"/wiki/Silk_Road\" title=\"Silk Road\">Silk Road</a>, and is still a major port and city for transportation today. Canton was also surrounded by a major wall, which isolated it from the rest of the general population. Overall, because Canton was the only city in China that was open to foreign trade, <a href=\"/wiki/Medical_missions_in_China\" title=\"Medical missions in China\">medical mission</a> work was made possible here and spread more easily.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:194px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Peter_Parker.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Peter_Parker.jpg/192px-Peter_Parker.jpg\" width=\"192\" height=\"270\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Peter_Parker.jpg 1.5x\" data-file-width=\"200\" data-file-height=\"281\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Peter_Parker.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Portrait of Dr. Peter Parker</div></div></div>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Dr._Peter_Parker\">Dr. Peter Parker</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=The_Canton_Hospital&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Dr. Peter Parker\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/Peter_Parker_(physician)\" title=\"Peter Parker (physician)\">Peter Parker</a> was an <a href=\"/wiki/Americans\" title=\"Americans\">American</a> Protestant medical missionary. Before travelling to China, he attended <a href=\"/wiki/Yale_University\" title=\"Yale University\">Yale University</a> for postgraduate work in theology and medicine. However, his main goal in travelling to China was not to practice medicine; instead, it was to save the Chinese from idol-worshipping and introduce them to <a href=\"/wiki/Protestantism\" title=\"Protestantism\">Protestantism</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Christianity\" title=\"Christianity\">Christianity</a>. He first began work in the hospital by treating diseases in the eye because he was told it would be the fastest way to gain the trust of the Chinese. Because many of the natives regarded all foreigners as barbarians, it was important for Parker to gain the natives' trust in order to perform medicine on them and introduce them to Christianity. \n</p><p>Eventually, Parker found so much joy in treating patients that he ultimately committed himself to becoming a full-time doctor, instead of a part-time <a href=\"/wiki/Evangelism\" title=\"Evangelism\">evangelist</a> and part-time doctor like he had originally planned. <sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> During his twenty years of work in China, Parker treated over 50,000 patients. In the later years of his life, he became a fervent promoter of medical missions and played an instrumental role in increasing their importance and popularity.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"History_of_the_Hospital\">History of the Hospital</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=The_Canton_Hospital&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: History of the Hospital\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>On November 4, 1835, Peter Parker opened the Canton Hospital, which was the first Western-style hospital in China.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> Parker, the first full-time Protestant medical missionary, opened the hospital in connection with the mission of the <a href=\"/wiki/American_Board\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"American Board\">American Board</a> after <a href=\"/wiki/Thomas_Richardson_Colledge\" title=\"Thomas Richardson Colledge\">Dr. Thomas Richardson Colledge</a>, a Christian surgeon of the <a href=\"/wiki/East_India_Company\" title=\"East India Company\">East India Company</a>, convinced existing Protestant mission societies of the need for a hospital in China. Colledge strongly believed that Christians were required to help the sick in China, and as a result, pushed Parker, his mentee, to open a hospital in Canton.\n</p><p>Under the support of the American Board and Canton businessmen, the hospital was the first and most famous charitable missionary hospital in <a href=\"/wiki/South_China\" title=\"South China\">South China</a> at the time. When Parker opened the hospital, it was first only intended for the treatment of eye illnesses and was opened as an \u201cEye Infirmary.\u201d This helped Parker gain trust with the Chinese, but it was also practical because of patients' needs at the time. In many areas, Chinese medicine was not extremely far behind <a href=\"/wiki/Western_medicine\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Western medicine\">western medicine</a>, but because they were not as advanced in eye medicine, there was a high prevalence of eye diseases during this time. Throughout the first three months of the hospital being open, 1061 patients were treated, and 96.1% of those had ocular illnesses.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> The hospital quickly proved to be very successful, and after the first year, 2,910 patients were treated. Soon after the hospital opened, Parker was asked to treat ear illnesses in addition to eye illnesses. This led to him finding a number of patients with <a href=\"/wiki/Tumors\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Tumors\">tumors</a>, and he was forced to perform surgery on these patients, which were almost always successful. As soon as others heard of Parker\u2019s success, patients with all different types of illnesses and diseases wanted to come to the hospital for treatment. As a result, Parker soon found it impractical for the hospital to only treat eye illnesses, and it then opened up to all different types of <a href=\"/wiki/Diseases\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Diseases\">diseases</a>.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:318px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Birds_eye_view_for_the_Canton_Hospital.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Birds_eye_view_for_the_Canton_Hospital.jpg/316px-Birds_eye_view_for_the_Canton_Hospital.jpg\" width=\"316\" height=\"240\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Birds_eye_view_for_the_Canton_Hospital.jpg/474px-Birds_eye_view_for_the_Canton_Hospital.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Birds_eye_view_for_the_Canton_Hospital.jpg/632px-Birds_eye_view_for_the_Canton_Hospital.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"978\" data-file-height=\"742\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Birds_eye_view_for_the_Canton_Hospital.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>A birds eye view of the Canton Hospital.</div></div></div>\n<p>Eventually, the hospital became so well known and in demand that it had to turn away patients because it became too much for only one physician. The hospital\u2019s Chinese name, Pok Tsai, means Universal Helpfulness, which shows that everyone knew that the hospital would serve all classes in the community, Chinese and foreign.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> In order to stay open, Parker depended on support from missionary colleagues and local business firms and merchants (especially Chinese merchant How-Qua). Because he didn\u2019t charge for his services, he relied on their money to stay open. In addition, this hospital also led to Western-style medical education in China, when Parker and <a href=\"/wiki/Elijah_Coleman_Bridgman\" title=\"Elijah Coleman Bridgman\">Dr. E.C. Bridgman</a> trained three young Chinese men to help out in the hospital. However, it was not until 1866 that the first western-style medical school, the Boji Medical School, was established in the hospital. This medical school was run by missionaries, and is now part of the <a href=\"/wiki/Sun_Yat-sen_University_of_Medical_Sciences\" title=\"Sun Yat-sen University of Medical Sciences\">Sun-yatsen University of Medical Sciences</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In 1840, the <a href=\"/wiki/First_Opium_War\" title=\"First Opium War\">First Opium War</a> led to hostilities between <a href=\"/wiki/England\" title=\"England\">England</a> and China. During the war, the port of Canton was blockaded and all foreigners were forced to leave, causing the Canton Hospital to be temporarily shut down. Near the end of the war, China was forced to accept <a href=\"/wiki/Treaties\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Treaties\">treaties</a> that required them to open their borders to foreigners. As a result, missionaries were now allowed to do work in all of China (not only in Canton like before the war). In 1842, Parker returned to Canton with his wife, Harriet Webster (who was the first Western woman to be granted residence in China), and reopened the hospital. <sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> It remained under the control of the Medical Missionary Society until 1930, when it became part of <a href=\"/wiki/Lingnan_University_(Guangzhou)\" title=\"Lingnan University (Guangzhou)\">Lingnan University</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Functions_of_the_Hospital\">Functions of the Hospital</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=The_Canton_Hospital&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Functions of the Hospital\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The hospital\u2019s main goals included the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, the distribution of free <a href=\"/wiki/Vaccines\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Vaccines\">vaccines</a>, and plague treatments. Because the hospital was built by Parker in conjunction with other Protestant medical missionaries, <a href=\"/wiki/Philanthropic\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Philanthropic\">philanthropic</a>-minded <a href=\"/wiki/Physicians\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Physicians\">physicians</a> were very prominent at the hospital. As a result, it was also involved in areas outside of the treatment of diseases, including medical education, <a href=\"/wiki/Research\" title=\"Research\">research</a>, social service work, and promoting <a href=\"/wiki/Public_health\" title=\"Public health\">public health</a> to the surrounding community. It cooperated with the Chinese government and many social organizations to develop school health, <a href=\"/wiki/Maternal\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Maternal\">maternal</a> and child health, and communicable disease control. The hospital was also built on a three-level medical system, which provided a model for the establishment of the Chinese rural medical system.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Legacy\">Legacy</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=The_Canton_Hospital&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Legacy\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The Canton Hospital is one of the most influential missionary hospitals in South China. Not only was it the first hospital that brought the concept of public health to the city of Canton, but it is also sustainable, as it still exists today as one of the most prestigious ophthalmic institutes in the world. Throughout its time open, the hospital set many records in Chinese medical history, including being the first western medicine school in China, and producing the first Chinese medicine magazine and the first x-ray film. <sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> It also produced the hospital's best student, <a href=\"/wiki/Sun_Yat_Sen\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sun Yat Sen\">Sun Yat Sen</a>, who became the first president of China. <sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>\nIn addition, the Canton Hospital gave explicit expression to the concept of medical missions for the first time. In 1838, it led to the creation of the <a href=\"/wiki/Medical_Missionary_Society_of_China\" title=\"Medical Missionary Society of China\">Medical Missionary Society in China</a>, a Protestant medical missionary society established in Canton, which was dedicated to promoting religious missions and gaining the trust of the Chinese through medical care, instead of through preaching. In 1898, Parker\u2019s successor, <a href=\"/wiki/John_Glasgow_Kerr\" title=\"John Glasgow Kerr\">John Glasgow Kerr</a>, founded The Asylum for the Insane in Canton, which was the first institution in China dedicated to the mentally ill.<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> This was a direct result of the hospital\u2019s success, and shows the impact that it had on public health and medicine in China.\n</p><p>Today it is the <a href=\"/wiki/Sun_Yat-sen_University#Affiliated_hospitals\" title=\"Sun Yat-sen University\">Second Affiliated Hospital</a> of <a href=\"/wiki/Sun_Yat-sen_University\" title=\"Sun Yat-sen University\">Sun Yat-sen University</a>.
