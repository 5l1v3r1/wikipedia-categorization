After returning, he received his undergraduate degree from Allegheny College in 1932.  Completing his medical training at Harvard Medical School in 1936,  Hammon then studied with the bacteriologist Hans Zinsser, receiving a Master of Public Health degree in 1938, and a Doctor of Philosophy degree in 1939.  During this period Hammon co-discovered the first vaccine for feline panleucopenia.  Hammon was presented with the Medal of Freedom in 1946 by President Harry Truman.
