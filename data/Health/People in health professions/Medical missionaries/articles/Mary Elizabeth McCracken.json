She was pulled everyday to school in a long wagon by her mother. As Mary Elizabeth had to be carried to class and recess, her mother often had to be present to perform such a duty.\n</p><p>After the family moved to the United States in 1920, it was a challenge to find a school for Mary Elizabeth to attend. Only when a druggist from the neighborhood allowed an employee to carry Mary Elizabeth was she able to finally attend a school.<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> Eventually, in 1924, she went to the Watson Home in <a href=\"/wiki/Pittsburgh\" title=\"Pittsburgh\">Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania</a> for both treatment and schooling.

Her sisters helped wheelchair and carry her during these times. The college faculty was very interested in Mary Elizabeth and her attitude towards learning. Mary Elizabeth developed a liking for history, learned how to swim, and joined archery during college.\n</p><p>After graduating from Lake Erie College, Mary Elizabeth went on to study at the <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania\" title=\"University of Pennsylvania\">University of Pennsylvania</a>.

With a physician as a father and physical therapist as a mother, Mary Elizabeth was not left alone to tackle this disease. Her entire family including her brothers and sisters took part in helping Mary Elizabeth move from place to place. During college at <a href=\"/wiki/Lake_Erie_College\" title=\"Lake Erie College\">Lake Erie College</a>, her older sisters Helen and Margaret carried her throughout the day across campus to her classes.<sup id=\"cite_ref-auto_1-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-auto-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Initially after Mary Elizabeth was struck with this disease, her mother did her best to treat her but this was not enough.

In 1916, Mary Elizabeth and her father traveled to Boston so she could receive care to straighten her back.\n</p><p>In February 1919, Mary Elizabeth began to go to the Red Cross Hospital in Shanghai to receive electrical treatments three times per week. She had to be brought home early to rest before every treatment, thus, she had to leave school early for each treatment.<sup id=\"cite_ref-20\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-20\">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup> Though Mary Elizabeth broke her leg in December 1919, she still persisted in attending school in her cast. In February 1921, the family made the hard decision to send Mary Elizabeth to the Watson Home for crippled children in <a href=\"/wiki/Pittsburgh\" title=\"Pittsburgh\">Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania</a> to receive care under Dr. David Silvers.<sup id=\"cite_ref-auto8_13-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-auto8-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup> This is where she ended up for her entire high school career. Though the family returned to Shanghai on June 23, 1921, Mary wasn\u2019t able to improve in Shanghai and made the decision to return in the Summer of 1923 to the Watson Home.<sup id=\"cite_ref-auto7_9-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-auto7-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In 1934, Mary Elizabeth attended <a href=\"/wiki/Medical_school\" title=\"Medical school\">medical school</a> and was able to use her own <a href=\"/wiki/Rickshaw\" title=\"Rickshaw\">rickshaw</a> and coolie.<sup id=\"cite_ref-21\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-21\">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup> This allowed for greater independence for her as she went to school and made new friends. Being the \u201cindomitable Mary,\u201d she was an independent person, never letting others perform any task for her if she could do it herself. Her entire family treated her like a normal child and despite her handicap, she was always welcomed in different settings due to her warm and friendly personality. Such traits were key to her success, allowing the title of the first female to overcome infantile paralysis to become a medical missionary.<sup id=\"cite_ref-auto_1-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-auto-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Mission_Work\">Mission Work</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Mary_Elizabeth_McCracken&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Mission Work\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Motivation_for_Medical_Missions\">Motivation for Medical Missions</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Mary_Elizabeth_McCracken&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Motivation for Medical Missions\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Mary Elizabeth was born into the medical missionary setting in Shanghai as her parents were medical missionaries themselves.<sup id=\"cite_ref-auto1_2-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-auto1-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> With such an upbringing, Mary Elizabeth was able to see all the facets of the missionary life. She didn\u2019t just view the missionary life from a distance but she herself was actually impacted in many ways by this lifestyle. Her life was split between time in Shanghai and the United States. She became used to being apart from her parents when she was seeking education in the United States while her parents stayed in Shanghai to serve. She knew that her parents wouldn\u2019t be able to make it to many important life events including her graduation or the weddings of her siblings.<sup id=\"cite_ref-auto_1-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-auto-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Despite all this, she understood the importance of her parent\u2019s roles and the impact that the \"McCrackens of Shanghai\" had.

Though this was a lofty goal, she did not let her paralysis hinder her. She took up challenges and obstacles with one goal in mind: to serve the children in Shanghai. To Mary Elizabeth, her fight against infantile paralysis transformed from a part of her that she had to deal with into a trait she could overcome or even leverage to become the medical missionary she hoped to be for the Chinese children.<sup id=\"cite_ref-auto_1-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-auto-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Service_in_Shanghai\">Service in Shanghai</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Mary_Elizabeth_McCracken&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Service in Shanghai\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>After Mary Elizabeth\u2019s internship at the Refugee Hospital, she stayed one more year to work in the <a href=\"/wiki/Pediatrics\" title=\"Pediatrics\">pediatrics</a> department.<sup id=\"cite_ref-auto_1-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-auto-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> By this time, she practically ran the entire pediatrics department at the hospital.<sup id=\"cite_ref-auto2_4-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-auto2-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> During the Sino-Japanese War, she worked with the Red Cross to gain access to powdered milk for the refugee babies she took care of.

After her time at the Children\u2019s Hospital, she hoped to return to China to serve the children in Shanghai. Returning to China was harder now because the Chinese had just banned \u201call women and useless men.\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-auto3_5-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-auto3-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> Despite this, Mary Elizabeth was determined to return.\n</p><p>By seeking out her father\u2019s second cousin, Dr. Henry Noble McCracken, president of <a href=\"/wiki/Vassar_College\" title=\"Vassar College\">Vassar College</a> whom had relations with <a href=\"/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt\" title=\"Franklin D.
