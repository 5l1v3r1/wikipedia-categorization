She served as a <a href=\"/wiki/Medical_missions_in_China\" title=\"Medical missions in China\">medical missionary in China</a> under commission from the Methodist Episcopal Board of Missions from 1908 to 1950 alongside her husband Rev. Francis Gale, a <a href=\"/wiki/Christian_mission\" title=\"Christian mission\">religious missionary</a>. Committed to a lifetime of unpaid social activism, Gale's work emphasized an approach to patient care that focused on preventative care and public health, humane treatment, and consideration for the whole patient, entailing concern for physical, spiritual, and intellectual needs. She also had <a href=\"/wiki/Evangelicalism\" title=\"Evangelicalism\">evangelical</a> motives and sought to promote the status of Chinese women.\n</p><p>Gale's years of service in China coincided with major political developments of the time, including the <a href=\"/wiki/Chinese_Civil_War\" title=\"Chinese Civil War\">Chinese Civil War</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Second_Sino-Japanese_War\" title=\"Second Sino-Japanese War\">Second Sino-Japanese War</a>, Sino-American alliance during <a href=\"/wiki/World_War_II\" title=\"World War II\">World War II</a>, and implementation of a <a href=\"/wiki/Communism\" title=\"Communism\">Communist</a> government. The political and cultural climates created by these events had a great impact on Gale's work both in determining the needs she was to respond to and in influencing interactions between the Gales and the Chinese populations they served.\n</p><p>Gale kept active correspondence with her supporters back in the American home field. As a female surgeon in the twentieth century who wrote about her medical successes and spoke at public events, Gale broke into fields dominated by men in the twentieth century\u2014medicine and public speaking\u2014and gave credibility to women's capability for professionalism and leadership. Her readers were encouraged to consider women as active players in the international realm rather than solely restricted to the <a href=\"/wiki/Separate_spheres\" title=\"Separate spheres\">domestic sphere</a>. At the same time, historians have noted Gale's role in uplifting upper-middle class white Protestant women at the expense of Chinese women, whose religious practices (or lack thereof) and non-Western medicine she considered inferior.\n</p><p>Gale returned to New York in 1950 and died in 1958 at the age of 79.\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Background\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Background</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Early_life\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Early life</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Education\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Education</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Personal_life\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Personal life</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Medical_Missionary_Work_in_China\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Medical Missionary Work in China</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#Call_to_Mission_Work\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Call to Mission Work</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#Nanchang,_Kiangsi:_1908-21\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Nanchang, Kiangsi: 1908-21</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#Tunki,_Anhwei:_1923-27\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Tunki, Anhwei: 1923-27</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-9\"><a href=\"#The_Shanghai_American_School:_1927-33\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">The Shanghai American School: 1927-33</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-10\"><a href=\"#Nanking:_1933-39\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Nanking: 1933-39</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-11\"><a href=\"#Tzechow,_Tzechung:_1941-47\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Tzechow, Tzechung: 1941-47</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-12\"><a href=\"#Nanchang:_1947-50\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.7</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Nanchang: 1947-50</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-13\"><a href=\"#Legacy\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Legacy</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-14\"><a href=\"#Correspondance_with_Supporters\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Correspondance with Supporters</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-15\"><a href=\"#Women&#39;s_Roles_in_America\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Women's Roles in America</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-16\"><a href=\"#Role_in_Sino-American_Relations\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Role in Sino-American Relations</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-17\"><a href=\"#Honors\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Honors</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-18\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Background\">Background</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Ailie_Gale&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Background\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Early_life\">Early life</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Ailie_Gale&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Early life\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Ailie Gale was born in 1878 in <a href=\"/wiki/Bozeman,_Montana\" title=\"Bozeman, Montana\">Bozeman, Montana</a> to Moses Harrison Spencer, a <a href=\"/wiki/Methodism\" title=\"Methodism\">Methodist</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Circuit_rider_(religious)\" title=\"Circuit rider (religious)\">circuit rider</a> and dentist, and Elizabeth Spencer.

Although her husband received a salary that she did not, Francis Gale himself recognized and was often involved in Ailie's work. He was one of her most vocal supporters.\n</p><p>Together, they raised four children, three sons and an adopted Chinese daughter, Mary Gao Chen. Gale found Mary abandoned at the gate of the Nanchang Hospital as a one-month-old. While Mary was raised as Christian, Mary's upbringing also emphasized her Chinese identity as she was taught the Chinese language and wore traditional clothes.<sup id=\"cite_ref-:2_1-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:2-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> Gale impressed upon her from childhood the importance of her future role in serving the Chinese people and the precedence public service work took over marriage.<sup id=\"cite_ref-:2_1-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:2-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> Mary grew up to become a nurse working in public health, expressing interest in Chinese politics as well as showing talent as a leader and administrator.<sup id=\"cite_ref-:0_2-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:0-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Medical_Missionary_Work_in_China\">Medical Missionary Work in China</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Ailie_Gale&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Medical Missionary Work in China\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Call_to_Mission_Work\">Call to Mission Work</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Ailie_Gale&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Call to Mission Work\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Although Gale received her medical degree, she did not take state board examinations, determined to utilize her medical skills in the mission rather than in America. Additionally, opportunities for medical work were scant for women in America, who faced discrimination in the male-dominated field; Gale was one of only 4 women in her graduating class from Cooper Medical College.<sup id=\"cite_ref-:0_2-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:0-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-:2_1-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:2-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> China, on the other hand, had many opportunities for women physicians on account of the Manchu abdication of 1911 and new Republican government's recognition of Western medicine after the North Manchurian Plague of 1910 and 1911, and a dire dearth of physicians that left Chinese communities underserved.<sup id=\"cite_ref-:5_3-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:5-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> Nevertheless, there still existed some conflict over the imposition of Western medicine over traditional Chinese healing practices.<sup id=\"cite_ref-:5_3-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:5-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Gale's mission work was also driven by a desire to spread Christianity, and especially to empower women through Christianity, rather than professional gain.

Here, Gale held three positions at Methodist institutions. She worked as chief administer at the Nanchang General Hospital until 1922, the only physician available to serve thirty hospital beds and two outside dispensaries until 1920, the year she finally had a Chinese physician join as her assistant.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> She was also the school physician and industrial class teacher for the Stephen L. Baldwin Memorial Girls' School starting in 1910 and provided medical services for the Women's Foreign Missionary Society's Women and Children's Hospital. In addition to overseeing and performing most of the medical work and surgical operations in each location, Gale also made house calls. All social classes were accounted for: treatment for the poor was free, financed by fees to upper-class patients.\n</p><p>She also served as a role model for female independence \"the rapidly growing numbers of modernized Chinese women\" as Chinese women \"began their fight for a public role in the new democracy\" and built a close relationship with the women she served.<sup id=\"cite_ref-:0_2-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:0-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> She further encouraged interaction through invitations to eat dinner with \"interesting Chinese guests\" in published letters in Woman's Missionary Friend.<sup id=\"cite_ref-:1_7-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:1-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Tunki.2C_Anhwei:_1923-27\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Tunki,_Anhwei:_1923-27\">Tunki, Anhwei: 1923-27</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Ailie_Gale&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Tunki, Anhwei: 1923-27\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>After returning home to complete postgraduate medical courses at Columbia Medical College, the Gale family again arrived in China in the Tunki area in 1923 with three male nurses trained by Gale in Nanchang. The Board had commissioned Rev. Gale to continue evangelical work and Dr. Gale to take over medical work.<sup id=\"cite_ref-:0_2-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:0-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Gale's time in Tunki was characterized by two major complications: lack of funding and rising anti-foreign sentiment in China. By the 1920s, post-WWI disillusionment as well as financially stressed Protestant churches had contributed to the loss of interest in missionary work. As a result, funding from Methodist Episcopal Church Board became scarce, even threatening to force the Gales to leave their missionary post in Tunki altogether. However, Gale took advantage of the increasingly important relationship she had with supporters in the home field and was able to continue medical work, including building the Tunki General Hospital, relying solely upon monetary donations and gifts. Her letters became even more emphatic in relating how vital these gifts were as well as the gratitude of Chinese patients. She also raised money from local Chinese contributions and medical fees to wealthier patients.<sup id=\"cite_ref-:0_2-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:0-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The rise of anti-imperialist and anti-Christian sentiment and protests as a result of the growing Chinese Nationalist Movement antagonized the relationship between missionaries, seen by many as representatives of Western domination, and the local Chinese population. However, Gale was able to evade attack because of her connections with a local government school, hiring graduates as nurses and befriending Buddhist teachers and students there. This relationship extended military protection over the Tunki Hospital, where Gale treated both Southern and Northern soldiers. Gale had the full support of Tunki officials, receiving a Merit Board from military officials, soldiers, and the police commissioner as they asked the Gales to remain in Tunki.<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Gale ran a self-directed and self-administered public health campaign starting in 1925 with malaria as its main target issue. Putting a spin on the nationalist \"kill the Japs\" pamphlets widely distributed by students at the time, Gale and her nurses handed out \"kill the fly\" pamphlets.<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> The campaign culminated in a week of public health in May 1926 with health parades of school children, nurses, and religious workers carrying banners and Chinese national flags, sanitation lectures held by hospital representatives, and musical entertainment. It was widely popular among Tunki residents, and attendants included the police force and members of the Chamber of Commerce. The campaign was seen as a great success, both educating and encouraging enthusiasm among the Tunki population. Afterwards, wire screen covers were manufactured by the Tunki population and widely used in candy and fruit shops as protection against mosquitoes.<sup id=\"cite_ref-:0_2-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:0-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Shanghai_American_School:_1927-33\">The Shanghai American School: 1927-33</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Ailie_Gale&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: The Shanghai American School: 1927-33\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In April 1927, the American Consulate ordered an evacuation from Tunki in response to escalating anti-foreign sentiment and the potential for violent attacks. The Gales, along with over 75,000 other foreigners, moved to Shanghai where Ailie Gale became a physician and preceptress at the Shanghai American School.\n</p><p>The missionary station in Tunki was eventually closed by the Board in December 1931 due to lack of funding, exacerbated by the worldwide depression.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Nanking:_1933-39\">Nanking: 1933-39</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Ailie_Gale&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10\" title=\"Edit section: Nanking: 1933-39\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>During her time in Nanking, Methodist missionary objectives shifted to emphasize the economic and social needs of rural China rather than evangelical efforts in response to the deteriorating economy. Gale continued her work in a holistic approach to preventative health at two clinics, established by herself, and Ginling College, established by women's Baptist, Methodist, and Presbyterian societies to \"offer special courses in premedical sciences, in education,\" and \"in religion, fitting women students for service in the three fields of ministry to the needs of body, mind and spirit\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> Gale was satisfied with her placement in the College as it, with its faculty and Nationalist government backing, promoted education in order to empower a more active public role for women. Here, she held a public health clinic, once performing three hundred physical exams within one week. In addition to her role as a physician, Gale was also an educator and saw herself as a role model who collaborated with her students on public health projects and invited them to her home for meals.\n</p><p>Gale became closely associated with the Nationalist movement through her interest in the social programs for rural Chinese populations proposed by the <a href=\"/wiki/New_Life_Movement\" title=\"New Life Movement\">New Life Movement</a> and a friendly relationship with George Shepherd, one of the main Western advisors of the movement appointed by <a href=\"/wiki/Chiang_Kai-shek\" title=\"Chiang Kai-shek\">Chiang Kai-Shek</a>.

Her responsibilities included overseeing women's clinics, nurses in the hospital, and religious work. As the hospital was struggling from lack of funding and nurse shortages upon her arrival, she also took on a role managing finances and taking on duties usually filled by nurses with some of the infant patients there. She worked towards a goal of restoring the hospital's reputation and establishing trust between the hospital and the populations it served. She was also concerned with making medical care more accessible for the poor.<sup id=\"cite_ref-:0_2-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:0-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>To these ends, Gale was successful in renovating the hospital and nurses' quarters as well as acquiring modern technology such as an x-ray machine and ultimately in attracting more patients to the Chadwick Hospital. She also began a half-time day school for poor Chinese children in 1942 and set up a \"poor fund\" that allowed the hospital to provide services to those who could not pay.

During these later years of service, she suffered from illness and an infected kidney; nevertheless, she continued work and ran the boys' clinic, seeing about 200 boys daily, and raised funds for medical supplies.\n</p><p>Throughout her years in China, Gale had protested Communism for its opposition to religion, as a Methodist and believer in Christian social activism herself, and for its rule that everyone must work to eat, as she believed that the most needy of society needed to be considered in a different light.

Further credibility was given through the frequent commendations she received from both Chinese and missionary men for her work.

Gale often expressed a horizontal, rather than a vertical or hierarchical, worldview that while Christians of all genders and races were superior to non-Christians, Chinese and Westerners, like men and women, should work side by side. These assertions were understood by women supporters, as the language mirrored that of nineteenth-century Protestant women missionary workers who had subverted male power by asserting their obligation to serve God alongside their male counterparts. ...Despite this...Gale was a cultural imperialist in her unwavering insistence that the Chinese needed to replace their religious beliefs with Christianity, a Western import. While professing the need for cooperation, she consistently placed herself in a position of power, where she delegated, rather than accepted, orders to both white and Chinese men and women. Gale did not question her own nation's, or Western political dominance over China in general.</p><div class=\"templatequotecite\">\u2014&#8201;<cite>M.
