Muhadhdhib al-Dīn Abūʼl-Hasan ʻAlī ibn Ahmad Ibn Hubal (Arabic: مهذب الدين أبي الحس علي بن أحمد ابن هبل‎) known as Ibn Hubal (Arabic: ابن هبل‎) (c. 1122 - 1213) was an Arab physician and scientist born in Baghdad.  He was known primarily for his medical compendium titled Kitab al-Mukhtarat fi al-tibb (Arabic: كتاب المختارات في الطب‎), "The Book of Selections in Medicine."  It was written in 1165 in Mosul, north of Baghdad, where Ibn Hubal spent most of his life. The popular medical encyclopedia is highly dependent upon the Qanun of Ibn Sina (Avicenna),  with occasional passages transcribed verbatim. The chapters on kidney and bladder stones were edited and translated into French by P. de Koning in his Traité sur le calcul dans les reins et dans la vessie (1896).  Other chapters have been translated by Dorothee Thies in Die Lehren der arabischen Mediziner Tabari und Ibn Hubal über Herz, Lunge, Gallenblase und Milz (1968).
