Alexander Gordon (1752-1799) was a renowned Edwardian obstetrician best known for being the first person to describe the infectious nature of childbirth fever in his paper of 1795 entitled Treatise on the Epidemic Puerperal Fever of Aberdeen.   His remarkable paper gave insights into the contagious nature of puerperal fever more than half a century before Ignaz Semmelweis and before the science of bacteria was known about.   Gordon was born in 1752 in Strachan, Scotland. He studied medicine at the University of Aberdeen's Marischal College.
