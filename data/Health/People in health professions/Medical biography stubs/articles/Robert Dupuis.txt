Following his return to Canada in 1964, he continued his post-graduate studies, completing them in 1965; at which time, he was posted to the Canadian Forces Hospital in Kingston, Ontario as Assistant Chief of Medicine. He remained in the position until 1966, when he was posted to the Military Hospital in Gatineau, Québec. He was posted there for a brief period of time before being posted to the Military Hospital in Accra, Ghana as a specialist.   Dupuis returned to Canada in 1968 and was posted to the National Defence Medical Centre (NDMC) in Ottawa, Ontario as Assistant Chief of Medicine, and the following year, he was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel. He remained in the position until 1972; at which time, he was appointed Chief of Medicine. In 1973, Dupuis was promoted to Colonel. He was also appointed assistant professor at the University of Ottawa within the medical school that year, and associate professor the following year.  He was next promoted to Brigadier-General in 1979 and appointed Commandant of NDMC. He remained in the position until 1982; at which time, he was promoted to Major-General and appointed Surgeon General.  Dupuis retired from the military in 1985, and became a civilian Medical Specialist for NDMC, a position he held until his full retirement in 1995.
