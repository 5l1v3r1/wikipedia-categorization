Abascantus (Greek: Ἀβάσκαντος) was a physician of Lugdunum, who probably lived in the 2nd century AD.  He is several times mentioned by Galen,  who has also preserved an antidote invented by him against the bite of serpents.   The name is to be met with in numerous Latin inscriptions in Grutor's collection,  five of which refer to a freedman of Augustus, who is supposed by some scholars to be the same person that is mentioned by Galen.  This, however, is quite uncertain, as also whether Parakletios Abaskanthos (Παρακλήτιος Ἀβάσκανθος) in Galen  refers to the subject of this article.
