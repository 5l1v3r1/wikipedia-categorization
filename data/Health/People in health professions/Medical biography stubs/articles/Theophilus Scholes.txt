Rev. Dr Theophilus Edward Samuel Scholes (pseudonym Bartholomew Smith) (c. 1858â€“c. 1940) was a Baptist missionary, medical doctor and political commentator. Scholes was born in Jamaica and qualified as a doctor in Scotland. In 1903 he published a critique of Joseph Chamberlain, the British Colonial Secretary who had proposed colonial policies whose benefits were only available for white British subjects. On the contrary, Scholes argued, Africans and those of African descent could make important contributions to progress if they were not subject to such artificial constraints.
