Ibn Butlan (Arabic: ابن بطلان‎; 1038,  1075) was an Arab Nestorian Christian physician who was active in Baghdad during the  Islamic Golden Age. He wrote the Taqwim al-Sihhah (The Maintenance of Health).  The work treated matters of hygiene, dietetics, and exercise. It emphasized the benefits of regular attention to the personal physical and mental well-being.  The continued popularity and publication of this medieval text of Middle Eastern origin into the sixteenth century is thought to demonstrate the influence that Arabic culture had on early modern Europe.   One of his Greek sources was Dioscorides.
