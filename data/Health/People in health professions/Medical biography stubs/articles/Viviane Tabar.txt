Viviane Tabar, MD, is an American neurosurgeon and Chair of the Department of Neurosurgery at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York.   Tabar took her medical degree from the American University of Beirut. It was followed by a neurosurgical residency at the University of Massachusetts. She did postdoctoral work at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.  Having done a research fellowship at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Tabar joined the faculty. At present, she is the Theresa C. Feng Chair for Neurosurgical Oncology and the Vice Chair for Neurosurgical Research and Education.  She is also the founding Director of the Multidisciplinary Pituitary and Skull Base Tumor Center at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.   Tabar’s specialty is intraoperative brain mapping techniques.  Her research is in stem cell biology, and she is one of the leaders of the New York State consortium for the development of human embryonic stem cell–derived dopamine neurons for Parkinson’s disease.  She has devised strategies for cell-based therapies for the repair of radiation-induced brain injury. Her lab has used pluripotent stem cells for brain tumor modeling, resulting in novel insights into the biology of gliomas and to the discovery of candidate therapeutic targets for brain tumors.  A prolific author, she has written dozens of widely-cited publications.  Tabar is a member of many societies including the National Academy of Medicine, the American Society for Clinical Investigation, the Society of Neurological Surgeons, the American Association of Neurological Surgery, and the American Brain Tumor Association.
