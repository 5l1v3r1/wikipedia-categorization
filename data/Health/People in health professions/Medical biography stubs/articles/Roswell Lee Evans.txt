Roswell Lee Evans, originally from Georgia, is the current Dean of the Harrison School of Pharmacy at Auburn University  and an alleged expert on the use of the benzodiazepine, midazolam for carrying out the death penalty. Beginning in April 2015, Evans' credibility and qualifications as an expert witness became heavily criticized when the case of Glossip v. Gross.  went before the Supreme Court of the United States of America. At this time, it was revealed that over 150 pages of his report he provided in his testimony came directly from the consumer website Drugs.com.     Many have also criticized Evans’ opinion as an expert on midazolam due to his testimony regarding of the mechanism of action of benzodiazepines. Evans testified that; “Midazolam attaches to GABA receptors, inhibiting GABA… that's what generates the clinical effect or the pharmacological effect from midazolam and all the other benzodiazepine drugs” and further stated “GABA receptors are responsible for anxiety disorders. So when you basically inhibit GABA, you basically begin to control those kind of symptoms”.  These statements drew criticism as they describe the exact opposite of benzodiazepines, which actually work by enhancing the effect of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) at the GABAA receptor. By enhancing the effects of GABA, benzodiazepines use results in sedative, hypnotic (sleep-inducing), anxiolytic (anti-anxiety), anticonvulsant, and muscle relaxant effects.
