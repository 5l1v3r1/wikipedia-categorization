Johan "Lets" Pretorius (b. 1946) is a medical doctor from Mokopane, South Africa as well as a right-winger who allegedly belongs to the Boeremag, an irredentist organization. He is married to Minnie Pretorius and has three sons Johan, Kobus and Wilhelm who allegedly also belong to the Boeremag.  He was arrested on 15 September 2002 when he was found with a truck laden of weapons and explosives in Lichtenburg. Along with his three sons, he became one of the defendants in the Boeremag treason trial.  During cross-examination in this trial, on 26 April 2010 his son Johan claimed that he was not a criminal, but had been a soldier for the "Boerevolk" and thus should be treated as a prisoner of war. Presiding Judge Eben Jordaan rejected this application several months later on 21 August.
