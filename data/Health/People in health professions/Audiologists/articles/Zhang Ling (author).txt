Ling Zhang (Chinese: 张翎; born in 1957) is a senior audiologist and fiction writer in Toronto, Canada. She was born in Wenzhou, China and came to Canada in 1986 to pursue her MA in English at University of Calgary. She obtained her second MA degree in Communication disorders at the University of Cincinnati. She has published eight novels and several collections of novellas and short stories in Chinese. One of her novels, 《金山》, has been translated into English, French, and German. She has won numerous important literary prizes in China. In 2009, Zhang's novella, Aftershock (2010 film), a tale about the survival of the horrific 1976 Tangshan earthquake, was made into China's first IMAX movie, directed by Feng Xiaogang. This movie became the greatest box office success  at the time and has grossed more than US$100 million at the Chinese box office.  In 2011, a lawsuit of six millions was launched against Zhang Ling for allegedly plagiarizing from works by Wayson Choy, Paul Yee, and SKY Lee. However, the case was closed in the early 2015 with no judgement against either of the parties.
