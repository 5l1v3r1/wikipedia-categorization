Daniel Steven Peña Sr.   (born August 10, 1945), also known as Dan Peña, is an American businessman and business coach. He resides at Guthrie Castle in Scotland, in which he previously operated a wedding business.  He received a Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration from California State University, Northridge (CSUN) in 1971.  Peña received the Latin Business Association's award for Outstanding Business Owner in 1981.  In September 2017, he was appointed by Queen Elizabeth II as a "Serving Brother" to the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of St John of Jerusalem, also known as "The Order of St John".  Peña was the founder and chairman of The Guthrie Group,  an investment consortium, incorporated on the Channel Islands in 2002.  He also founded a company called iZone-iHUB, which ran a hackathon with the stated purposes of allowing start-ups the ability to develop their ideas and pitch products for potential investment.      In March 2006, an Indian software engineer alleged that Peña, Peña's wife, Sally Hall, and employee Bill William Smith , had deceived him and stolen credit card details from illegal proxy websites that they operated. Smith was arrested in Bangalore and all three were charged under the Information Technology Act of 2000.  In August 2009 the cyber crime police in India told the I ACMM court that it was a "mistake of facts" and the court officially acquitted him of all charges.  [additional citation(s) needed]
