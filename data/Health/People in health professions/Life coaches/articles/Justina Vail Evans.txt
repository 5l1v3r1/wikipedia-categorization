 Justina Vail Evans (n√©e Vail, previously credited as Justina Vail) (born 20 August 1963) is a British actress, life coach, author and hypnotherapist.  Vail was born in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in 1963 to British parents. She acquired her first acting role in Hong Kong where a British television show was filming.  Professionally, Vail's most notable role was as a Russian scientist Dr. Olga Vukavitch in the late 1990s and early 2000s UPN science fiction television series Seven Days. Vail received positive reviews for her performance on the show.  In 2000, she won a Saturn Award for best supporting actress, winning out over Stargate SG-1's Amanda Tapping.  In 2001, however, there were reports of dissatisfaction on set. Co-star Don Franklin expressed his dissatisfaction with the show,  and Vail was reported to have left the show entirely  (according to some show sources over a dispute with Seven Days co-star Jonathan LaPaglia ), only to later return and finish the third season.  Vail also guest-starred in an episode of Highlander: The Series. The episode (along with several others like it) were attempts to pilot female immortal leads for the short-lived Highlander: The Raven. Reviews of the episode were mixed, offering criticism of Vail's character, but not her performance. Ultimately, Vail's character was not the one chosen for the new show.  Vail is married to Jeff Evans, a doctor, leadership development consultant and best-selling author based in Los Angeles, California.  Vail is also an author. She is a recurring columnist for Backstage magazine,  and she has published the book How to be a Happy Actor in a Challenging Business: A Guide to Thriving Through it All. It was awarded the top prize of the "How To" category for the 2012 Hollywood Book Festival.
