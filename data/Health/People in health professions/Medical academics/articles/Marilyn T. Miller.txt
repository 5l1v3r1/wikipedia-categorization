Marilyn Miller is an American pediatric ophthalmologist specializing in the diagnosis and treatment of congenital eye diseases and  strabismus.   She has held leadership positions in her field, often as the first female in those positions. Miller graduated from the University of Illinois School of Medicine  in 1959, and subsequently completed her internship, ophthalmology residency and fellowship in pediatric ophthalmology at University of Illinois Hospital.  She was a student of strabismus expert Eugene R. Folk.  Miller received her B.A. in microbiology from Purdue University in 1954 and M.S. in the same subject from the University of Illinois in 1966. Miller's contributions include descriptions of ocular findings in Möbius syndrome, Parry–Romberg syndrome, and fetal alcohol syndrome.  She described associations of Duane syndrome with craniofacial abnormalities, as well as dyslexia, thalidomide toxicity, and other first-trimester anomalies.  In the 1990s, her study of eye motility problems in people affected by thalidomide contributed to research into the causes of autism.  During her long career, Miller became known particularly for her interest in international ophthalmology.  Along with administrative and educational work in this area, she has cared for thousands of patients around the world, and particularly in Nigeria.  Dr. Miller has been recognized for decades of care provided to children.  She was the first female to serve as president of the American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus,  and also the first female board member of the American Academy of Ophthalmology.
