His father, John Thomson, was a farmer and the family lived in a remote country area which Thomson described as a \"wilderness\". Both of his parents were Unitarians.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>From a young age he became curious about the various plants which he saw growing in the countryside and their medicinal uses. Much of his early knowledge was acquired from a local widow woman, who had acquired a reputation as a healer because of her skill with herbal remedies. Thomson also used to sample the plants he found growing in the wild\u2014in this way he discovered <a href=\"/wiki/Lobelia\" title=\"Lobelia\">Lobelia</a>, which became an important remedy in the system of medicine he later founded. Unaware of the medicinal properties of the plant, Thomson used to trick other boys into eating it, which caused them to vomit because of its emetic nature.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Lloyd_2-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Lloyd-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tleft\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Samuel_Thomson,_creator_of_the_Thomsonian_system._Original.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Samuel Thomson, creator of the Thomsonian system.

Thus, he became resigned to his life as a farm laborer.  At the age of nineteen, while he was chopping wood, his ankle sustained a severe injury which, despite the ministration of a local doctor, refused to heal. His condition worsened and the family feared for his life. He decided to treat the wound himself with a comfrey root and turpentine plaster\u2014after some weeks he was able to make a recovery.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Lloyd_2-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Lloyd-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>At the age of 21, Samuel's father left for Vermont, placing Samuel in charge of the farm and leaving his mother and sister  in his care. Soon after, his mother became ill with <a href=\"/wiki/Measles\" title=\"Measles\">measles</a>, and in spite of the efforts of several doctors, Samuel's mother died when the measles turned into \"<a href=\"/wiki/Galloping_consumption\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Galloping consumption\">galloping consumption</a>\".

After the birth of their first child, Susanna became very ill, and a parade of seven conventional doctors were unable to cure her. Samuel arranged for two \"root doctors\" to treat his wife, who returned to health the next day.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Toadstool_3-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Toadstool-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> Thomson and Susanna went on to have eight children.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Development_of_the_Thomsonian_System\">Development of the Thomsonian System</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Samuel_Thomson&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Development of the Thomsonian System\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>When his wife nearly died after being treated via conventional medicine, Thomson consulted two <a href=\"/wiki/Herbalism\" title=\"Herbalism\">herbalists</a>, who treated his wife and taught Thomson some of their methods.

During the first half of the 19th century his system had numerous followers, including some of his sons. It was based upon opening the paths of elimination so that toxins could be removed via physiological processes. This was not unique to Thomson: so-called \"regular physicians\" used <a href=\"/wiki/Mercury(I)_chloride\" title=\"Mercury(I) chloride\">calomel</a>, a toxic mercury-based compound, to induce vomiting and purgation. Thomson's more moderate and less toxic means attracted large numbers of followers.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Displeased with the conventional medicines and enthusiastic about the results he had had by means of his system, he proposed it as a natural alternative, stating:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p><i>Much of what is at this day called medicine, is deadly poison, and were people to know what is offered them of this kind they would absolutely refuse ever to receive it as a medicine.

He was legally charged by Lovett's father, but Thomson was acquitted when one of his defense counsel demonstrated that one of the prosecution's exhibits, labeled <i>\"Lobelia\"</i>, was actually the plant <a href=\"/wiki/Limonium\" title=\"Limonium\">marsh rosemary</a> (<i><a href=\"/wiki/Limonium\" title=\"Limonium\">Limonium</a></i>), by consuming some in court.

Black laws were labeled as such by unconventional medical practitioners as a way of comparing them with laws restricting African Americans from practicing medicine and engaging in other activities.

In Massachusetts, they began in 1808 to get the Legislature to help them put me down, and in that State and many others, laws have been passed since that time to prevent my collecting my debts, and to make medical practice, without a college diploma, a crime.

Badger, as a Thomsonian physician sailing under false colors, before Judge Thacher</a></i> (1839), where he expressed he was worried about the use other people could do under his name. Partly because of this, he took great care to guard his patented cures, and used legal authority to prevent others from manufacturing and selling lobelia pills, for instance. He sold rights to use his system of medicine to any family for $20.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources.

The tribulations of this former pig farmer rocked the young republic for over a decade and were headlines everywhere. Because of the success of Thomson and his followers, states began, for the first time, regulating medical practice along party and class lines. Messy and fascinating stuff.<sup id=\"cite_ref-19\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-19\">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup></p></blockquote>\n<p>Notably, the eclectic herbalist <a href=\"/wiki/John_Uri_Lloyd\" title=\"John Uri Lloyd\">John Uri Lloyd</a>, in his introduction to the edition of <i>Life and medical discoveries of Samuel Thomson</i>, states that Thomson was involved in <a href=\"/wiki/William_Morgan_(anti-Mason)\" title=\"William Morgan (anti-Mason)\">William Morgan</a>'s Anti-masonic controversy in New York, and argues that he was thus persecuted in part for political reasons:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>One can not now easily enter into the problems of that day concerning medicine and the practice of medicine. The passion, the dogmatism, the vituperation of the period, the suppression of free thought and investigation outside authority, is a something that can not now be expressed or readily appreciated... he was involved by Mr. Locke in the famous Morgan Masonic controversy, the raging in New York. This leads us to state than a share, and possible no small proportion, of Thomson's troubles, came also from his pronounced political activity, at a time when in American politics no toleration whatever was exhibited by one party for an adherent of the opposite political faith... Thomson's allegiance to the minority party of that date led to much of his persecution.<sup id=\"cite_ref-20\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-20\">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup></p></blockquote>\n<p>Thomson's system, however, was still well received by people like <a href=\"/wiki/William_Renwick_Riddell\" title=\"William Renwick Riddell\">William Renwick Riddell</a> in Canada;<sup id=\"cite_ref-21\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-21\">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup> his main work passing through 13 editions, and also finding German advocates who translated his main work into the German language.<sup id=\"cite_ref-22\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-22\">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Thomson's ultimate position about his own system was stated four years before his death, when he wrote:\n</p>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r856303468\"/><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p>I have devoted most of a long life to reducing to a safe and simple practice a system of medical treatment, that should remedy the evils with which mankind has been afflicted to an incalculable amount, ever since the introduction of mineral poisons in the fifteenth century, which have ever since, formed the materia medica of the regular doctors, as they are called, and which are given to cure sick men, though sure to kill well ones if administered to them...But I wish, while living, to see my system promulgated, if at all, in its <i>purity</i>, and when dead, handed down through others who will preserve it, and not let it fall back again into the pernicious practices that have so long plagued the world under high-sounding names of learned quackery. If I am to be remembered at all, for I am past the age of ambition, I want it to be as a benefactor and not as a curse to mankind&#160;; and this depends upon the fact, whether the learned Faculty on one side, from design and malice, and the ignorant Impostors on the other, from love of gain, shall abuse my system, and turn a great good into a great evil, till the people lose all confidence in the genuine by being poisoned by the counterfeit.<br />I trust my life will be long enough to enable me to warn the people against these two rocks, upon which the Thomsonian practice will be in the greatest danger of shipwreck. This has been the sole object of all my warnings, published to guard against impostors. It is no longer a question that this system will be used, but how it will be used, is what most concerns the public.</p><div class=\"templatequotecite\">\u2014&#8201;<cite>Thomson (1839)<sup id=\"cite_ref-23\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-23\">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup></cite></div>\n</blockquote>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Works\">Works</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Samuel_Thomson&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Works\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><i><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://archive.org/stream/0061627.nlm.nih.gov/0061627#page/n7/mode/2up\">New guide to health, or, Botanic family physician&#160;: containing a complete system of practice, upon a plan entirely new&#160;; with a description of the vegetables made use of, and directions for preparing and administering them to cure disease&#160;; to which is prefixed A narrative of the life and medical discoveries of the author</a></i> (1822)</li>\n<li><i><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://archive.org/details/friendtohealthbe00thomrich\">The friend to health&#160;: being a selection of valuable truths relating to the preservation of health from the works of Thatcher, Franklin, Thomson, Salzmann, &amp;c</a> (1826)</i></li>\n<li><i><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://archive.org/details/2575028R.nlm.nih.gov\">Four lectures on the Thomsonian practice of medicine</a></i> (1828)</li>\n<li><i><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://archive.org/details/2568044R.nlm.nih.gov\">A course of fifteen lectures, on medical botany, denominated Thomson's theory of medical practice; in which the various theories that have preceded it, are reviewed and compared; delivered in Cincinnati, Ohio</a></i> (1829)\n<ul><li><i><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://archive.org/details/2568046R.nlm.nih.gov\">A course of fifteen lectures, on medical botany&#160;: denominated Thomson's new theory of medical practice&#160;: in which the various theories that have preceded it are reviewed and compared</a></i> (1832)</li></ul></li>\n<li><i><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://archive.org/details/2575007R.nlm.nih.gov\">A narrative of the life and medical discoveries of Samuel Thomson&#160;: containing an account of his system of practice, and the manner of curing disease with vegetable medicine, upon a plan entirely new</a></i> (1835)</li>\n<li><i><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://archive.org/details/thomsonianmanual01thom\">Thomsonian manual, or, Advocate of the principles which govern the Thomsonian system of medical practice</a></i>.
