Stan Jones (born January 13, 1943) is a Libertarian Party politician who has twice  run unsuccessfully for the United States Senate in 2002 and 2006, and has run twice unsuccessfully for governor of Montana, in 2000 and 2004. The winner in 2000 was Republican Judy Martz, and in 2004 the winner was Democrat Brian Schweitzer. In 2002 the winner was Democrat Max Baucus. His loss in 2006 was his most significant, when he challenged incumbent Republican Conrad Burns and Democrat Jon Tester, and received 3 percent of the vote. Jones developed argyria, which permanently turned his skin a blue-grey color, by consuming home-made colloidal silver, which he made due to fears the Year 2000 problem would make antibiotics unavailable, an event that did not occur. The peculiar coloration of his skin featured prominently in media coverage of his unsuccessful campaign.  Jones continues to promote the use of colloidal silver as a home remedy. His stances on policy issues tend to be socially conservative; among other issues, he supports the death penalty, opposes same-sex marriage despite his party affiliation, and has called abortion a "crime against humanity."   During the senatorial debate held on October 9, 2006, Jones stated that a conspiracy of the European Union and North American elites is on the verge of forming a "one world communist government." He currently works as a business consultant in Bozeman, the seat of Gallatin County.
