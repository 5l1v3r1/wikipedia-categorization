George Washington Carey (1845–1924) was an American physician known for a number of 1910s ‘chemistry of life’ publications, a subject which he referred to as biochemistry, particularly his 1919 The Chemistry of Human Life, all generally using a mixture of religion, astrology, physiology, anatomy, and chemistry, themed particularly with a mineral-based theory of human disease.  Carey is popular among the new-age and homeopathic circles. In the context of a person viewed as a "human molecule", Carey was the first to state that a person’s body is a “chemical formula in operation.”
