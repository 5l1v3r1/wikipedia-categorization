Diana Luke is a Canadian-born radio presenter and hypnotherapist who grew up in Toronto, Ontario and works in the UK. Luke retired from radio on 16 December 2016, to concentrate on her Mind Being Well Workshops for corporate groups around the UK and Clinical Hypnotherapy.  She presented a regular syndicated show broadcast simultaneously on several BBC regional radio stations Sheffield, Leeds, York and Humberside on a Sunday night between 9 pm and 1 am. Some listeners have criticised this move which cuts jobs and means less local output from the BBC. Luke has worked for many radio stations across the country. Her radio career started on Viking Radio in Kingston-upon-Hull in 1987, where she was their first female presenter. She also presented a weekend show on the Yorkshire Radio Network. After leaving YRN, Diana went to County Sound in Surrey as the mid-morning presenter, and later as one of the original presenters on the ill-fated overnight service The Superstation. Diana Luke was the breakfast presenter and first voice heard on London's 102.2 Jazz FM opening day, on Sunday 4 March 1990.  As of  2016[update], she presents a regular show on BBC Radio Sheffield, Leeds, York and Humberside on a Sunday between 9 pm and 1 am. The last hour changes to a pre-recording to The Luke of Love until 1 am. Diana is a regular freelance presenter for BBC Radio Manchester, BBC Radio Leeds and BBC Radio Sheffield. Luke is a professionally qualified clinical hypnotherapist, psychotherapist and health and fitness advisor, and is a member of the National Register of Hypno-Psychotherapists. She also specialises in Mindfulness Workshops for business, education and media sections. Diana Luke is the mother of four adult children and has eight grandchildren to date.
