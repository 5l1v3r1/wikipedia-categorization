Brian Leslie Weiss (born November 6, 1944) is an American psychiatrist, hypnotherapist, and author who specializes in so-called past life regression, a field identified as pseudoscience.    His research includes purported reincarnation, past life regression, future life progression, and survival of the human soul after death. Weiss studied at  Columbia University,  and later graduated from the Yale University School of Medicine in 1970, completing an internship in internal medicine at the New York University Medical Center then returning to Yale  for a two-year residency in psychiatry.  He went on to become Head of Psychiatry, Mount Sinai Medical Center, Miami.   According to Weiss, in 1980 one of his patients, "Catherine", began discussing past-life experiences under hypnosis. Weiss did not believe in reincarnation at the time but, after confirming elements of Catherine's stories through public records, came to be convinced of the survival of an element of the human personality after death.  Weiss claims he has regressed more than 4,000 patients since 1980.  Weiss advocates hypnotic regression as therapy, claiming that many phobias and ailments are rooted in past-life experiences whose acknowledgment by the patient can have a curative effect. Weiss also writes about messages received from the "Masters", or "super-evolved, nonphysical souls", he claims to have communicated with through his subjects.  Weiss holds workshops and seminars across the United States that explain and teach self-regression mediations techniques. This includes the Hay House I Can Do It one day workshops and the intense experiential workshops at the Omega Institute for Holistic Studies in NY. Weiss lives with his wife Carole in Miami, Florida, where he writes and conducts public seminars and workshops on the subject of reincarnation.  His daughter Amy E. Weiss is the co-author of his 2012 book Miracles Happen: The Transformational Healing Power of Past-Life Memories.
