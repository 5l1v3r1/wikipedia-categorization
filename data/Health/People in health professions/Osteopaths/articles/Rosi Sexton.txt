   Associate of the London College of Music (1994)  BA in Mathematics (1st class), Cambridge University (1998)  MSc in Mathematical logic, University of Manchester (2000)  PhD in Theoretical Computer Science, University of Manchester (2004)  Rosemary Ann Sexton (born 16 July 1977) is a mathematician, athlete, sports therapist, osteopath, writer and musician.  She had a career in mixed martial arts (MMA), from which she retired in 2014.      Sexton was born in Versailles, France but moved to Britain at a young age, and grew up and received her education in the United Kingdom. She attended Kendrick School, Reading.  Her father commented "what consistently runs through Rosi’s life is winning: she has a need to win. Her physics teacher said ‘Rosi has a meticulous approach to her studies and nothing short of perfection satisfies her' ".  Sexton was a musician and played with the Reading Youth Orchestra while at school (from 1991 to 1995). She reached grade 7 in cello and grade 8 in piano, then became an Associate of the London College of Music Examinations (piano). In November 1994, aged 17, she played in the Royal Albert Hall, with the Reading Youth Orchestra.  She also played the organ ("though I never got very good"). In 1995, Sexton was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge, where she took a first class degree in mathematics (1998). Her tutor in mathematics was Tim Gowers.  She preferred pure maths: her particular interests were logic, combinatorics and number theory. She then moved to the University of Manchester, where she achieved an MSc in mathematical logic in 2000, The use of the Frame Theoretic Assembly as a unifying construct.   She went on to complete a PhD in Theoretical computer science, A point-free and point-sensitive analysis of the patch assembly.  Her supervisor was Harold Simmons in the School of Mathematics, with whom she wrote a paper, "Point-sensitive and point-free patch constructions", in the Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra.  Sexton had been involved in martial arts since she was at school. She already held dan grades in jujutsu and Taekwondo.  In 2000, after 10 years' experience in martial arts, she decided to train in Mixed Martial Arts and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, as a way of proving to herself that what she had learned was applicable to real life. A clue to the reason for this career change may be found in her comment  "The other things I did, the music, the maths, just weren't quite hard enough"  At the same time, she trained in osteopathy, receiving a degree in that subject from Oxford Brookes University in 2010. She currently practices as an Osteopath in the Manchester area, with a particular interest in sports injuries and evidence-based practice.  She has written about the problem of performance-enhancing drugs (doping) in combat sports, and is a supporter of the Voluntary Anti-Doping Association, VADA.  She is a spokesperson for SafeMMA,  an organisation dedicated to ensuring safety of competitors, and she runs a combat sports injury clinic.  After retiring from MMA in 2014, Sexton did more climbing.  On 27 July 2017, shortly after her 40th birthday, she and Stephen Caudwell climbed the highest artificial climbing wall in the world , Luzzone Dam,  in Switzerland. The climb was sponsored for the benefit of the Mind charity . After successfully completing the climb, Sexton and Caudwell became engaged. There is an account of the climb  , and some videos on YouTube   Sexton made her mixed martial arts debut on 11 May 2002.

Sexton signed an exclusive three-fight contract with Elite XC in June 2008.  She faced Debi Purcell at the 15 August 2008 ShoXC event in Friant, California and defeated Purcell by split decision.  Following the demise of Elite XC, Sexton debuted for Bellator Fighting Championships at Bellator 12 on 19 June 2009. She submitted Valerie Coolbaugh with an armbar in the first round.  Sexton was scheduled to face Angela Magaña at CWFC 37: Right To Fight on 22 May 2010,   but Magana suffered an injury and Sexton was matched against Emi Fujino.  However, due to Sexton's re-signing with Bellator,  her CWFC fight was cancelled.  Sexton faced Zoila Gurgel at Bellator 23 on 24 June.  She was defeated by knockout exactly two minutes into the first round.  As a result of the knockout loss, Sexton was given a 60-day medical suspension and did not compete in the Bellator women's 115-pound tournament.
