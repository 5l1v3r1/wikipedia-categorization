 Dr Elizabeth-Ann Redgrave, Lady Redgrave (n√©e Callaway; born 8 February 1960), is the wife of British rower Steve Redgrave and is a British surgeon and osteopath.  Having taken up the sport in 1981, Redgrave rowed in the women's eight at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. She was Chief Medical Officer to GB Rowing between 1992 and 2001 in a part-time capacity. She became GB Rowing's first full-time Medical Officer in 2009.  She was elected a Steward of Henley Royal Regatta in 2016.  Redgrave qualified as a doctor from Charing Cross Hospital Medical School, London in 1984 and entered a career in orthopaedic surgery, with an interest in sports medicine. However, because of her international rowing commitments, she took a sabbatical in 1988 for the Seoul Olympic Games. During her sabbatical, she developed an interest in osteopathy and thus trained at the British School of Osteopathy following her year out, qualifying in 1990.  In late 1990, she established The Redgrave Clinic in Bourne End, which has since begun to offer a range of other treatments from physiotherapy to the Alexander Technique.  Steven and Ann Redgrave have three children, Natalie, Sophie and Zac. Natalie rowed with the Oxford University Women's Boat Club which won the women's boat race at Henley Boat Races in 2011.    Redgrave has three Honorary Degrees, from Loughborough University in 2001, from the University of Staffordshire in 2004, and from Exeter University in 2010. Upon her retirement as Chief Medical Officer of GB Rowing in 2001, she was awarded the British Rowing Medal of Honour.
