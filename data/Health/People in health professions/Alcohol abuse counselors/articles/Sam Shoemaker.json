Shoemaker then returned to his earlier post at Princeton through the school year, 1922&#8211;23. There, he maintained his ties with the Oxford Group; Buchman also made frequent visits to Princeton. However, by the time Shoemaker returned to Princeton, the movement's personal evangelism had begun to gather both friends and foes in England (where Buchman had started his \"First Century Christian Fellowship\" at Oxford and Cambridge) as well as America.\n</p><p>After completing his missionary year at Princeton, Shoemaker entered <a href=\"/wiki/General_Theological_Seminary\" title=\"General Theological Seminary\">General Theological Seminary</a> in New York. During his second year, Dr. Charles Louis Slattery of <a href=\"/wiki/Grace_Church_(Manhattan)\" title=\"Grace Church (Manhattan)\">Grace Church</a> off lower Broadway appointed him as a part-time assistant. After graduation and ordination, with his bishop's approval, Shoemaker and two British university graduates traveled with Buchman through Europe and the Middle East, exploring the meaning of Christian discipleship in missions and hospitals as they had in Beijing.<sup id=\"cite_ref-17\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-17\">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup> Between Egypt and India Shoemaker received a cable and letter from the vestry at <a href=\"/wiki/Calvary_Church_(Manhattan)\" title=\"Calvary Church (Manhattan)\">Calvary Church (Manhattan)</a>, a then-dwindling but storied missionary congregation in a once-fashionable but changing neighborhood that wanted the energetic youth to become their rector.<sup id=\"cite_ref-18\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-18\">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-19\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-19\">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Bishop <a href=\"/wiki/William_T._Manning\" title=\"William T.

He held outdoor services in nearby Madison Square beginning in the summer of 1927, attracting new parishioners through music as well as his sermons, and began transforming the church school that winter term.<sup id=\"cite_ref-21\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-21\">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>For the next eleven years, Sam and Helen Shoemaker managed to combine the diverse interests of Calvary Church with the life style and program of the Oxford Group. The church's ministry grew exponentially, by about 100 parishioners at the Sunday morning service in his first year, and another 100 during the second.<sup id=\"cite_ref-22\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-22\">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup> However, not all of Calvary's members could have been committed to the radical life style and \"hot gospelling\" of the Oxford Group. Selling some church lots on 22nd Street to build a new seven-story Calvary House in place of the old rectory also caused controversy.<sup id=\"cite_ref-23\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-23\">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In 1926, Shoemaker founded the 'Faith at Work' movement (later called LUMUNOS and Moral Re-Armament in the years immediately preceding World War II) out of his passion for personal witness in the workplace. Faith at Work begun circa 1926 in a mission at Calvary. On Thursday evenings through approximately 1936, lay persons both presented their witness of their life as Christians in the workaday world and were trained to witness to that world.\n</p><p>However, when the Great Depression hit and continued, controversy grew around Shoemaker. In 1932, the Calvary vestry granted him an extended leave of absence to bring his ideas to a wider audience.  \n</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"We must all realize that the work which has been characteristic of Calvary Parish for the past few years is part of a much larger movement which is making a tremendous spiritual contribution in many countries today. A First Century Christian Fellowship or the Oxford Group has been called by Archbishop William Temple of York one of the main movements of the Spirit in our time. \n\"The evident need of our country in the world of spiritual awakening lays a special obligation upon us all at Calvary to share with others what has helped us. \n\"When therefore the Rector asked us to come to a special meeting of the vestry on June 15, and proposed to us that he be released for a six month sabbatical leave during which time he would devote himself entirely to the furtherance of this important work, (with the International Team of the Oxford Group) throughout America, we felt that this was a call which neither he nor we should disregard. Further we wanted him to go as our representative.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-24\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-24\">&#91;24&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Around 1938, Faith at Work transformed into Moral Re-Armament. However, controversy grew because the latter dissociated from Christian churches and New Testament orientation. Moral Re-Armament also took an increasing share of Shoemaker's time and the facilities of Calvary House in New York. Shoemaker re-evaluated his priorities, including with Frank Buchman and the Oxford Group, as well as his commitment to evangelism, devotion to the Church of Christ in general and to the Episcopal Church. Efforts to work through these concerns in 1940 and 1941 proved fruitless. In the closing months of 1941, Calvary Church's vestry formally asked Moral Re Armament to stop using Calvary House.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Pittsburgh\">Pittsburgh</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Sam_Shoemaker&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Pittsburgh\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Shoemaker had become involved in radio preaching, and in 1946, Dr. Frank Goodman of the Federal Council of Churches offered Shoemaker a daily five-minute spot on station WJZ.

The Bishop of Pittsburgh called to urge him to accept, as did a group of Pittsburgers who called themselves the 'Golf Club crowd'.

The early AA got its ideas of self-examination, acknowledgment of character defects, restitution for harm done, and working with others straight from the Oxford Group and directly from Sam Shoemaker, their former leader in America, and from nowhere else.\"</p></blockquote><p>\nAlthough Bill Wilson later said in an address about Shoemaker at the St Louis AA convention in 1955 alongside Father Ed. </p><blockquote><p>\"It is through Sam, that most of our principles have come, that is he has been the connecting link for them, it is what Ebby learned from Sam and what Ebby told me that makes up the linkage between Sam the man of religion, and ourselves. How well I remember that first day I caught sight of Sam, it was a Sunday service in his church. I was still rather gun-shy and diffident about churches. I can still see him standing there before the lectern, and Sam's utter honesty, his tremendous forthrightness, his almost terrible sincerity struck me deep. I shall never forget it.\"</p></blockquote><p>\nShoemaker also addressed an AA group in Charlotte, North Carolina, June 17, 1962 saying:</p><blockquote><p>To set the record straight, that there has gotten going in AA, a kind of rumor, that I had a lot to do with the 12 steps. I didn't have anymore to do with those 12 steps other than that book had, those twelve steps, I believe came to Bill by himself, I think he told me they came to him in about 40 minutes and I think its one of the great instances of direct inspiration that I know in human history, inspiration which doesn't only bring material straight down outta heaven, but brings rather I think from God the ability to interpret human experience in such a way that you distill it down into transmissible principles, I compare it to Moses going up on a mountain and bringing down Ten tables of the Law, I don't think that's the first time Moses ever thought about righteousness, but I'm glad he went up there and got those ten and brought em down and gave em to us. And I'm glad Bill got quiet for those 40 minutes, until he finished off these 12 steps and I believe they have only been changed by about one word. Bill said at the end of this talk \"Who invented AA?, It was God almighty that invented AA, but this is the story of how we learned to be Free.\" And he closed by saying \"God grant that AA and the program of recovery, and unity, and service be a story that continues into the future as long as God needs it.\" Praise be to God for it, and for the life of that fellow and all those who were with him in the beginnings of this incredible movement.</p></blockquote>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Transformation_of_Faith_at_Work\">Transformation of Faith at Work</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Sam_Shoemaker&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Transformation of Faith at Work\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The Thursday evening sessions already alluded to, which were devoted to lay witnesses, provided models for subsequent Faith at Work programs. In it can be traced the lineaments of the \"<i>witnesses</i>,\" still a part of the Faith at Work Conference ministry and of the spate of personal witness articles which appeared in the Calvary Evangel, and the Evangel and have continued in the pages of Faith At Work magazine. The \"<i>Lay Witness Missions</i>,\" now conducted under other auspices than Faith at Work, also had their beginnings in the Thursday evening meetings.\n</p><p>The Thursday night \"<i>witness</i>\" sessions were paralleled by an activity which began in the Calvary House boiler room when the janitor, Herbie Lantau, witnessed to a painter named Bill Levine. They were later joined by Ralston Young, Red Cap #42, from Grand Central Station. Ralston did his witnessing to the people whose baggage he handled and later to groups that gathered for prayer in a car placed in a siding, on Track 13, at Grand Central.\n</p><p>This small group joined some others who were disenfranchised when the split came with MRA in 1942. They and many others met with Irving Harris whose work at the Calvary Evangel and later with its successors covered a period of over three decades. Irving gave structure to the Thursday evening services and was later the enabler of the Monday groups. These were to continue in one form or another until Faith at Work moved to Columbia, Maryland, in 1971.\n</p><p>According to Helen Shoemaker, Sam believed that \"small group action ... always started with personal counseling\" and then continued in the group. This is probably a carry-over from Sam's work in the Oxford Group where conversion or change was the starting point and the group sharing followed. Sam's often repeated triad, \"Get changed, get together, and get going\" also reflects this order. We shall have occasion to return to the topic in a subsequent section. \nAn activity related to the Thursday night \"witness\" services was the work of \"Alcoholics Anonymous.\" AA began under Sam's inspiration and meetings were held every Tuesday night in the Great Hall of Calvary House. The starting points of Faith at Work and AA were similar, although the latter obviously addressed itself to a more particular audience.\n</p><p>\nThe first week-end conference of Faith at Work, the progenitor of hundreds of such conferences to be conducted all over the country, in subsequent years was held at Calvary House in 1943. The means and methods adopted for the conference included: </p><blockquote>\n<p>1) the Conversion of Individuals to Christ; 2) Listening to God; 3) Loyalty to the Church and the Bible; 4) Fellowship, Prayer, and Training Groups; 5) Literature; 6) Impact on Situations; 7) Cooperation between Christian Groups and People. Of these methods, the first, second, and fourth have strong affinities with the procedures of the Oxford Group.\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><b>A Meeting in Print</b>\n</p><p>Faith at Work would probably never have come into existence as an independent movement if it had not been for the growing influence of The Calvary Evangel, later called The Evangel, a magazine of Faith at Work, and still later simply Faith at Work. \nThe Calvary Evangel started out as the monthly church publication of Calvary Church providing both parish information and fairly traditional inspiration from the time of its inception in 1888 until it was taken over by Sam Shoemaker and his friends in 1925. In 1930, Irving Harris became the editor of The Evangel on a part-time basis and from that time until Sam Shoemaker's departure for Pittsburgh at the end of 1951, it reflected faithfully the life style and point of view of its leadership. \nIn 1942, the editor spoke of The Evangel as \"a magazine for life changing and spiritual continuance and a regular means of keeping in touch with one another.\" \nA superficial analysis of the contents of The Evangel in the period 1925-51 suggests that in addition to serving as a newsletter, the magazine provided two kinds of input: \n</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u2022\tstories or witnesses of particular personal experiences of Christ and His power to change lives, and \n\u2022\tpractical but more general and professional input on how to live the Christian life in a more formal and practical way. \nSam Shoemaker's description of the Faith at Work magazine is apt for this period of the organization's life: \nFaith at Work is not a popular \"how to get ahead\" manual. It is not concerned with offering faith as the key to wealth, popularity, and success. It makes no attempt to prove that through faith life can be made easy; rather it tries to make clear that through faith at work life can be made great. Faith at Work is a meeting in print.\"\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Books\">Books</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Sam_Shoemaker&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Books\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Shoemaker wrote over thirty books, about half of which were circulating before A.A.\u2019s 12 Steps were first published in the Big Book in 1939.
