James Newberger (born March 6, 1964) is a Minnesota politician and member of the Minnesota House of Representatives. A member of the Republican Party of Minnesota, he represents District 15B in central Minnesota. Newberger attended St. Cloud State University, graduating with a B.A. in political science and mass communications.  Newberger was first elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in 2012. In April 2015, he drew criticism for statements made on the Minnesota State House Floor linking North Minneapolis to the St. Cloud Prison. "Right on the edge of St. Cloud, maybe a half a mile, a quarter-mile, from the rail tracks is the St. Cloud State Prison.... Boy, wouldn't that be convenient, to have that rail line going from that prison to North Minneapolis..." This drew boos from other members of the House. Governor Mark Dayton later called for the House Leadership to punish Newberger. "I think [he] should be reprimanded, if not censured by his leadership" Dayton said. Shortly after the incident, Newberger made a public apology, saying that he did not mean to offend anyone, but to voice the concerns of the people in his district. Newberger agreed that he should have made his point differently, and said he would be careful about what he says in the future when trying to elucidate the concerns of District 15B. Shortly thereafter, Newberger was reprimanded once again for arguably violating general separation of powers principles [better source needed] in attempting to use his position as an elected official to influence the outcome of a judicial proceeding involving a donor, who was in a dispute that resulted in a judgment against the donor of about $250,000.  Newberger is married to Michele Newberger. They have three daughters and reside in Becker, Minnesota.
