Registered Health Information Technician (RHIT) is a professional certification administered by the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA) in the United States. Passing the exam results in licensure as a health information technician.  To be eligible, an individual must achieve an associate degree approved by the Commission on Accreditation for Health Informatics and Information Management Education (CAHIIM) or graduate from a foreign association that has a reciprocity agreement with AHIMA.    The health information technician is responsible for organizing comprehensively and accurately the medical record of each patient. They ensure that all the necessary forms are present, properly identified, signed and filed. Health information technicians are able to translate complex data into understandable, interesting and simplified information for the general public. They take the medical records produced by the health care provider and translate them into a code that identifies each diagnoses and procedure utilized in treating the patient.   RHIT's can further their career advancement by completing a CAHIIM-accredited Baccalaureate degree in health information management, and take a national credential exam in health information administration as a certified Registered Health Information Administrator (RHIA).
