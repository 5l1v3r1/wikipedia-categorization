She has been referred to as \"Nurse\" Waddingham, because the two murders she was accused and convicted of were committed in a nursing home she ran near <a href=\"/wiki/Nottingham\" title=\"Nottingham\">Nottingham</a> in England. However, she was not a qualified nurse and the only medical training she received was as a ward-maid at an infirmary near <a href=\"/wiki/Burton-on-Trent\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Burton-on-Trent\">Burton-on-Trent</a>. In 1925 she married Thomas Willoughby Leech. He was twice her age and dying of <a href=\"/wiki/Cancer\" title=\"Cancer\">cancer</a>. During their marriage she served two prison terms, for <a href=\"/wiki/Fraud\" title=\"Fraud\">fraud</a> and for theft.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>  Leech died in 1930, at which time Waddingham was seeing another man named Ronald Joseph Sullivan. Sullivan had fought in <a href=\"/wiki/World_War_I\" title=\"World War I\">World War I</a> and had been awarded the <a href=\"/wiki/Military_Medal\" title=\"Military Medal\">Military Medal</a> for gallantry and also served in <a href=\"/wiki/Ireland\" title=\"Ireland\">Ireland</a> after the war.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>  They would marry and have four children.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>  While married to Sullivan she began to take in elderly and infirm patients, and turned her home at 32 Devon Drive, Nottingham into a nursing home.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Activities\">Activities</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Dorothea_Waddingham&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Activities\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Mrs Blagg, the Honorary Secretary of the County Nursing Association, approved of Waddingham's work, and arranged for Mrs Baguley who was 89 and her daughter Ada, who had <a href=\"/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis\" title=\"Multiple sclerosis\">multiple sclerosis</a> or \"creeping paralysis\", to become patients. In February 1935 another patient named Mrs Kemp died from an illness which required large dosages of <a href=\"/wiki/Morphine\" title=\"Morphine\">morphine</a>. Plenty of the drug remained on the premises of Waddingham's nursing home.\n</p><p>Ada Baguley had made a will leaving her estate of \u00a31,600 in trust for her mother after her death, and with the rest to be divided between two <a href=\"/wiki/Cousin\" title=\"Cousin\">cousins</a>, Lawrence Baguley and Fred Gilbert, after her mother died. Ada had been informed that it was likely she would precede her mother in death. However, this will was destroyed by Ada in May 1935, and a new will created that left all the money to Dorothea Waddingham and Ronald Sullivan when Ada and her mother both died (it being in recompense for the nurse's care of them). The elderly Mrs Baguley died in the second week of May.\n</p><p>Ada lasted through the spring and summer of 1935. Later it was said<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Words_to_watch#Unsupported_attributions\" title=\"Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch\"><span title=\"The material near this tag may use weasel words or too-vague attribution. (August 2014)\">by whom?</span></a></i>&#93;</sup> that Waddingham was quite attentive to her. In September 1935 Ada received a visit from an old family friend, Mrs Alice Briggs, who spent an afternoon cheering her up. Mrs Briggs told Waddingham that she would have Ada over for tea at her home in a couple of days. But on 11 September (the next day) Sullivan advised Dr H. H. Mansfield that his patient Ada was in a <a href=\"/wiki/Coma\" title=\"Coma\">coma</a>. Mansfield came and found Ada was dead. As this was expected the doctor was not suspicious, and after getting further details from Waddingham he filled out a <a href=\"/wiki/Death_certificate\" title=\"Death certificate\">death certificate</a> that Ada died of <a href=\"/wiki/Cardiovascular\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cardiovascular\">cardiovascular</a> degeneration.\n</p><p>Ada had given her permission to be <a href=\"/wiki/Cremate\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cremate\">cremated</a> and if the cremation had gone through it is probable that Waddingham could not have been proved guilty of Ada's death. But for the body to be cremated needed two doctors to sign the certificate, and this could only be done after the family of the deceased was notified. Ada had noted in her will a request not to notify her relatives. Waddingham said there were no relatives, which was a lie.\n</p><p>Unfortunately for Waddingham, the man in charge of <a href=\"/wiki/Cremation\" title=\"Cremation\">cremations</a> was Dr Cyril Banks, who was also the <a href=\"/wiki/Medical_Officer_for_Health\" title=\"Medical Officer for Health\">Medical Officer for Health</a> in <a href=\"/wiki/Nottingham\" title=\"Nottingham\">Nottingham</a>. Banks had never thought highly of Waddingham's establishment as a so-called \"nursing home\", and knew there was no <a href=\"/wiki/State_Registered_Nurse\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"State Registered Nurse\">State Registered Nurse</a> on the staff (as there should have been). He became suspicious at the note from Ada Baguley that authorised cremation<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> and ordered a <a href=\"/wiki/Post-mortem\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Post-mortem\">post-mortem</a>. The post-mortem found no traces of anything connected to Ada's physical conditions that could have immediately caused death. This led to an analysis of the organs of the deceased by Dr W. W. Taylor, Senior Assistant to the Nottingham Analyst. He found considerable traces of morphine (over three <a href=\"/wiki/Grain_(measure)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Grain (measure)\">grains</a>) in her <a href=\"/wiki/Stomach\" title=\"Stomach\">stomach</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Liver\" title=\"Liver\">liver</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Kidney\" title=\"Kidney\">kidneys</a> and her heart.\n</p><p>Suspicions were now raised about the death of Mrs Baguley, and an <a href=\"/wiki/Exhumation\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Exhumation\">exhumation</a> ordered by the <a href=\"/wiki/Home_Office\" title=\"Home Office\">Home Office</a> occurred. This was handled by Dr Roche Lynch, who found the mother had also died of <a href=\"/wiki/Morphine\" title=\"Morphine\">morphine</a> poisoning. This led to the arrests of Waddingham and Sullivan for the two murders.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Trial\">Trial</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Dorothea_Waddingham&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Trial\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Waddingham's trial started on 4 February 1936 before <a href=\"/wiki/Rayner_Goddard,_Baron_Goddard\" title=\"Rayner Goddard, Baron Goddard\">Mr Justice Goddard</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> Her barrister was Mr Eales,<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> with the prosecution by <a href=\"/wiki/Norman_Birkett\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Norman Birkett\">Norman Birkett</a> (a rarity, for Birkett normally handled criminal defence). Birkett brought out much damaging testimony, including how Ada Baguley's last meal was heavy and rich for a woman in her condition: Waddingham admitted that she gave Ada pork, baked potatoes, kidney beans and two portions of fruit pie. It was suggested as an effort to disguise the cause of death and showed a lack of concern for the patient's welfare.<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> The result was that Waddingham was convicted of using morphine to poison Mrs Baguley and Ada. The purported motive behind the murders was to gain the Baguleys' estate.
