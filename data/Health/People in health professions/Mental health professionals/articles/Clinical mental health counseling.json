Clinical mental health counselors operate from a wellness perspective, which emphasizes moving toward optimal human functioning in mind, body, and spirit, and away from distress, dysfunction, and mental illness.  Counselors also view wellness and pathology as developmental in nature, and take into consideration all levels of a client's environment when conducting assessment and treatment. Counselors also frequently take a team approach, collaborating with other mental health professionals to provide the most comprehensive care possible for the client.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\"

of mental health and illness\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Early Greek philosophy provides some of the earliest views of mental health and illness.  Hippocrates, who is considered the father of medicine, related behavioral tendencies and a person\u2019s temperament to the relative balance of their body fluids.  He believed that imbalances of these fluids led to aberrant behaviors.  Other Greek philosophers such as Plato theorized that aberrant behaviors stemmed from societal issues that required a community response.  Promoting happiness and wellness was also a major theme for the early Greeks and Romans.  The founder of hedonism, Epicurus, advocated for the hedonistic lifestyle, but he also warned that there was a risk of pain if the pleasures were withdrawn. Epictetus, on the other hand, believed that people were not disturbed by things, but by the view they took of those things, so he advocated for peace of mind to treat these disturbances.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Gerig,_M._S._2014_2-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Gerig,_M._S._2014-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>There were both cruel and humane treatments developed in the Middle Ages for the mentally ill.  Most behaviors that could not be explained were attributed to supernatural causes and that humans innately had a battle between good and evil happening inside of them all the time.  People were tested to see if they were evil or with the devil using \u201cwater tests\u201d.  In Baghdad and Damascus, however, in the ninth and tenth centuries, humane treatments were being developed in which centers of care for the mentally ill were based in love and kindness.  Humanity regressed again in the 16th century when hospitals known as asylums were developed to provide a place for people who were unable to care for themselves.  These institutions were terrible and people were often kept in restraints and left there in their own waste.  In the late 1700s, there were people who began to reform the system and developed something known as moral treatment at the time.  Moral treatment included organized schedules of productive behavior, socializing, entertainment, education, exercise, and nutrition.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Gerig,_M._S._2014_2-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Gerig,_M._S._2014-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_origins_of_counseling\">The origins of counseling</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Clinical_mental_health_counseling&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: The origins of counseling\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In the early 1900s, counseling had not yet developed into treatment of mental health issues and was more focused in education.  Frank Parsons, known as the father of guidance, developed a plan to educate counselors and began the Vocational Guidance Movement. He was concerned with the problems of youth as youth unemployment became a major concern for adolescents as urbanization occurred and sustainable work and family income generated on family farms was not as prevalent.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Gerig,_M._S._2014_2-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Gerig,_M._S._2014-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>  At this time, counselors were considered vocational counselors and this initiated the approach that began to form the more contemporary counseling process.  Around the same time, Clifford Beers, a former patient of mental health hospitals, wrote a book exposing the terrible conditions of mental health institutions and he advocated for reform.  Beers later founded the National Committee for Mental Hygiene, which later became the National Mental Health Association.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Gerig,_M._S._2014_2-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Gerig,_M._S._2014-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>   Jessie B. Davis was the first individual to make guidance a regular part of the school curriculum.  He was a superintendent or administrator and advocated for what became school guidance and counseling.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Locke,_D._C._2001_3-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Locke,_D._C._2001-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>During the great depression, counseling methods and strategies for employment grew as it was greatly needed at the time.  In 1932, Brewer wrote a book entitled \u201cEducation as Guidance\u201d, which promoted the broadening of counseling beyond just occupation.  He suggested that every teacher share the implementation of counseling and that guidance needed to be in every school curriculum.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Locke,_D._C._2001_3-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Locke,_D._C._2001-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>  In the 1940s, Carl Rogers began the development of counseling and psychotherapy.  He believed that the client knows best and that only they could explain what their needs are and what direction to go in counseling based on what problems were crucial and needed attention.  Rogers clearly indicated that he was not doing psychology and the courses he taught were based in the department of education.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Gerig,_M._S._2014_2-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Gerig,_M._S._2014-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>World War II brought to the forefront the importance of testing and placement as there was a strong need for selection and training of specialists for the military and industry.  Counselors and Psychologists had the necessary skills to fill this much needed role.  At the same time, thousands of soldiers were in need as a result of their combat experiences.  The veterans administration provided professional counseling services to soldiers after their discharge and in 1945, the VA granted stipends and internships for students in counseling and psychology, boosting the support and training available to counselors.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Gerig,_M._S._2014_2-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Gerig,_M._S._2014-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>  This time marked the beginning of government spending on counselor preparation as we know it today.  Clinical psychologists were trained to treat and diagnose individuals with chronic disorders, and counseling psychologists were trained to deal with issues presented by people with high levels of mental health.  This led to a new division or category of psychologists and the Division of Counseling and Guidance of the American Psychological Association changed the title to the Division of Counseling Psychology.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Gerig,_M._S._2014_2-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Gerig,_M._S._2014-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_professionalization_of_mental_health_counseling\">The professionalization of mental health counseling</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Clinical_mental_health_counseling&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: The professionalization of mental health counseling\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In the 1950s, flaws in the existing mental health system were being exposed and clinically effective pharmacological treatments were also being developed that could be provided in outpatient settings. This led to a need for community based clinics, but access to these services were very limited.  The Community Mental Health Act of 1963 was very important in the development of the counseling profession.  After the government analyzed the problems with mental illness and effective treatments, President John F. Kennedy believed that high quality treatment centers located in the patients community could lead to the phasing out of state mental hospitals and drastically improve the mental health system in the United States.  The national network of community mental health centers created a demand for counselors and the profession began to expand and increase numbers of counselors.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Gerig,_M._S._2014_2-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Gerig,_M._S._2014-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>As the counseling helping profession grew, there became a need to regulate the quality of services being provided by professionals via state licensure.  In 1974, a special committee was appointed by the <a href=\"/wiki/American_Personnel_and_Guidance_Association\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"American Personnel and Guidance Association\">American Personnel and Guidance Association</a> that focused on counselor licensure.  This began the steps towards the first counselor licensure law in Virginia in 1976.  In the 1980s mental health counseling had clearly established itself as a profession with a distinct set of regulations and methods to providing services.  According to Gerig &amp; Gerig (2014), distinct professional are characterized by \u201crole statements, codes of ethics, accreditation guidelines, competency standards, licensure, certification, and other standards of excellence\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Gerig,_M._S._2014_2-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Gerig,_M._S._2014-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>  The counseling profession as we know it today has established all of these facets of a distinct profession and is being recognized more and more as a valuable and much needed helping profession in our society.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Education.2C_licensure.2C_and_certification\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Education,_licensure,_and_certification\">Education, licensure, and certification</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Clinical_mental_health_counseling&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Education, licensure, and certification\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Licensure\">Licensure</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Clinical_mental_health_counseling&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Licensure\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Counselor licensure is established by state law and is the most powerful type of credential.  Receiving a license in counseling indicates that one has met the minimum standards to practice counseling in that state.  State laws vary in the requirements that must be met to obtain a license.  Candidates must have at least received a master's degree, have had post-master\u2019s supervised practice, and have passed a national exam.  From state to state, the number of credit hours to be completed varies, as do the number of supervised hours that must be completed and the counselor titles used.  Some counselors may find that if they are licensed in one state, and then move to another state, they may have to take additional courses in order to receive licensure in that state.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Remley_2010_pp._29-36_4-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Remley_2010_pp._29-36-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>  Below, the standards for licensure in North Carolina are described.

Continuing education is a critical requirement for members of a profession as it ensures that all professionals\u2019 skills and expertise are continuously updated to reflect the most current research and recommendations; professional organizations provide this continuing education to its members.

Regarding governmental insurance, this type of coverage is dependent on whether or not the specific agency is approved for federal and/or state funding. When it comes to serving Medicare-covered clients, counselors in the U.S. are still exempt from the list of acceptable providers, thus it is a current issue of great concern in our community. For private policies, such as Blue Cross/Blue Shield, the agency must secure a placement on the insurance company's provider panel, again no small task. It is also common for community agencies to respect uninsured clients, or clients facing financial hardship, by operating on a sliding scale, or payment plan.<sup id=\"cite_ref-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Private_practice\">Private practice</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Clinical_mental_health_counseling&amp;action=edit&amp;section=21\" title=\"Edit section: Private practice\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Although private practices are common in the American mental health counseling community, a licensed counselor often enters this kind of setting after several formative, professional years have passed, following completion of a master's degree program. Before making the transition into the private setting, many therapists work for a larger community-based agency, hospital, or treatment facility. The advantages certainly include, but are not limited to: an independence in providing therapy; the ability to be more selective when it comes to the clientele and population(s) served; and incorporating unique skills and special training, such as play therapy, EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing), etc.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Gerig,_M.S._2014_pp._177-178_14-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Gerig,_M.S._2014_pp._177-178-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup>\nHowever, the act of operating a private practice is akin to running a small business. In order to prosper, it is crucial for the counselor to have proper business and public representation skills. In deciding to hang a shingle, one must be prepared to establish and maintain a respectable presence in his or her community, oftentimes promoting awareness (and thus one's business) on one's own time. Awareness activities include visiting places of worship, community centers, local businesses, etc. to perform psychoeducation workshops.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Gerig,_M.S._2014_pp._177-178_14-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Gerig,_M.S._2014_pp._177-178-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup>\nAs described in the previous section of Community Mental Health Agencies, the same standards of insurance coverage, as well as sliding scale payment, apply to private practice settings.

Both outpatient and residential services last an average of thirty to ninety days. Due to this seemingly brief span of time for treatment, counselors strongly encourage their clients struggling with addiction(s) to become regular attendees of local AA and/or NA meetings, and to obtain a sponsor as soon as possible.<sup id=\"cite_ref-17\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-17\">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"University_or_college_counseling_center\">University or college counseling center</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Clinical_mental_health_counseling&amp;action=edit&amp;section=23\" title=\"Edit section: University or college counseling center\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>This counseling setting is typically based within a school's wellness or health center, directly on campus.

There are multiple ethical codes within the field of counseling that counselors are expected to abide by within their work and professional role.  These codes are then enforced by ethics committees and licensure boards.  A violation of code may lead to a number of consequences, dependent upon the severity of the violation, and varying in such: one might be placed on probation, suspended, or even have their license revoked.<sup id=\"cite_ref-RH_37-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-RH-37\">&#91;37&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>While law clarifies a profession\u2019s scope of practice, ethics are important to each profession for a number of reasons.  Not only do codes of ethics provide standards to which members of the profession are held accountable, but they also aid in the improvement of provided services.  Ethical codes promote professionalism, and provide evidence of the intent of members within a profession to regulate and moderate their behavior.  They assist in identifying appropriate courses of action for situations that arise without clear and easy resolution.  Also, while ethical codes cannot be entirely preventative, they protect consumers from dangerous and/or inappropriate practice.  Different professional organizations within each field may have their own personal code of ethics as well, such as the American Counseling Association and the American Mental Health Counselors Association in the profession of counseling.<sup id=\"cite_ref-G_38-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-G-38\">&#91;38&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>It has been concluded that ethics encompasses five different features: possessing adequate knowledge, skills, and judgment to produce effective interventions; respecting the dignity, freedom, and rights of the client; using power inherent in the counselor\u2019s role judiciously and responsibly; conducting oneself in such a way that promotes the public\u2019s confidence in the profession; maintaining the client\u2019s welfare as the highest priority of the mental health professional,\u00ee.<sup id=\"cite_ref-G_38-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-G-38\">&#91;38&#93;</a></sup>  Similarly, six different principle ethics are often considered as crucial to take into account when faced with an ethical decision: the principle of autonomy, which relates to the client\u2019s right to control their own life, decisions, future, etc.; nonmaleficence, which translates to doing no harm to the client; somewhat oppositely, beneficence, which means doing good for or promoting the welfare of your client; justice, referring to fairness and equality on the part of the professional; fidelity, which requires the professional to fulfill a responsibility of faithfulness and trust; and veracity, which means being truthful and honest with clients.<sup id=\"cite_ref-RH_37-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-RH-37\">&#91;37&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The newest 2014 edition of the American Counseling Association\u2019s Code of Ethics contains nine sections that each address a separate area of ethical conduct: the counseling relationship; confidentiality and privacy; professional responsibility; relationships with other professionals; evaluation, assessment, and interpretation; supervision, training, and teaching; research and publication; distance counseling, technology, and social media; and resolving ethical issues.<sup id=\"cite_ref-39\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-39\">&#91;39&#93;</a></sup>  A brief description of some of these predominant realms follows.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Confidentiality\">Confidentiality</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Clinical_mental_health_counseling&amp;action=edit&amp;section=30\" title=\"Edit section: Confidentiality\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Confidentiality refers to the respect of a client\u2019s privacy.  Any information that a client reveals during counseling is protected.  The client\u2019s consent is required for the reveal of information to a third party.  Laws of privileged communication within applicable states also further protect the privacy of clients.  Where privileged communication is present, confidential information does not need to be disclosed in court without the client\u2019s permission.  Confidentiality is crucial to create the safety, trust, and honesty required in an effective, beneficial counseling relationship.  Outside of privileged communication, there are generally four instances in which confidential information may be released to a third party: if the client allows the counselor to do so with a signed release of information, if the client discloses or is suspected to be an imminent threat of safety or danger to self or others, if current abuse or the intent of abuse of another is disclosed, or if a court order or subpoena requires the release of client records or testimony of the counselor.<sup id=\"cite_ref-RH_37-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-RH-37\">&#91;37&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Competence\">Competence</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Clinical_mental_health_counseling&amp;action=edit&amp;section=31\" title=\"Edit section: Competence\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>This concept of competence requires proof of minimum competency for a professional, while also striving to practice in an ideal manner.  For each credential that a counselor earns, such as a degree and licensure, there are minimum prerequisites of performance that must be met.  A counselor may also be competent or incompetent in different types of counseling, working with different populations, or specializing in different theoretical orientations.  Competency also needs to be maintained over time and should be self-monitored.  Counselors should continue to access and review current research, and continuing education credits can be earned through workshops, seminars, webinars, etc.  When this ethical concept is not maintained, a counselor may be risking professional misconduct, and may even face trial for malpractice.<sup id=\"cite_ref-RH_37-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-RH-37\">&#91;37&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Informed_consent\">Informed consent</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Clinical_mental_health_counseling&amp;action=edit&amp;section=32\" title=\"Edit section: Informed consent\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Informed_consent\" title=\"Informed consent\">Informed consent</a></div>\n<p>Informed consent is typically addressed through a form at the beginning of a counseling relationship, and pertains to the client\u2019s right to be aware of the nature of that relationship and the counseling process itself.
