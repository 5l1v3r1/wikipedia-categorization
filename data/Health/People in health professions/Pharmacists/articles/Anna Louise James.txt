Anna Louise James (1886-1977) was the first African-American female pharmacist in Connecticut.    In 1908 she became the first African-American female graduate of the Brooklyn College of Pharmacy and the first African-American woman licensed as a pharmacist in Connecticut.   In 1911 she went to work for her brother-in-law's pharmacy.  Her niece, Ann Petry, had been born at the pharmacy in 1908 and lived in it as her childhood home.   In 1917, Anna Louise took over the pharmacy (as her brother-in-law was fighting in World War I) and renamed it James Pharmacy.  She operated it until 1967.  She died in 1977 and is buried with her brother in Cypress Cemetery.  In 1994 James Pharmacy was added to the National Register of Historic Places.
