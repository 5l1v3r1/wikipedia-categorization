One of the nationâ€™s leading health economists, Pauly has made significant contributions to the fields of medical economics and health insurance. He is considered to be one of the key architects of the individual mandate, which he and a team of economists proposed to George H. W. Bush in the late 1980s.  His classic study on the economics of moral hazard was the first to point out how health insurance coverage may affect patients' use of medical services. Subsequent work, both theoretical and empirical, has explored the impact of conventional insurance coverage on preventive care, outpatient care, and prescription drug use in managed care. In addition, he has explored the influences that determine whether insurance coverage is available and, by several cost-effectiveness studies, the influence of medical care and health practices on health outcomes and cost. His interests in health policy deal with ways to reduce the number of uninsured through tax credits for public and private insurance and the appropriate design for Medicare in a budget-constrained environment. He is currently studying the effect of poor health on worker productivity.
