The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) is the agency of the government of Oklahoma responsible for investigating sudden, unexpected, violent or suspicious deaths. In this capacity, OCME provides support services to State law enforcement agencies, prosecutors, and public health officials.  The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner was created by the Oklahoma Legislature in 1961 but did not receive funding to become operational until 1967. The Chief Medical Examiner must be a licensed physician, trained and certified in forensic pathology. The Board of Medicolegal Investigations is responsible for governing the operations of OCME and for setting policy which the Chief Medical Examiner executes. It is the responsibility of the Board to appoint and dismiss the Chief Medical Examiner. All members of the Board receive no compensation for their services. The Board appoints a Chief Medical Examiner, who is the chief executive of the OCME. Under Oklahoma statute, deaths of the types listed below must be reported to the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. The Office has the authority to further investigate for the benefit of the public health, as funding, staffing, facilities, and other regulations allow.  The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner was authorized a budget of $6.2 million for State fiscal year 2012. The Oklahoma Legislature authorized the agency to employ 77 full time equivalent positions for that period.
