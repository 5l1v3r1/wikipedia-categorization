The Kitava Study (A study of the diet and health of the people living on Kitava Island, Papua New Guinea; study of  a people with a traditional, non-westernized diet) Staffan Lindeberg (1950 - 2016) was an Associate Professor of Family Medicine at the Department of Medicine,  University of Lund,  Sweden. He was a practicing GP at St Lars Primary Health Care Center, Lund, Sweden, a medical researcher, and a passionate proponent of evolutionary nutrition. Lindeberg was a leading researcher of an evolution-based, paleolithic diet.   Lindeberg's research was well accepted within the Paleolithic nutrition and popularized paleo diet communities. He was one of the few, though, who thought less meat and animal food products, and thus more plant food intake, was entirely consistent with evolutionary nutrition - as long as you exclude high-glycemic plant foods, grains and beans.
