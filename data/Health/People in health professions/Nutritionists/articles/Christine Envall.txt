Between 1991 and 1995, Christine Envall participated in six NABBA Australasian Championships. Inn 1995, during the NPCA/IFBB Australian Nationals, she was awarded her IFBB pro status without being judged. Also in 1995, during the NPC-A/IFBB Australasian Championships Envall was ranked 3rd, simply because her very lean profile did not set a good example for the other women. Reason being that her physique didn't warrant her to compete in the same category as amateur bodybuilders. Between 1996 and 2001, Christine focused most of her energy in trying out for various NABBA World Championships.  In 2001, Envall competed in her first IFBB pro show, the Jan Tana Classic, where she placed 6th in the heavyweight class. In 2015, at the Toronto Pro Supershow she won her first ever IFBB pro competition. It is documented that Christine Envall is the only active IFBB female bodybuilder from Australia.  Envall currently lives Gold Coast, Queensland.  She has been very active in the supplements and nutrition. She is one of the owners of one of the largest nutrition powerhouses, International Protein, in Australia. She jointly owns it with her husband Troy Bremner.
