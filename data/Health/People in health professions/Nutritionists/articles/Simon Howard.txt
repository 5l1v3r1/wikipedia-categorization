Howard qualified as a medical doctor with the degree MBBS from Newcastle University in 2008. He was awarded an MSc in Public Health and Health Services Research from Newcastle University in 2011.

From 2013-2014, Howard served as Public Health Registrar to Chief Medical Officer Sally Davies, and acted as Editor-in-Chief of the 2012 Annual Report of the Chief Medical Officer.   He has contributed to or co-authored a number of other works with Davies.   In 2012, Howard co-wrote a study in the British Medical Journal that compared the nutritional content of television chefs' recipes and supermarket meals. The study found that the chefs' meals were "less healthy" than ready-made supermarket meals.  The article received considerable coverage in the news media,     while some scholars criticised the assumption that "health ought to prominently inform TV cooking."   In 2010, Howard re-published a compilation of his political blog posts in a book titled Instant Opinion.
