Herodicus (Greek: Ἡρóδιĸος) was a Greek       physician of the 5th century BC,  a native of Selymbria.  The first use of therapeutic exercise for the treatment of disease and maintenance of health is credited to him, and he is believed to have been one of the tutors of Hippocrates.  He also recommended good diet and massage using beneficial herbs and oils, and his theories are considered the foundation of sports medicine.  He was specific in the manner that a massage should be given.  He recommended that rubbing be initially slow and gentle, then subsequently faster, with the application of more pressure, which was to be followed by more gentle friction.    Herodicus is also described as a gymnastic-master (παιδοτρίβης) and a sophist.  According to Plato, Herodicus recommended that his patients walk from Athens to Megara, a distance of a little more than 20 miles.
