Examples of biopsy procedures are bone marrow biopsy, brain biopsy, skin biopsy and liver biopsy. Different types of matter that are sampled can be categorized by solidness versus fluidity, such as: Body fluid sampling include: The sampled matter can be analyzed for various components, for example: Microbiological sampling include:
