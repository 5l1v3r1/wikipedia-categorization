The STROBE (STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology) Statement is a reporting guideline including a checklist of 22 items that are considered essential for good reporting of observational studies. It has been published in several leading biomedical journals in October and November 2007 and is referred to in the Vancouver guidelines (Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals) established by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors. The STROBE Statement was developed by the STROBE Initiative, an international collaboration of epidemiologists, methodologists, statisticians, researchers and journal editors with the aim to assist authors when writing up analytical observational studies, to support editors and reviewers when considering such articles for publication, and to help readers when critically appraising published articles.   Extensions to STROBE include RECORD, for "The REporting of studies Conducted using Observational Routinely-collected Data".  RECORD is intended for observational studies using routinely collected health data, such as health administrative data, electronic health records, and registry data.  A draft checklist for reporting observational studies in conference abstracts is also available.  A STROBE extension for nutritional epidemiology "STROBE-nut"[permanent dead link] was developed and contains 24 items for manuscripts that report findings from dietary assessment and nutritional epidemiology.
