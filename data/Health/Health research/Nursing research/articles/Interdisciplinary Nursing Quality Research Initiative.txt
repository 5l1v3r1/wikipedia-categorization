The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation’s (RWJF) Interdisciplinary Nursing Quality Research Initiative (INQRI) is a $19 million program to generate and disseminate research showing a link between what nurses do and the contributions they make to advancing better and safer care for patients. INQRI supports interdisciplinary teams of nurse scholars and scholars from other disciplines to develop, test and validate new quality measures that capture nurses’ contributions to patient outcomes–including care coordination, pain management and medication management. The program is led by Mary Naylor, a nurse and health services researcher, and Mark Pauly, a health care economist, both at the University of Pennsylvania, in partnership with Lori Melichar and colleagues at the RWJF.  Since 2006, INQRI grantees have conducted research into a range of important health care areas, with research teams from institutions around the country examining ways to stem preventable medical errors, improve how we measure quality and provide better care to people with chronic illnesses, among other areas. For example, a study at Johns Hopkins Hospital has identified a series of best practices that nursing are leading to minimize deadly blood-stream infections. INQRI teams will share their research with policymakers, hospital administrators and others who determine how nursing resources will be distributed to improve the quality and outcomes of patient care.
