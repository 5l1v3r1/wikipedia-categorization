Good clinical data management practice (GCDMP) is the current industry standards for clinical data management that consist of best business practice and acceptable regulatory standards. In all phases of clinical trials, clinical and laboratory information must be collected and converted to digital form for analysis and reporting purposes.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use have provided specific regulations and guidelines surrounding this component of the drug and device development process.  The effective, efficient and regulatory-compliant management of clinical trial data is an essential component of drug and device development.  The Society for Clinical Data Management (SCDM) has created a comprehensive document that provides guidance on accepted practices of clinical data management (CDM) that are not totally covered by current guidelines and regulations.  This document is entitled Good Clinical Data Management Practices (GCDMP) and updated by Subject Matter Experts on a continuous basis.
