Trial registration is the practice of publishing the methodology of clinical trials before they begin. This reduces problems from publication bias and selective reporting (such as choosing the methodology after the results are known).  Clinical trial registrations are now common and required by many funders and governments,   and are increasingly being standardized.  Trial registration is less common in other disciplines, but is part of the open science movement.
