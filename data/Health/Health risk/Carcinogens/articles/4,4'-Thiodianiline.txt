4,4'-Thiodianiline (TDA) is an aromatic amine which is presumed to be carcinogenic to humans. TDA is not combustible, but when heated it may decompose to form irritating and toxic fumes.  An analogue of TDA is dapsone. Sulfur is boiled in excess aniline over several hours to produce three isomers (1,1'; 1,4; 4,4') of TDA.  The same journal documents syntheses of similar and overlapping compounds by Merz and Weith in 1871, and K. A. Hoffman in 1894. A study by Nietzki and Bothof  shows indications that including an oxide of lead may maximize the yield of the 4,4' variant that this page refers to. TDA was used as a chemical intermediate in the production of three dyes: CI mordant yellow 16, milling red G and milling red FR, as well as the medicine Dapsone. TDA is no longer produced in the USA. TDA has caused mutations in some strains of Salmonella typhimurium and has caused tumors in laboratory mice and rats.
