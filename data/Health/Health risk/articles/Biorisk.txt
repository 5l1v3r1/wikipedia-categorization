Biorisk generally refers to the risk associated with biological materials and/or infectious agents. The term has been used frequently for various purposes since the early 1990s.   The term is used by regulators, laboratory personnel and industry alike and is used by WHO.  WHO/Europe also provides tools and training courses in biosafety and biosecurity.  An international Laboratory Biorisk Management Standard developed under the auspices of the European Committee for Standardization, defines biorisk as the combination of the probability of occurrence of harm and the severity of that harm where the source of harm is a biological agent or toxin.  The source of harm may be an unintentional exposure, accidental release or loss, theft, misuse, diversion, unauthorized access or intentional unauthorized release. In Norway, "Biorisk" is trademarked by the Norwegian accredited registrar DNV.
