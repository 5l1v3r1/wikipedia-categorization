The Freedom Fund is an international non-profit organisation dedicated to identifying and investing in the most effective frontline efforts to end slavery.

The Freedom Fund has set a target of raising USD $100million by 2020 and investing it to bring about much needed strategic focus to the fight against modern slavery.  To achieve this, The Freedom Fund has focused its activities on three main areas:  The Freedom Fund's inaugural CEO, Nick Grono, has written articles on modern slavery for the Huffington Post,  Newsweek,  and The Guardian   as well as contributed to the Freedom Fund blog.
