The Rosenberg self-esteem scale (RSES), developed by sociologist Dr. Morris Rosenberg,  is a self-esteem measure widely used in social-science research. It uses a scale of 0-30 where a score less than 15 may indicate a problematic low self esteem.  The RSES is designed similar to the social-survey questionnaires. It is a ten-item Likert-type scale with items answered on a four-point scaleâ€”from strongly agree to strongly disagree. Five of the items have positively worded statements and five have negatively worded ones. The scale measures state self-esteem by asking the respondents to reflect on their current feelings. The original sample for which the scale was developed consisted of 5,024 high-school juniors and seniors from 10 randomly selected schools in New York State. The Rosenberg self-esteem scale is considered a reliable and valid quantitative tool for self-esteem assessment.  The RSES has been translated and adapted to various languages, such as Persian,  French,  Chinese,  Italian,  German,  Portuguese,  and Spanish.  The scale is extensively used in cross-cultural studies in up to 53 different nations.
