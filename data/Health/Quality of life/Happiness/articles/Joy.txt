The word joy means a feeling of great pleasure and happiness.   C. S. Lewis saw clear distinction between joy, pleasure, and happiness: "I sometimes wonder whether all pleasures are not substitutes for Joy." , and "I call it Joy, which is here a technical term and must be sharply distinguished both from Happiness and Pleasure. Joy (in my sense) has indeed one characteristic, and one only, in common with them; the fact that anyone who has experienced it will want it again... I doubt whether anyone who has tasted it would ever, if both were in his power, exchange it for all the pleasures in the world. But then Joy is never in our power and Pleasure often is."  The causes of joy have been ascribed to various sources. “When the mind is pure, joy follows like a shadow that never leaves.” Gautama Buddha,  "[Joy is] the emotional dimension of the good life, of a life that is both going well and is being lived well."Miroslav Volf,  "This is the true joy in life, the being used for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one; the being thoroughly worn out before you are thrown on the scrap heap; the being a force of Nature instead of a feverish selfish little clod of ailments and grievances complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy." George Bernard Shaw  and “Find a place inside where there's joy, and the joy will burn out the pain.” Joseph Campbell.
