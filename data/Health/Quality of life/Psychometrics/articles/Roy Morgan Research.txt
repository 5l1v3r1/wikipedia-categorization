Roy Morgan Research is an Australian market research company headquartered in Melbourne. It was founded in 1941 by Roy Morgan (1908â€“1985); its Executive Chairman today is his son, Gary Morgan; CEO is Michele Levine. The company has annual turnover of more than A$40 million, and along with the head office in Melbourne, also has offices in Sydney, Perth and Brisbane as well as offices of Roy Morgan International in Auckland, London, New York City, Princeton and Jakarta. The results are published on www.roymorgan.com and by newspapers, magazines, television, radio, the Internet and online subscription services such as Crikey and Henry Thornton. The company is a major provider of advertising and media planning data and undertakes large government, social and corporate research programs. Roy Morgan Research developed the Worm,  which first appeared on live TV on Channel TEN's 'Face To Face' current affairs program.  This leading Audience Response Measurement technology was colloquially described as The Worm because of the live graphs that snake their way over the television screen, displaying the audience's reactions to visual stimuli (like an Election Debate) in real-time. After being commissioned to provide The Worm to the Nine Network for a decade, Roy Morgan Research discovered that Nine had secretly registered 'The Worm' as a trademark.  Primarily as a result of an ensuing dispute, Roy Morgan Research changed the branding from The Worm to The Reactor  in 2004 and continued to develop the product which is now primarily conducted online and via The Reactor mobile app. Roy Morgan Research conducts the fieldwork for The Melbourne Institute's Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey (HILDA).
