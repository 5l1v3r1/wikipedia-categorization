Goldberg psychiatric tests include various tests used to assess mental health in general or as screening tools for specific mental disorders e.g. depression or bipolar disorder. These tests were developed by two psychiatrists who share the last name "Goldberg": Ivan Goldberg, an American psychiatrist, and Sir David Goldberg, a British psychiatrist. Psychiatric screening tests generally don't substitute getting help from professionals.
