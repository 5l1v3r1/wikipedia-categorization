The Dot cancellation test  or Bourdon-Wiersma test is a commonly used test of combined visual perception and vigilance.   The test has been used in the evaluation of stroke where subjects were instructed to cross out all groups of 4 dots on an A4 paper. The numbers of uncrossed groups of 4 dots, groups of dots other than 4 crossed, and the time spent (maximum, 15 minutes) were taken into account.  The Group-Bourdon test, a modification of the Bourdon-Wiersma, is one of a number of psychometric tests which trainee train drivers in the UK are required to pass.   The test is based on the work of French psychologist Benjamin B. Bourdon (1860–1943) and Dutch neurologist Enno Dirk Wiersma (nl) (1858–1940).   Grewel, F (October 1953). "The Bourdon-Wiersma test".
