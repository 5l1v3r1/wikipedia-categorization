Frederic Mather Lord (November 12, 1912 in Hanover, NH â€“ February 5, 2000) was a psychometrician for Educational Testing Service. He was the source of much of the seminal research on item response theory,  including two important books: Statistical Theories of Mental Test Scores (1968, with Melvin Novick, and two chapters by Allan Birnbaum), and Applications of Item Response Theory to Practical Testing Problems (1980). Lord has been called the "Father of Modern Testing."
