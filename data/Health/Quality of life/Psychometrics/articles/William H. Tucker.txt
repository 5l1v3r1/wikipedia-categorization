William H. Tucker is an American psychologist. He is professor of psychology at Rutgers University and the author of several books critical of race science. Tucker received his bachelor's degree from Bates College in 1967, and his master's and doctorate from Princeton University. He joined the faculty at Rutgers University in 1970 and has been there since.  Tucker was a Psychometric Fellow for three years at Princeton, a position subsidized by Educational Testing Service. The majority of Tucker's scholarship has been about psychometrics, not in it. He currently sits on the advisory board of the Institute for the Study of Academic Racism.  He has written critical commentaries on several hereditarian psychologists known for their controversial work on race and intelligence. He has received awards for his research on Cyril Burt and the Pioneer Fund.  According to his website, "My research interests concern the use—or more properly the misuse—of social science to support oppressive social policies, especially in the area of race.  I seek to explore how scientists in general, and psychologists in particular, have become involved with such issues and what effect their participation has produced."
