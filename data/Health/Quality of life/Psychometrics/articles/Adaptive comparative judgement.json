So in 1792 the new Proctor of Examinations, William Farish, introduced marking, a process in which every examiner gives a numerical score to each response by every student, and the overall total mark puts the students in the final rank order. <a href=\"/wiki/Francis_Galton\" title=\"Francis Galton\">Francis Galton</a> (1869) noted that, in an unidentified year about 1863, the <a href=\"/wiki/Senior_Wrangler\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Senior Wrangler\">Senior Wrangler</a> scored 7,634 out of a maximum of 17,000, while the Second Wrangler scored 4,123. (The 'Wooden Spoon' scored only 237.)\n</p><p>Prior to 1792, a team of Cambridge examiners convened at 5pm on the last day of examining, reviewed the 19 papers each student had sat \u2013 and published their rank order at midnight. Marking solved the problems of numbers and prevented unfair personal bias, and its introduction was a step towards modern objective testing, the format it is best suited to. But the technology of testing that followed, with its major emphasis on reliability and the automatisation of marking, has been an uncomfortable partner for some areas of educational achievement: assessing writing or speaking, and other kinds of performance need something more <a href=\"/wiki/Qualitative_data\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Qualitative data\">qualitative</a> and judgemental.\n</p><p>The technique of Adaptive Comparative Judgement is an alternative to marking. It returns to the pre-1792 idea of sorting papers according to their quality, but retains the guarantee of reliability and fairness. It is by far the most reliable way known to score essays or more complex performances<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"Reliable source(s) needed to justify such a strong claim (September 2018)\">citation needed</span></a></i>&#93;</sup>. It is much simpler than marking, and has been preferred by almost all examiners who have tried it. The real appeal of Adaptive Comparative Judgement lies in how it can re-professionalise the activity of assessment and how it can re-integrate <a href=\"/wiki/Educational_assessment\" title=\"Educational assessment\">assessment</a> with learning.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"History\">History</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Adaptive_comparative_judgement&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: History\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Thurstone.27s_law_of_comparative_judgement\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Thurstone's_law_of_comparative_judgement\">Thurstone's law of comparative judgement</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Adaptive_comparative_judgement&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Thurstone&#039;s law of comparative judgement\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<style data-mw-deduplicate=\"TemplateStyles:r856303468\">.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}</style><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p>\"There is no such thing as absolute judgement\"</p><div class=\"templatequotecite\">\u2014&#8201;<cite>Laming (2004)<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup></cite></div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The science of comparative judgement began with <a href=\"/wiki/Louis_Leon_Thurstone\" title=\"Louis Leon Thurstone\">Louis Leon Thurstone</a> of the <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_Chicago\" title=\"University of Chicago\">University of Chicago</a>.

One of these was the <a href=\"/wiki/Law_of_comparative_judgment\" title=\"Law of comparative judgment\">law of comparative judgment</a> (Thurstone, 1927a, 1927b),<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> which defined a mathematical way of modeling the chance that one object will 'beat' another in a comparison, given values for the 'quality' of each. This is all that is needed to construct a complete measurement system.\n</p><p>A variation on his model (see <a href=\"/wiki/Pairwise_comparison\" title=\"Pairwise comparison\">Pairwise comparison</a> and the BTL model), states that the difference between their quality values is equal to the log of the odds that object-A will beat object-B:\n</p>\n<dl><dd><span class=\"mwe-math-element\"><span class=\"mwe-math-mathml-inline mwe-math-mathml-a11y\" style=\"display: none;\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"  alttext=\"{\\displaystyle logodds(AbeatsB|v_{a},v_{b})=v_{a}-v_{b}}\">\n  <semantics>\n    <mrow class=\"MJX-TeXAtom-ORD\">\n      <mstyle displaystyle=\"true\" scriptlevel=\"0\">\n        <mi>l</mi>\n        <mi>o</mi>\n        <mi>g</mi>\n        <mi>o</mi>\n        <mi>d</mi>\n        <mi>d</mi>\n        <mi>s</mi>\n        <mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo>\n        <mi>A</mi>\n        <mi>b</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>a</mi>\n        <mi>t</mi>\n        <mi>s</mi>\n        <mi>B</mi>\n        <mrow class=\"MJX-TeXAtom-ORD\">\n          <mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo>\n        </mrow>\n        <msub>\n          <mi>v</mi>\n          <mrow class=\"MJX-TeXAtom-ORD\">\n            <mi>a</mi>\n          </mrow>\n        </msub>\n        <mo>,</mo>\n        <msub>\n          <mi>v</mi>\n          <mrow class=\"MJX-TeXAtom-ORD\">\n            <mi>b</mi>\n          </mrow>\n        </msub>\n        <mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo>\n        <mo>=</mo>\n        <msub>\n          <mi>v</mi>\n          <mrow class=\"MJX-TeXAtom-ORD\">\n            <mi>a</mi>\n          </mrow>\n        </msub>\n        <mo>&#x2212;<!-- \u2212 --></mo>\n        <msub>\n          <mi>v</mi>\n          <mrow class=\"MJX-TeXAtom-ORD\">\n            <mi>b</mi>\n          </mrow>\n        </msub>\n      </mstyle>\n    </mrow>\n    <annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">{\\displaystyle logodds(AbeatsB|v_{a},v_{b})=v_{a}-v_{b}}</annotation>\n  </semantics>\n</math></span><img src=\"https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a51e04d18d6194782a1a8da54087b367873b6343\" class=\"mwe-math-fallback-image-inline\" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"vertical-align: -0.838ex; width:34.353ex; height:2.843ex;\" alt=\"{\\displaystyle logodds(AbeatsB|v_{a},v_{b})=v_{a}-v_{b}}\"/></span></dd></dl>\n<p>Before the availability of modern computers, the mathematics needed to calculate the 'values' of each object's quality meant that the method could only be used with small sets of objects, and its application was limited. For Thurstone, the objects were generally sensations, such as intensity, or attitudes, such as the seriousness of crimes, or statements of opinions. Social researchers continued to use the method, as did market researchers for whom the objects might be different hotel room layouts, or variations on a proposed new biscuit.\n</p><p>In the 1970s and 1980s, comparative judgement appeared, almost for the first time in educational assessment, as a theoretical basis or precursor for the new Latent Trait or Item Response Theories. (Andrich, 1978) These models are now standard, especially in item banking and adaptive testing systems.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Re-introduction_in_education\">Re-introduction in education</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Adaptive_comparative_judgement&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Re-introduction in education\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The first published paper using Comparative Judgement in education was Pollitt &amp; Murray (1994), essentially a research paper concerning the nature of the English proficiency scale assessed in the speaking part of Cambridge's CPE exam. The objects were candidates, represented by 2-minute snippets of video recordings from their test sessions, and the judges were Linguistics post-graduate students with no assessment training. The judges compared pairs of video snippets, simply reporting which they thought the better student, and were then clinically interviewed to elicit the reasons for their decisions.\n</p><p>Pollitt then introduced Comparative Judgement to the UK awarding bodies, as a method for comparing the standards of A Levels from different boards. Comparative judgement replaced their existing method which required direct judgement of a script against the official standard of a different board. For the first two or three years of this Pollitt carried out all of the analyses for all the boards, using a program he had written for the purpose. It immediately became the only experimental method used to investigate exam comparability in the UK; the applications for this purpose from 1996 to 2006 are fully described in Bramley (2007).<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In 2004, Pollitt presented a paper at the conference of the International Association for Educational Assessment titled Let's Stop Marking Exams, and another at the same conference in 2009 titled Abolishing Marksism. In each paper the aim was to convince the assessment community that there were significant advantages to using Comparative Judgement in place of marking for some types of assessment. In 2010 he presented a paper at the Association for Educational Assessment \u2013 Europe, How to Assess Writing Reliably and Validly, which presented evidence of the extraordinarily high reliability that has been achieved with Comparative Judgement in assessing primary school pupils'skill in first language English writing.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Adaptive_comparative_judgement\">Adaptive comparative judgement</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Adaptive_comparative_judgement&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Adaptive comparative judgement\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Comparative judgement becomes a viable alternative to marking when it is implemented as an adaptive web-based assessment system. In this, the 'scores' (the model parameter for each object) are re-estimated after each 'round' of judgements in which, on average, each object has been judged one more time. In the next round, each script is compared only to another whose current estimated score is similar, which increases the amount of statistical information contained in each judgement. As a result, the estimation procedure is more efficient than random pairing, or any other pre-determined pairing system like those used in classical comparative judgement applications. (Pollitt, 2012).<sup id=\"cite_ref-p2012_5-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-p2012-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>As with computer-adaptive testing, this adaptivity maximises the efficiency of the estimation procedure, increasing the separation of the scores and reducing the standard errors. The most obvious advantage is that this produces significantly enhanced reliability, compared to assessment by marking, with no loss of validity.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Current_comparative_judgement_projects\">Current comparative judgement projects</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Adaptive_comparative_judgement&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Current comparative judgement projects\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Digital_Assess\">Digital Assess</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Adaptive_comparative_judgement&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Digital Assess\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>The Digital Assess platform is the original adaptive comparative judgement system.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> The system is designed to run at scale deployments of Adaptive Comparative Judgements and has been used around the world in a wide range of contexts.

The reliability of the resulting scores after each script had been judged 16 times was 0.96, considerably higher than in any other reported study of similar writing assessment. Further development of the system has shown that reliability of 0.93 can be reached after about 9 judgements of each script, when the system is no more expensive than single marking but still much more reliable.<sup id=\"cite_ref-p2012_5-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-p2012-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Several projects are underway at present, in England, Scotland, Ireland, Israel, Singapore and Australia.
