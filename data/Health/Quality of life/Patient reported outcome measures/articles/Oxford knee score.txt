The Oxford Knee Score (OKS) is a Patient Reported Outcome questionnaire that was developed to specifically assess the patient's perspective of outcome following Total Knee Arthroplasty. The OKS has subsequently been validated for use in assessing other non-surgical therapies applied to those suffering from issues with the knee.  The OKS consists of twelve questions covering function and pain associated with the knee. It was designed and developed by researchers within the department of Public Health and Primary Health Care  at the University of Oxford in association with surgical colleagues at the Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre.  The benefit to this questionnaire is that it is short, practical, reliable, valid and sensitive to clinically important changes over time.  The Oxford Knee Score is owned, managed and supported by Isis Outcomes, an activity within Isis Innovation Ltd, the Technology Transfer Company for the University of Oxford.
