Workrave is a free software application intended to prevent computer users from developing or aggravating occupational diseases such as carpal tunnel syndrome, repetitive strain injuries, or myopia. The software periodically locks the screen while showing an animated character, “Miss Workrave”, walks the user through various stretching exercises,    urges them to take a coffee break and sets a daily work time limit after which it automatically triggers an action, such as suspend the machine.  The program is cross-platform, and dependent on the GTK+ graphical widget toolkit, and also on other GNOME libraries on Linux.   It is also available for Microsoft Windows. As of December 2014: The official Workrave website implies that the latest stable Workrave release is 1.10, but this is incorrect. In fact, the latest stable release for Linux is 1.10.5,  and the latest stable release for Windows is 1.10.1. [needs update]  The Windows uninstaller was broken in 1.10 and fixed in 1.10.1.
