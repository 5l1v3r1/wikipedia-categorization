The NHS app, which will allow patients to book appointments with their GP, order repeat prescriptions and access their GP record, has been developed by NHS Digital and NHS England.   Both Jeremy Hunt and Matt Hancock (whose family run a software business) have stressed their support for the project.  Hancock presented it as the key a radical overhaul of NHS technology.  Hunt claimed it would mark 'the death-knell of the 8am scramble for GP appointments that infuriates so many patients'.  It can also be used to access NHS 111, set patients' data sharing preferences, record organ donation preferences and end of life care preferences.  Jeremy Hunt laid down “8 challenges” for the development in September 2017: It is to be piloted in Liverpool, Hastings, Bristol, Staffordshire and South Worcestershire from October 2018 and across England in December 2018.  Patients are to be sent a text message from their GP practice inviting them to download the app. From 2019 it is planned to support GP video consultations and connect to an Apple Watch or FitBit. Later development includes plans to link up with the NHS e-Referral Service to allow patients to book hospital or clinic appointments. EMIS is at present the only system that is fully compatible with the app.  NHS App website
