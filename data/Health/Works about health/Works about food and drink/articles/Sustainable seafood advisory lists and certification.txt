Sustainable seafood advisory lists and certification are programs aimed at increasing consumer awareness of the environmental impact and sustainability of their seafood purchasing choices.  California-based Seafood Watch and Marine Conservation Society's fish online are some of the best-known guides. One of the best-known certification programs is Marine Stewardship Council's scheme for consumer seafood products. Other programs include regional guides, such as that produced by the Australian Marine Conservation Society (AMCS). In Canada, SeaChoice produces assessments and recommendations using the traffic light system, while recommendation of restaurants is done by Vancouver Aquarium's Ocean Wise.
