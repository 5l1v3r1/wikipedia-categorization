5 A Day Adventures is an educational computer game developed by eMotion Studios. The game teaches young children the importance of eating fruits and vegetables daily.  It is intended for third-grade level students, and features singing and rapping cartoon fruit and vegetables that explain how they are grown, their nutrition and cooking.   The game was published and produced by the Dole Food Company, in collaboration with the Society for Nutrition Education and Behavior. Since the release, it has been made freely available to more than 18,000 schools across the United States and was bundled with the Macintosh Quadra 630 series.
