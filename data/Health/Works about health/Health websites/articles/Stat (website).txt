Stat (stylized STAT, sometimes also called Stat News)  is a health-oriented news website launched on November 4, 2015 by John W. Henry, the owner of The Boston Globe. It is produced by Boston Globe Media and is headquartered in the Globe's own building in Boston.   Its executive editor is Rick Berke, who formerly worked at both the New York Times and Politico.  According to Kelsey Sutton of Politico, the website is Henry's "biggest and most ambitious standalone site yet".  The site's name comes from the term "stat," short for statim, or "immediately"â€”a term that has long been used in medical contexts. As of February 2016, it had 45 staff members.  Notable stories Stat has broken include one about Robert Califf's research, published after then-President of the United States Barack Obama announced he would be his nominee to lead the Food and Drug Administration. The site also uncovered claims made by a vitamin company to which President Donald Trump had licensed his name. The site's reporting has also inspired another presidential candidate, Bernie Sanders, to return a contribution a disgraced former pharmaceutical industry CEO made to his campaign.  The site has also sent multiple journalists to Colombia, Haiti, and Brazil to cover the zika outbreaks there.
