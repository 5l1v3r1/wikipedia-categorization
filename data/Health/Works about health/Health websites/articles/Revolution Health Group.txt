Revolution Health Group was a United States-based corporation founded in July 2005 by Steve Case, who previously co-founded America Online.  Revolution Healthâ€™s stated mission is to change healthcare by giving people the tools, information and support to manage their health and wellness actively. Revolution Health Group was one of three companies in the Revolution LLC group of companies. Revolution Health is a health-related portal site and social network that some have described as akin to WebMD. The company portal  launched on January 20, 2007, using Ruby on Rails technology. On October 25, 2007, the company dismissed 60 employees, or a quarter of its work-force, ostensibly as part of a restructuring. On May 23, 2008, RHG terminated its employer business unit and business-to-business unit as well as laying off an additional 50 people. On October 3, 2008, Revolution Health announced that it would merge with Waterfront Media, which operates the Everyday Health Network, in a deal valued at $300 million.  The combined company was projected to have more than 20 million unique users*, according to a comScore research custom report.
