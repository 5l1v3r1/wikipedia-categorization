Proof of Heaven: A Neurosurgeon's Journey into the Afterlife is a 2012 auto-biographical book written by the American neurosurgeon Eben Alexander III. It relates and discusses his memories of experiences during a coma. In the fall of 2008, Alexander, a doctor at Lynchburg General Hospital in Virginia, contracted a very rare bacterial meningitis and spent seven days in a coma. During this state, Alexander experienced something that gave him reason to believe in consciousness after death. In this book Alexander relates the details of his experience from the point of view of a neurosurgeon and discusses how this has affected his views on life, philosophy and medicine. Proof of Heaven reached the top 10 list in USA Today's 150 top selling titles.
