dLife is a half-hour-long American weekly lifestyle television series broadcasting Sundays at 7 PM ET on CNBC. The show, which started airing in 2005, is the first television program dedicated entirely to people living with diabetes and the people who care for them. As of 2013, dLife TV is now available online only and no longer appears on CNBC. dLife is anchored by Benno C. Schmidt III, a veteran network and local broadcast journalist and anchor,  along with co-host Jim Turner, who both live with diabetes.
