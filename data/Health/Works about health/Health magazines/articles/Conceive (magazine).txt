Conceive Magazine is a health and lifestyle publication that provides information about women's health and fertility, about various methods of conception (natural, alternative, assisted and high-tech), and about adoption. The magazine has its headquarters in Orlando, Florida.  Conceive was founded by Kim Hahn  and offers information and support to women interested in starting or expanding their families. The content also includes articles on nutrition, exercise, emotional wellbeing, sex, and relationship issues. The magazine also covers early (first trimester) pregnancy.  In addition to the magazine, the Conceive brand includes a website (www.conceiveonline.com), e-newsletters, and three books (The Fertility Journal, Fertility Facts, and Cooking to Conceive, all published by Chronicle Books).  In October 2009 Conceive was acquired by the Bonnier Corporation, the U.S. branch of a large Swedish media company, with over 50 titles in the United States. Conceive joined Bonnier's "Parenting Group," which includes the magazines Parenting, Babytalk, and Working Mother.
