The magazine focuses on behavior and covers a range of topics including psychology, neuroscience, relationships, sexuality, parenting, health (including from the perspectives of alternative medicine), work,  and the psychological aspects of current affairs.  The magazine's website features therapy and health professionals directories  and hundreds of blogs written by a wide variety of psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, medical doctors, anthropologists, sociologists, and science journalists. Its current editor-in-chief is Kaja Perina.  In 1976 Psychology Today sold 1,026,872 copies.  The circulation of the magazine was 1,171,362 copies in 1981 and 862,193 copies in 1986.  It has a circulation of 250,000 copies per issue as of 2017 and claims 15.02 people read each copy for a total audience of 3,755,000.  From June 2010 to June 2011, it was the one of the top ten consumer magazines by newsstand sales.  In recent years, while many magazines have suffered in readership declines, Adweek, in 2013, noted Psychology Today's 36 percent increase in number of readers.  Owned and managed by the American Psychological Association from 1983 to 1987,  the publication is currently endorsed by the National Board for Certified Counselors, which promotes subscriptions and offers professional credit for a small fee and assigned assessment for each article read.
