Diabetes Health magazine, published by King's Publishing in California, United States, is one of the US's biggest magazines focusing on diabetes and the complications that are the everyday concern of people with this disease and also their families and friends. After starting a mail-order diabetes supply business in 1989, the company realized that customers needed information as well as supplies. Soon “Diabetes on the Dial,” a radio show featuring interviews of world-class experts in the field of diabetes, was born. The demand for transcripts of the broadcasts lead to the company publishing a monthly magazine, originally named Diabetes Interview, now named Diabetes Health. Published continuously for 24 years, Diabetes Health magazine provides articles about living with diabetes.
