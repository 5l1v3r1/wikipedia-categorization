Born Fitness is an online fitness and nutrition coaching platform developed by New York Times best-selling author and former Men’s Health fitness editor Adam Bornstein.   The company provides personalized fitness and nutrition coaching to clients while also fact-checking the latest health news to ensure the continued development of their fitness programs.   Born Fitness has helped over 50 million people through published content and coaching.    Bornstein founded Born Fitness after realizing his work as a researcher at the University of Colorado and University of Florida was unfulfilling. He pivoted to focus on his writing and desire to help people. Bornstein worked for Men’s Health and Livestrong before founding his own company.    Bornstein’s goal in founding Born Fitness was to “drown out the noise and simplify the approach to wellness.” Born Fitness advises clients on nutrition, physical activity, and lifestyle. Staff frequently address the latest headlines in health news to help clients focus on the big picture. This philosophy also informs the concierge coaching style of Born Fitness. Each client has access to three coaches at the same time: one for fitness, one for nutrition and one for lifestyle, accountability and consistency. Despite the large and growing community surrounding Born Fitness, Bornstein prides himself on knowing every client by name.   Explaining the inaccuracies or exaggerations behind popular health media, like the infamous 7-minute-workout,  is vital to Bornstein’s philosophy of teaching self-belief.
