Sulfuric acid poisoning refers to ingestion of sulfuric acid, found in lead-acid batteries and some metal cleaners, pool cleaners,  drain cleaners and anti-rust products. For superficial injuries, washing (therapeutic irrigation) is important. Emergency treatments include protecting the airway, which might involve a tracheostomy. Further treatment will vary depending on the severity, but might include investigations to determine the extent of damage (bronchoscopy for the airways and endoscopy for the gastointestinal tract), followed by treatments including surgery (to debride and repair) and intravenous fluids.  Gastric lavage is contraindicated in corrosive acid poisoning like sulfuric acid poisoning. Bicarbonate is also contraindicated as it liberates carbon dioxide which can cause gastric dilatation leading to rupture of stomach. Vitriolage is the act of throwing sulfuric acid or other corrosive acids on somebody's face.
