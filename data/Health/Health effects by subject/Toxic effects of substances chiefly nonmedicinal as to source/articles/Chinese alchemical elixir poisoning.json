It listed mercury and lead as the prime ingredients for elixirs, which limited later potential experiments and resulted in numerous cases of poisoning. It is quite possible that \"many of the most brilliant and creative alchemists fell victim to their own experiments by taking dangerous elixirs\" (Needham et al. 1976: 74). There is a famous story about <a href=\"/wiki/Animal_testing\" title=\"Animal testing\">animal testing</a> of elixirs by Wei Boyang. Wei entered the mountains to prepare the elixir of immortality, accompanied by three disciples, two of whom were skeptical. When the alchemy was completed he said, \"Although the gold elixir is now accomplished we ought first to test it by feeding it to a white dog. If the dog can fly after taking it then it is edible for man; if the dog dies then it is not.\" The dog fell over and died, but Wei and his disciple Yu took the medicine and immediately died, after which the two cautious disciples fled. Wei and Yu later revived, rejoiced in their faith, took more of the elixir and became immortals (Needham and Ho 1970: 322).\n</p><p>Elixir ingestion is first mentioned in the c. 81 BCE <i><a href=\"/wiki/Discourses_on_Salt_and_Iron\" title=\"Discourses on Salt and Iron\">Discourses on Salt and Iron</a></i> (Pregadio 2000: 166).\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Six_dynasties\">Six dynasties</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Chinese_alchemical_elixir_poisoning&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Six dynasties\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>During the turbulent <a href=\"/wiki/Six_dynasties\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Six dynasties\">Six dynasties</a> period (220-589), <a href=\"/wiki/Self-experimentation\" title=\"Self-experimentation\">self-experimentation</a> with drugs became commonplace, and many people tried taking poisonous elixirs of immortality as well as the <a href=\"/wiki/Psychoactive_drug\" title=\"Psychoactive drug\">psychoactive drug</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Cold-Food_Powder\" title=\"Cold-Food Powder\">Cold-Food Powder</a>. At this time, Daoist alchemists began to record the often fatal side effects of elixirs. In an unusual case of involuntary elixir poisoning, Empress <a href=\"/wiki/Jia_Nanfeng\" title=\"Jia Nanfeng\">Jia Nanfeng</a> (257-300) was forced to commit suicide by drinking \"jinxiaojiu\" \u91d1\u5c51\u9152 \"wine with gold fragments\" (Needham and Ho 1970: 326).\n</p><p>The Daoist scholar <a href=\"/wiki/Ge_Hong\" title=\"Ge Hong\">Ge Hong</a>'s c. 320 <i><a href=\"/wiki/Baopuzi\" title=\"Baopuzi\">Baopuzi</a></i> lists 56 chemical preparations and elixirs, 8 of which were poisonous, with visions from mercury poisoning the most commonly reported symptom (Needham et al. 1976: 89-96).\n</p><p>The individuals who experimented with Six Dynasties alchemy often had different understandings and intentions. A single alchemical formula could be interpreted as being \"suicidal, therapeutic, or symbolic and contemplative\", and its implementation might be \"a unique, decisive event or a repeated, ritual phantasmagoria\" (Strickmann 1979: 192).\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Emperor_Ai_of_Jin\" title=\"Emperor Ai of Jin\">Emperor Ai of Jin</a> (r. 361-365) died at the age of twenty-five, as the result of his desire to avoid growing old.

The <i><a href=\"/wiki/Book_of_Wei\" title=\"Book of Wei\">Book of Wei</a></i> records that in 400, he instituted the office of the Royal Alchemist, built an imperial laboratory for the preparation of drugs and elixirs, and reserved the Western mountains for the supply of firewood (used in the alchemical furnaces). \"Furthermore, he ordered criminals who had been sentenced to death to test (the products) against their will. Many of them died and (the experiments gave) no decisive result.\" (tr. Needham and Ho 1970: 321).\n</p><p>Many texts from the Six dynasties period specifically warned about the toxicity of elixirs. For instance, the <a href=\"/wiki/Shangqing_School\" title=\"Shangqing School\">Shangqing School</a> Daoist pharmacologist <a href=\"/wiki/Tao_Hongjing\" title=\"Tao Hongjing\">Tao Hongjing</a>'s 499 <i><a href=\"/wiki/Zhen%27gao\" title=\"Zhen&#39;gao\">Zhen'gao</a></i> (\u771f\u8aa5, Declarations of the Perfected) describes taking a White Powder elixir.\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>When you have taken a spatulaful of it, you will feel an intense pain in your heart, as if you had been stabbed there with a knife. After three days you will want to drink, and when you have drunk a full <i>hu</i> <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%96%9B\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikt:\u659b\">\u659b</a> [about 50 liters] your breath will be cut off. When that happens, it will mean that you are dead. When your body has been laid out, it will suddenly disappear, and only your clothing will remain. Thus you will be an immortal released in broad daylight by means of his waistband. If one knows the name of the drug [or, perhaps, the secret names of its ingredients] he will not feel the pain in his heart, but after he has drunk a full <i>hu</i> he will still die. When he is dead, he will become aware that he has left his corpse below him on the ground. At the proper time, jade youths and maidens will come with an azure carriage to take it away. If one wishes to linger on in the world, he should strictly regulate his drinking during the three days when he feels the pain in his heart. This formula may be used by the whole family. (tr. Strickmann 1979: 137-138) </p></blockquote>\n<p>Within this context, Strickmann says a prospective Daoist alchemist must have been strongly motivated by faith and a firm confidence in his posthumous destiny, in effect, \"he would be committing suicide by consecrated means.\" Tao Hongjing's disciple Zhou Ziliang \u5468\u5b50\u826f (497\u2013516) had repeated visions of Maoshan divinities who said his destiny was to become an immortal, and instructed him to commit <a href=\"/wiki/Ritual_suicide\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Ritual suicide\">ritual suicide</a> with a poisonous elixir composed of mushrooms and cinnabar (Strickmann 1994: 40). In 517, Tao edited the <i>Zhoushi mingtong ji</i> \u5468\u6c0f\u51a5\u901a\u8a18 (Records of Mr. Zhou's Communications with the Unseen) detailing his disciples visions.\n</p><p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Liang_dynasty\" title=\"Liang dynasty\">Liang dynasty</a> founder <a href=\"/wiki/Emperor_Wu_of_Liang\" title=\"Emperor Wu of Liang\">Emperor Wu</a> (r. 502-549) was cautious about taking elixirs of immortality. He and Tao Hongjing were old friends, and the <i><a href=\"/wiki/History_of_the_Southern_Dynasties\" title=\"History of the Southern Dynasties\">History of the Southern Dynasties</a></i> says the emperor requested him to study elixir alchemy. After Tao had learned the secret art of making elixirs, he was worried about the shortage of materials. \"So the emperor supplied him with gold, cinnabar, copper sulphate, realgar, and so forth. When the process was accomplished the elixirs had the appearance of frost and snow and really did make the body feel lighter. The emperor took an elixir and found it effective.\" (tr. Needham et al. 1976: 120). Tao spent his last years working on different elixirs and presented three to the emperor, who had refused immortality elixirs from Deng Yu \u9127\u90c1 (who claimed to have lived 30 years without food, only consuming pieces of mica in stream water).\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Emperor_Wenxuan_of_Northern_Qi\" title=\"Emperor Wenxuan of Northern Qi\">Emperor Wenxuan</a> (r. 550-559) of the <a href=\"/wiki/Northern_Qi\" title=\"Northern Qi\">Northern Qi</a> dynasty was an early skeptic about immortality elixirs. He ordered alchemists to make the <i>jiuhuan jindan</i> \u4e5d\u9084\u91d1\u4e39 (Ninefold Cyclically Transformed Elixir), which he kept in a jade box, and explained, \"I am still too fond of the pleasures of the world to take flight to the heavens immediately\u2014I intend to consume the elixir only when I am about to die.\" (tr.

In the 9th century Tang imperial <a href=\"/wiki/Order_of_succession\" title=\"Order of succession\">order of succession</a>, two father-son emperor pairs died from elixirs: first Xianzong (r. 805-820) and Muzong (r. 820-824), then Wuzong (r. 840-846) and Xuanzong (r. 847-859). In <a href=\"/wiki/Historic_recurrence\" title=\"Historic recurrence\">historic recurrences</a>, the newly enthroned emperor understandably executed the Daoist alchemists whose elixirs had killed his father, and then subsequently came to believe in other charlatans enough to consume their poisonous elixirs (Ho 2000: 184).\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Emperor_Xianzong_of_Tang\" title=\"Emperor Xianzong of Tang\">Emperor Xianzong</a> (r. 805-820) indirectly lost his life due to elixir poisoning. The <i>Xu Tongzhi</i> (Supplement to the Historical Collections) says, \"Deluded by the sayings of the alchemists, [Xianzong] ingested gold elixirs and his behaviour became very abnormal. He was easily offended by those officials whom he daily met, and thus the prisons were left with little vacant space.\" (tr. Needham and Ho 1970: 317). In response, an official wrote an 819 <a href=\"/wiki/Memorial_to_the_throne\" title=\"Memorial to the throne\">memorial to the throne</a> that said:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>Of late years, however, (the capital) has been overrun by a host of pharmacists and alchemists \u2026 recommending one another right and left with ever wilder and more extravagant claims. Now if there really were immortals, and scholars possessing the Tao, would they not conceal their names and hide themselves in mountain recesses far from the ken of man? \u2026 The medicines of the sages of old were meant to cure bodily illnesses, and were not meant to be taken constantly like food. How much less so these metallic and mineral substances which are full of burning poison! ... Of old, as the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Book_of_Rites\" title=\"Book of Rites\">Li Chi</a></i> says, when the prince took physic, his minister tasted it first, and when a parent was sick, his son did likewise. Ministers and sons are in the same position. I humbly pray that all those persons who have elixirs made from transformed metals and minerals, and also those who recommend them, may be compelled to consume (their own elixirs) first for the space of one year. Such an investigation will distinguish truth from falsehood, and automatically clarify the matter by experiment. (abridged, tr. Needham and Ho 1970: 318) </p></blockquote>\n<p>After the emperor rejected this appeal, the palace <a href=\"/wiki/Eunuchs\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Eunuchs\">eunuchs</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Wang_Shoucheng\" title=\"Wang Shoucheng\">Wang Shoucheng</a> and Chen Hongzhi \u9673\u5f18\u5fd7 assassinated him in 820.\n</p><p>When Xianzong's son and successor <a href=\"/wiki/Emperor_Muzong_of_Tang\" title=\"Emperor Muzong of Tang\">Emperor Muzong</a> (r. 820-824) came to the throne, he executed the alchemists who had poisoned his father, but later began to take immortality elixirs himself. An official wrote Muzong an 823 memorial that warned:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>Medicines are for use against illnesses, and should not be taken as food. \u2026 Even when one is ill medicines must be used with great circumspection; how much more so when one is not ill. If this is true for the common people how much more so will it be for the emperor! Your imperial predecessor believed the nonsense of the alchemists and thus became ill; this your majesty already knows only too well. How could your majesty still repeat the same mistake? (tr. Needham and Ho 1970: 319) </p></blockquote>\n<p>The emperor appreciated this reasoning but soon afterwards fell ill and died from poisoning. Palace eunuchs supposedly used poisonous elixirs to assassinate Muzong's young successor <a href=\"/wiki/Emperor_Jingzong_of_Tang\" title=\"Emperor Jingzong of Tang\">Emperor Jingzong</a> (r. 824-827) (Needham et al. 1976: 151, 182).\n</p><p>The next Tang emperor to die from elixir poisoning was <a href=\"/wiki/Emperor_Wuzong_of_Tang\" title=\"Emperor Wuzong of Tang\">Wuzong</a> (r. 840-846). According to the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Old_Book_of_Tang\" title=\"Old Book of Tang\">Old Book of Tang</a></i>, \"The emperor [Wuzong] favoured alchemists, took some of their elixirs, cultivated the arts of longevity and personally accepted (Taoist) talismans. The medicines made him very irritable, losing all normal self-control in joy or anger; finally when his illness took a turn for the worse he could not speak for ten days at a time.\" <a href=\"/wiki/Chancellor_of_the_Tang_dynasty\" title=\"Chancellor of the Tang dynasty\">Chancellor</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Li_Deyu\" title=\"Li Deyu\">Li Deyu</a> and others requested audiences with the emperor, but he refused and subsequently died in 846 (Needham and Ho 1970: 319).\n</p><p>Wuzong's successor <a href=\"/wiki/Emperor_Xu%C4%81nzong_of_Tang\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Emperor Xu\u0101nzong of Tang\">Emperor Xu\u0101nzong</a> (r. 846-849) astonishingly also died of elixir poisoning. Xu\u0101nzong made himself the patron of some Daoists who concocted immortality elixirs of vegetable origin, possibly because his father Wuzong had died from metallic and mineral elixir poisoning (Needham et al. 1976: 146). The <i><a href=\"/wiki/New_Book_of_Tang\" title=\"New Book of Tang\">New Book of Tang</a></i> records that the emperor received a wine tincture of ivy (\u5e38\u6625\u85e4, <i><a href=\"/wiki/Hedera_helix\" title=\"Hedera helix\">Hedera helix</a></i>) that the Daoist adept Jiang Lu \u59dc\u650e claimed would turn white hair black and provide longevity. However, when the emperor heard that many people died a violent death after drinking ivy tincture, he stopped taking it. Jiang was publicly shamed and the emperor granted his request to search in the mountains for the right plant, but he never appeared again (Needham et al. 1976: 147). According to the 890 <i>Dongguan zuoji</i> (Record of Memorials from the Eastern Library), \"A medical official, Li [Xuanbo], presented to the emperor [Xuanzong] cinnabar which had been heated and subdued by fire, in order to gain favour from him. Thus the ulcerous disease of the emperor was all attributable to his crime.\" (tr. Needham and Ho 1970: 319).\n</p><p>Besides emperors, many Tang <a href=\"/wiki/Scholar-official\" title=\"Scholar-official\">literati</a> were interested in alchemy. Both <a href=\"/wiki/Li_Bai\" title=\"Li Bai\">Li Bai</a> (Waley 1950: 55-56) and <a href=\"/wiki/Bai_Juyi\" title=\"Bai Juyi\">Bai Juyi</a> (Ho, Goh, and Parker 1974) wrote poems about the <i>Cantong qi</i> and alchemical elixirs. Other poets, including <a href=\"/wiki/Meng_Haoran\" title=\"Meng Haoran\">Meng Haoran</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Liu_Yuxi\" title=\"Liu Yuxi\">Liu Yuxi</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Liu_Zongyuan\" title=\"Liu Zongyuan\">Liu Zongyuan</a> also referred to elixir compounding in their works (Pregadio 2000: 171).\n</p><p>The influential Tang physician and alchemist <a href=\"/wiki/Sun_Simiao\" title=\"Sun Simiao\">Sun Simiao</a>'s c. 640 alchemical <i>Taiqing zhenren dadan</i> \u592a\u6e05\u771f\u4eba\u5927\u4e39 (Great Purity Essentials of Elixir Manuals for Oral Transmission) recommends 14 elixir formulas he found successful, most of which seem poisonous, containing mercury and lead, if not arsenic, as ingredients (Needham et al. 1976: 133). Sun's medical c. 659 <i>Qianjin yifang</i> \u5343\u91d1\u8981\u65b9 (Supplement to the Thousand Golden Remedies) categorically states that mercury, realgar, orpiment, sulphur, gold, silver, and vitriol are poisonous, but prescribed them in much larger amounts for elixirs than for medicines. In contrast to drinking soluble arsenic (as in <a href=\"/wiki/Arsenic_contamination_of_groundwater\" title=\"Arsenic contamination of groundwater\">groundwater</a>), when powdered arsenic is eaten \"astonishing degrees of tolerance can be achieved\", and Sun Simiao might have thought that when human beings reached to a level \"approaching that of the immortals their bodies would no longer be susceptible to poison\" (Needham et al. 1976: 135).\n</p><p>Tang alchemists were well aware of elixir poisoning. The c. 8th-9th century <i>Zhenyuan miaodao yaol\u00fce</i> \u771f\u5143\u5999\u9053\u8981\u7565 (Synopsis of the Essentials of the Mysterious Dao of the True Origin) lists 35 common mistakes in elixir preparation: cases where people died from eating elixirs made from cinnabar, mercury, lead, and silver; cases where people suffered from boils on the head and sores on the back by ingesting cinnabar prepared by roasting together mercury and sulphur, and cases where people became seriously ill through drinking melted \"liquid lead\" (Needham and Ho 1970: 330). The c. 850 <i>Xuanjie lu</i> \u7384\u89e3\u9304 (Record of Mysterious Antidotes)\u2014which is notable as the world's oldest printed book on a scientific subject\u2014recommends a potent herbal composition that serves both as an elixir and as an antidote for common elixir poisoning (Needham and Ho 1970: 335). The procedure to make <i>Shouxian wuzi wan</i> \u5b88\u4ed9\u4e94\u5b50\u4e38 (Five-herbs Immortality-safeguarding Pills) is to take 5 ounces each of <a href=\"/wiki/Phyllanthus_emblica\" title=\"Phyllanthus emblica\">Indian gooseberry</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Rubus_coreanus\" title=\"Rubus coreanus\">wild raspberry</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Cuscuta_japonica\" title=\"Cuscuta japonica\">dodder</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Schisandra_chinensis\" title=\"Schisandra chinensis\">five-flavor berry</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Plantago_major\" title=\"Plantago major\">broadleaf plantain</a> and pound them into flour. Mix it with <a href=\"/wiki/Lycium_chinense\" title=\"Lycium chinense\">boxthorn</a> juice and <a href=\"/wiki/Eclipta_prostrata\" title=\"Eclipta prostrata\">false daisy</a> juice and dry. Heat almonds and good wine in a silver vessel, and add <i><a href=\"/wiki/Rehmannia_glutinosa\" title=\"Rehmannia glutinosa\">foxglove</a></i>, tofu, and \"deer glue\". Combine this with the five herbs, and dry into small pills. The usual dosage is 30 pills a day taken with wine, but one should avoid eating pork, garlic, mustard, and turnips when taking the medicine (Needham and Ho 1970: 335).\n</p><p>During the Tang period, Chinese alchemists divided into two schools of thought about elixir poisoning. The first altogether ignored the poison danger and considered the unpleasant symptoms after taking an elixir as signs of its efficacacy. The c. 6th century <i>Taiqing shibi ji</i> \u592a\u6e05\u77f3\u58c1\u8a18 (Records of the Rock Chamber) described away the side effects and recommended methods of bringing relief. \n</p>\n<blockquote><p>After taking an elixir, if your face and body itch as though insects were crawling over them, if your hands and feet swell dropsically, if you cannot stand the smell of food and bring it up after you have eaten it, if you feel as though you were going to be sick most of the time, if you experience weakness in the four limbs, if you have to go often to the latrine, or if your head or stomach violently ache\u2014do not be alarmed or disturbed. All these effects are merely proofs that the elixir you are taking is successfully dispelling your latent disorders. (tr. Needham and Lu 1974: 283) </p></blockquote>\n<p>Many of these symptoms are characteristic of metallic poisoning: <a href=\"/wiki/Formication\" title=\"Formication\">formication</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Edema\" title=\"Edema\">edema</a>, and weakness of the extremities, later leading to infected boils and ulcers, nausea, vomiting, gastric and abdominal pain, diarrhea, and headaches (Needham and Lu 1974: 283). For relieving the side-effects when the elixir takes effect, the <i>Taiqing shibi ji</i> recommends that one should take hot and cold baths, and drink a mixture of scallion, soy sauce, and wine. If that does not bring relief, then one should combine and boil a hornets' nest, <a href=\"/wiki/Spurge\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Spurge\">spurge</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Polygonatum\" title=\"Polygonatum\">Solomon's Seal</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Ephedra\" title=\"Ephedra\">Ephedra</a> into a medicine and take one dose (Needham and Ho 1970: 331).\n</p><p>The second school of alchemists, admitted that some metal and mineral elixir constituents were poisonous and tried either to neutralize them or to replace them with less dangerous herbal substances (Needham et al. 1976: 182). For instance, the 8th-century <i>Zhang zhenren jinshi lingsha lun</i> \u5f35\u771f\u4eba\u91d1\u77f3\u9748\u6c99\u8ad6 (The Adept Zhang's Discourse on Metals, Minerals, and Cinnabar) emphasized the poisonous nature of gold, silver, lead, mercury, and arsenic, and described witnessing many cases of premature death brought about by consuming cinnabar. Zhang believed however that the poisons could be rendered harmless by properly choosing and combining <a href=\"/wiki/Adjuvant\" title=\"Adjuvant\">adjuvant</a> and complimentary ingredients; for example gold should always be used together with mercury, while silver can only be used when combined with gold, <a href=\"/wiki/Basic_copper_carbonate\" title=\"Basic copper carbonate\">copper carbonate</a>, and realgar for the preparation of the <i>jindan</i> Golden Elixir (tr. Needham and Ho 1970: 331). Many Tang alchemical writers returned to the fashion of using obscure synonyms for ingredients, perhaps because of the alarming number of elixir poisonings, and the desire to dissuade amateur alchemists from experimenting on themselves (Needham et al. 1976: 138). By the end of the <a href=\"/wiki/Yuan_dynasty\" title=\"Yuan dynasty\">Yuan dynasty</a> (1271-1368), the more cautious alchemists had generally changed the elixirs ingredients from minerals and metals to plants and animals (Ho and Lisowski 1997: 39).\n</p><p>The late Tang or early Song <i>Huangdi jiuding shendan jingjue</i> \u9ec4\u5e1d\u4e5d\u9f0e\u795e\u4e39\u7d93\u8a23 (Explanation of the Yellow Emperor's Manual of the Nine-Vessel Magical Elixir) says, \"The ancient masters (lit. sages) all attained longevity and preserved their lives (lit. bones) by consuming elixirs. But later disciples (lit. scholars) have suffered loss of life and decay of their bones as the result of taking them.\" The treatise explains the secret ancient methods for rendering elixir ingredients harmless by treating them with wine made from <i><a href=\"/wiki/Vitex_negundo\" title=\"Vitex negundo\">chastetree</a></i> leaves and roots, or with <a href=\"/wiki/Saltpeter\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Saltpeter\">saltpeter</a> and vinegar. Another method of supposedly removing the poison from mercury was to put it in three-year-old wine, add <a href=\"/wiki/Sal_ammoniac\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sal ammoniac\">sal ammoniac</a> and boil it for 100 days (Needham and Ho 1970: 332-3).\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Five_dynasties\">Five dynasties</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Chinese_alchemical_elixir_poisoning&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Five dynasties\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Two rulers died from elixir poisoning during the <a href=\"/wiki/Five_Dynasties\" title=\"Five Dynasties\">Five Dynasties</a> period (907-979) of political turmoil after the overthrow of the Tang dynasty. <a href=\"/wiki/Zhu_Wen\" title=\"Zhu Wen\">Zhu Wen</a> or Emperor Taizu (r. 907-912), the founder of the <a href=\"/wiki/Later_Liang_(Five_Dynasties)\" title=\"Later Liang (Five Dynasties)\">Later Liang dynasty</a>, became seriously incapacitated as a result of elixir poisoning, and fell victim to an assassination plot. <a href=\"/wiki/Li_Bian\" title=\"Li Bian\">Li Bian</a> or Emperor Liezu (r. 937-943), the founder of the <a href=\"/wiki/Southern_Tang\" title=\"Southern Tang\">Southern Tang</a> kingdom, took immortality elixirs that made him irritable and deathly ill (Needham et al. 1976: 180).\n</p><p>The Daoist adept <a href=\"/wiki/Chen_Tuan\" title=\"Chen Tuan\">Chen Tuan</a> (d. 989) advised two emperors that they should not worry about elixirs but direct their minds to improving the state administration, <a href=\"/wiki/Chai_Rong\" title=\"Chai Rong\">Chai Rong</a> or Emperor Shizong of <a href=\"/wiki/Later_Zhou\" title=\"Later Zhou\">Later Zhou</a> in 956, and then <a href=\"/wiki/Emperor_Taizu_of_Song\" title=\"Emperor Taizu of Song\">Emperor Taizu of Song</a> in 976 (Needham et al. 1976: 194).\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Song_dynasty\">Song dynasty</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Chinese_alchemical_elixir_poisoning&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: Song dynasty\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>After its heyday in the Tang dynasty Daoist alchemy continued to flourish during the <a href=\"/wiki/Song_dynasty\" title=\"Song dynasty\">Song dynasty</a> (960\u20131279) period. However, since six Tang emperors and many court officials died from elixir poisoning, Song alchemists exercised more caution, not only in the composition of the elixirs themselves, but also in attempts to find pharmaceutical methods of counteracting the toxic effects. The number of ingredients used in elixir formulas was reduced and there was a tendency to return to the ancient and difficult terminology of the <i>Cantongqi</i>, perhaps to conceal the processes from rash and ignorant operators. Psycho-physiological <i>neidan</i> alchemy became steadily more popular than laboratory <i>waidan</i> alchemy (Needham et al. 1976: 208).\n</p><p>During the Song dynasty, the practice of consuming metallic elixirs was not confined to the imperial court and expanded to anyone wealthy enough to pay. The author and official <a href=\"/wiki/Ye_Mengde\" title=\"Ye Mengde\">Ye Mengde</a> (1077\u20131148) described how two of his friends had died from elixirs of immortality in one decade. First, Lin Yanzhen, who boasted about his health and muscular strength, took an elixir for three years, \"Whereupon ulcers developed in his chest, first near the hairs as large as rice-grains, then after a couple of days his neck swelled up so that chin and chest seemed continuous.\" Lin died after ten months of suffering, and his doctors discovered cinnabar powder had accumulated in his pus and blood. Second, whenever Xie Renbo \"heard of anyone who had some cinnabar subdued by fire he went after it, caring nothing about the distance, and his only fear was that he would not have enough.\" He also developed ulcers on the chest.

Based upon early Chinese descriptions of elixir poisoning, they decisively demonstrated a close correspondence with the known medical symptoms of <a href=\"/wiki/Mercury_poisoning\" title=\"Mercury poisoning\">mercury poisoning</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Lead_poisoning\" title=\"Lead poisoning\">lead poisoning</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Arsenic_poisoning\" title=\"Arsenic poisoning\">arsenic poisoning</a>. Compare the historical descriptions of Jin Emperor Ai (d. 365) who \"no longer knew what was going on around him\" and Tang Emperor Wuzong (d. 846) who was \"very irritable, losing all normal self-control in joy or anger \u2026 he could not speak for ten days at a time\" with the distinctive psychological effects of mercury poisoning: progressing from \"abnormal irritability to idiotic, melancholic, or manic conditions\" (1970: 327). Needham and his collaborators further discussed elixir poisoning in the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Science_and_Civilisation_in_China\" title=\"Science and Civilisation in China\">Science and Civilisation in China</a></i> series, particularly Needham and <a href=\"/wiki/Lu_Gwei-djen\" title=\"Lu Gwei-djen\">Lu Gwei-djen</a> (1974), and Needham, Ho, and Lu (1976).\n</p><p>Although Chinese elixir poisoning may lead some to dismiss Chinese alchemy as another example of human follies in history, Ho Peng-Yoke and F. Peter Lisowski note its positive aspect upon Chinese medicine. The caution given to elixir poisoning later led Chinese alchemy to \"shade imperceptibly\" into <a href=\"/wiki/Iatrochemistry\" title=\"Iatrochemistry\">iatrochemistry</a>, the preparation of medicine by chemical methods, \"in other words <a href=\"/wiki/Chemotherapy\" title=\"Chemotherapy\">chemotherapy</a>\" (1997: 39).\n</p><p>A recent study found that Chinese emperors lived comparatively short lives, with a mean age at death of emperors at 41.3, which was significantly lower than that of <a href=\"/wiki/Bhikkhu\" title=\"Bhikkhu\">Buddhist monks</a> at 66.9 and <a href=\"/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine\" title=\"Traditional Chinese medicine\">traditional Chinese doctors</a> at 75.1.

Homicide resulted in a significantly lower age of death (mean age 31.1) than disease (45.6), suicide (38.8), or drug toxicity (43.1, mentioning Qin Shi Huang taking mercury pills of immortality). Lifestyles seem to have been a determining factor, and 93.2% of the emperors studied were overindulgent in drinking alcohol, sexual activity, or both (Zhao et al. 2006: 1295). The study does not refer to the Chinese belief that the arsenic sulphides realgar and orpiment, frequently used in immortality elixirs, had aphrodisiac properties (Needham and Lu 1974: 285).\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Hypothetical_explanations\">Hypothetical explanations</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Chinese_alchemical_elixir_poisoning&amp;action=edit&amp;section=13\" title=\"Edit section: Hypothetical explanations\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>A significant question remains unanswered.

They suggest that in some cases a body did not decompose because the deceased had died from mercury or arsenic poisoning, which is <a href=\"/wiki/Forensic_medicine\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Forensic medicine\">forensically</a> known to often preserve a corpse from decay. For a believer in Daoist immortality drugs, even when an elixir-taker had unmistakably died, if the corpse was comparatively undecomposed, that could be interpreted as proof that the adept had become a <i>xian</i> immortal, as well as evidence for the alchemical elixir's efficacy. (1974: 298).\n</p><p>Terminal incorruptibility was an ancient Chinese belief associated with jade, gold, and cinnabar. The <i><a href=\"/wiki/Baopuzi\" title=\"Baopuzi\">Baopuzi</a></i> says, \"When gold and jade are inserted into the nine orifices, corpses do not decay. When salt and brine are absorbed into flesh and marrow, dried meats do not spoil. So when men ingest substances which are able to benefit their bodies and lengthen their days, why should it be strange that (some of these) should confer life perpetual?\" The abolition of decay was believed to demonstrate the power of elixirs, \"the corruptible had put on incorruptibility\" (Needham and Lu 1974: 284). Chinese <a href=\"/wiki/Jade_burial_suit\" title=\"Jade burial suit\">jade burial suits</a> are a better known example of using a mineral to preserve corpses.\n</p><p>There is a possibility that Sun Simiao (above) died from taking mercury elixirs (Needham and Ho 1970: 330). According to Sun's hagiography in the 10th-century <i>Xuxian zhuan</i> \u7e8c\u4ed9\u50b3 (Further Biographies of the Immortals), after his death in 682 there was no visible sign of putrefaction, \"After more than a month had passed there was no change in his appearance, and when the corpse was raised to be placed in the coffin it was as light as (a bundle of) empty clothes.\" (tr. Needham and Lu 1974:298).\n</p><p>The incorruptibility stories about elixir users were not all myth, and recent archeological evidence showed that the ancient Chinese knew how \"to achieve an almost perpetual conservation\". The 1972 excavation of a tomb at <a href=\"/wiki/Mawangdui\" title=\"Mawangdui\">Mawangdui</a> discovered the extremely well-preserved body of <a href=\"/wiki/Xin_Zhui\" title=\"Xin Zhui\">Xin Zhui</a> or Lady Dai, which resembled that of \"a person who had died only a week or two before\" (Needham and Lu 1974: 303-304). A subsequent autopsy on her corpse found \"abnormally high levels\" of mercury and lead in her internal organs (Brown 2002: 213).\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Temporary_death\">Temporary death</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Chinese_alchemical_elixir_poisoning&amp;action=edit&amp;section=16\" title=\"Edit section: Temporary death\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Needham and Lu's third justification for taking poisonous elixirs is a drug-induced \"temporary death\", possibly a trance or coma. In the classic legend (above) about Wei Boyang drinking an elixir of immortality, he appears to die, subsequently revives, and takes more elixir to achieve immortality.\n</p><p>The <i><a href=\"/wiki/Baopuzi\" title=\"Baopuzi\">Baopuzi</a></i> describes a <a href=\"/wiki/Cold-Food_Powder#Six_Dynasties\" title=\"Cold-Food Powder\">Five Mineral</a>-based multicolored Ninefold Radiance Elixir that can bring a corpse back to life: \"If you wish to raise a body that has not been dead for fully three days, bathe the corpse with a solution of one spatula of the blue elixir, open its mouth, and insert another spatula full; it will revive immediately.\" (tr. Ware 1966:82).\n</p><p>A Tang Daoist text prescribes taking an elixir in doses half the size of a millet grain, but adds, \"If one is sincerely determined, and dares to take a whole spatula-full all at once, one will temporarily die [<i>z\u00e0ns\u01d0</i> \u66ab\u6b7b] for half a day or so, and then be restored to life like someone waking from sleep.

Two reviewers disagreed about Strickmann's conclusions. The first questions why he defends the logic of alchemical suicide rather than simply accepting the idea of accidental elixir poisoning, and says Tao Hongjing never experimented with alchemy seriously enough to achieve suicide himself\u2014but fails to mention Strickmann's prime example: Tao's disciple Zhou Ziliang whom Shangqing deities reportedly instructed to prepare a poisonous elixir and commit suicide in order to achieve immortality (Chen 1981: 547). The second describes Strickmann's chapter as \"one of the most thorough and useful\" in the volume, and says he proves that it is \"almost ludicrous to assume that a Taoist (commoner or emperor) could have died from <i>accidental</i> elixir poisoning\" (Cass 1982: 92-93).\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Chinese_alchemical_elixir_poisoning&amp;action=edit&amp;section=18\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li>Bokenkamp, Stephen R.
