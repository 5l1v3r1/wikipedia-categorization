The derived no-effect level (DNEL) is the level of exposure to a substance above which humans should not be exposed. According to the EU REACH legislation, manufacturers and importers of chemical substances are required to calculate DNELs as part of their chemical safety assessment (CSA) for any chemicals used in quantities of 10 tonnes or more per year.  The DNEL is to be published in the manufacturerâ€™s chemical safety report (CSR) and, for hazard communication, in an extended safety data sheet.
