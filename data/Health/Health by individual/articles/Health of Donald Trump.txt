 Since the early days of Donald Trump's presidential campaign, his physical and mental health have been a subject of public debate. Trump was seventy years old when he took office, surpassing Ronald Reagan as the oldest person to assume the presidency.  Comments on his age, weight and lifestyle have raised questions about his physical health. In addition, numerous public figures, media sources, and mental health professionals have speculated that Donald Trump may have mental health challenges, ranging from narcissistic personality disorder to some form of dementia. Trump and his supporters have denied these allegations, and have contested the authority and motives of persons making such claims. In December 2015, Trump's personal physician, Harold Bornstein, released a superlative-laden letter of health praising Trump for "extraordinary physical strength and stamina".  Bornstein later said that Trump himself had dictated the contents.  A followup medical report showed Trump's blood pressure, liver and thyroid functions to be in normal ranges, and that he takes a statin.   In January 2018, Trump was examined by White House physician Ronny Jackson, who stated that he was in excellent health, although his weight and cholesterol level were higher than recommended,  and that his cardiac assessment revealed no medical issues.  Several outside cardiologists commented that Trump's weight, lifestyle and LDL cholesterol ought to have raised serious concerns about his cardiac health.  Trump does not drink alcohol;  this decision arose in part from watching his older brother Fred Jr. suffer from alcoholism that contributed to his early death in 1981.   He also said that he has never smoked cigarettes or consumed drugs, including marijuana.  On May 1, 2018, Bornstein told NBC News that three Trump representatives had "raided" his office on February 3, 2017, taking all of Trump's medical records. He identified two of the men as Trump's longtime bodyguard Keith Schiller and the Trump Organization's chief legal officer Alan Garten.  Two days earlier, Bornstein had told a reporter that Trump took a prescription hair growth medicine, Propecia, after which Trump cut ties with him.   As early as November 2015, Vanity Fair reported the opinion of a number of mental health experts that Trump had "[t]extbook narcissistic personality disorder".  Bornstein's letter of December 2015, drafted in response to questions about the health of presidential candidates, did not address Trump's mental health,  while claiming that he would be "the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency".  Bornstein disclosed in 2018 that Trump had dictated this letter over the telephone.  He said: "Mr. Trump dictated the letter and I would tell him what he couldn't put in there."  In August 2016, Bornstein stated that Trump's "health is excellent, especially his mental health."  In February 2016, presidential candidate Jeb Bush speculated that Trump had mental health issues, stating "I'm not a psychiatrist or a psychologist, but the guy needs therapy".   In early 2017, psychologist John Gartner collected more than 25,000 signatures of mental health professionals on a petition, directed to the national opposition leader, Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer.  At the end of April 2017 he was able to forward the petition with more than 41,000 signatures  of mental healthcare professionals to Washington D.C..  The core of the petition stated: My professional judgement is that Donald Trump manifests a serious mental illness that renders him  psychologically incapable of competently discharging the duties of President of the United States. And I respectfully request him [sic] be removed from office, according to article 3 of the 25th Amendment, and so on. Gartner asserted that Trump's mental handicaps are a mix of 1. narcissism, 2. paranoia; 3. sociopathy; and 4. a dash of sadism. On April 14, 2017, Representatives Jamie Raskin and Earl Blumenauer introduced the Oversight Commission on Presidential Capacity Act.  The bill would replace the Cabinet as the body that, together with the Vice President, determines whether to invoke Section 4 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which permits removal of a President who is mentally incapacitated. Under the bill, an eleven-member commission, including four psychiatrists, would conduct an examination of the President when directed to do so by a concurrent resolution of the Congress.   Blumenauer stated: It is hard to imagine a better group to work with the vice president to examine whether the president is able to discharge the duties of the office. When there are questions about the president’s ability to fulfill his or her constitutional responsibilities, it is in the country's best interest to have a mechanism in place that works effectively.                North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un just stated that the “Nuclear Button is on his desk at all times.” Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!                   January 3, 2018               In January 2018, North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un and Trump publicly exchanged claims about their respective "nuclear buttons". In reaction, Richard W. Painter, a former adviser to President George W. Bush, deemed Trump "psychologically unfit" and supported transferring his powers to Vice President Pence under the 25th Amendment.  In April 2018 Vanity Fair reported that Trump's advisers "worry about his mental health" when he is outside the controls available in the White House environment.  In September 2017, Jeanne Suk Gerson wrote in The New Yorker: "A strange consensus does appear to be forming around Trump's mental state," including Democrats and Republicans who doubt Trump's fitness for office.  Journalist Bill Moyers interviewed psychiatrist Robert Jay Lifton and said that Trump "makes increasingly bizarre statements that are contradicted by irrefutable evidence to the contrary". Lifton replied, "He doesn’t have clear contact with reality, though I’m not sure it qualifies as a bona fide delusion." As an example, Lifton said, when Trump claimed that former president Barack Obama was born in Kenya, "he was manipulating that lie as well as undoubtedly believing it in part."  In April 2017 forensic psychiatrist Bandy X. Lee hosted a meeting at Yale University medical school regarding the ethics of discussing Trump's mental health.   In October 2017, Lee published The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump, containing essays from 27 psychologists, psychiatrists, and mental health professionals on the "clear and present danger" that Trump's mental health poses to the "nation and individual well being". They argued that the president's issues affected the mental health of the United States population,  and that he placed the country at grave risk of war because of his pathological traits.  They defined Trump's behavior in terms of psychiatric diseases, such as narcissistic personality disorder.  Carlos Lozada, writing for The Washington Post, considered these conclusions "compelling", but also noted that the book contributors were writing from their own political perspective, as other mental health professionals differ.  Lee and others contend that Trump's presidency represents an emergency allowing, or even requiring, psychiatrists to take exception from the APA's Goldwater rule, which holds that it is unethical for psychiatrists to give a professional opinion about public figures without having examined them in person, and without their consent.   It has been asserted that Trump has signs of some degree of an early stage of dementia, constituting an inability to consistently remember facts, or respond appropriately to circumstances of his surroundings.  On several occasions, Trump has been reported as appearing to have mental lapses. In March 2017, Trump forgot to sign two executive orders before leaving a signing ceremony for those orders.  On July 5, 2017, Trump, after deplaning from Air Force One, appeared confused and wandered away from his waiting limousine.   On October 12, 2017, Trump initially forgot to sign the Trumpcare executive order before leaving the signing ceremony, but was ushered back to the table by Vice President Mike Pence to complete this step.  In July 2018, during a press conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the 2018 Russia–United States summit in Helsinki, Trump made a statement interpreted by observers as indicating his inclination to accept Putin's denial of Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, saying "President Putin says it's not Russia. I don't see any reason why it would be".  Following criticism of this remark, Trump made a statement asserting that this was the result of a mental lapse, stating "In a key sentence in my remarks, I said the word 'would' instead of 'wouldn't'".  Former Republican governor of New Jersey, Christine Todd Whitman wrote of this assertion that if Trump did make this error, "it demonstrates his inability to articulate accurately U.S. foreign policy at the highest level, for the highest stakes".  Trump has dismissed questions regarding his mental health, stating that he is a "very stable genius".  As evidence of his mental capacities, he pointed to his business success, his victory over Republican competitors, and his election to the presidency against Hillary Clinton.  Trump and others have asserted that such questions are evidence of a problem with his critics, labeling them as suffering from a "Trump Derangement Syndrome" (TDS). For example, commenting on the book The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump, RealClearPolitics writer Carl M. Cannon argued that the foreword by psychiatrist Robert Jay Lifton "offers the melodramatic view that clinicians who don't warn the world about Donald Trump's shortcomings are akin to Nazi doctors who worked at Auschwitz. At the risk of practicing medicine without a license, I'd suggest that this historical comparison is de facto evidence of TDS – and paranoid grandiosity".  In response to speculation about his cognitive abilities, Trump was administered the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) at his own request as part of his January 2018 health checkup. He received a score of 30/30, indicating a normal level of cognitive function.  Critics have contended that the MoCA test is too basic to diagnose the problems asserted.
