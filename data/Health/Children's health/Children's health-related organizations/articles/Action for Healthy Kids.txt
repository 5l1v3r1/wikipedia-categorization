Action for Healthy Kids is a public-private partnership of more than 75 organizations  dedicated to promoting school health.  Founded in 2002, the organization addresses the epidemic of overweight, sedentary, and undernourished youth by focusing on changes in schools to improve nutrition and increase physical activity.  Former U.S. Surgeon General David Satcher is the founding chair of the organization.  The organization has active volunteers in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.  Their activities are supported by a variety of organizations, including the Kellogg Company,  the National Dairy Council, and General Mills.  Working with Kellogg, the organization provided financial support to schools to support National School Breakfast Week. They are partners with the National Dairy Council and the National Football League in a program called "Fuel Up To Play 60."
