Children With Cancer UK is a UK-based charity dedicated to raising money for research and providing care for children with cancer and their families. The aims of their research projects are to understand what causes children to get cancer and to develop improved treatments.   Children With Cancer UK was established in 1987 by the O’Gorman family in memory of their son, Paul, who died from leukaemia.  The initial aim was to raise £100,000 for research and support. The O’Gorman family lost a second child to cancer shortly after their first fundraising event (The Paul O’Gorman Banquet and Ball). Subsequently, Diana, Princess of Wales became involved in the charity, which she inaugurated in 1988.  Since 1987, Children With Cancer UK has raised over £220 million,  which is used to support research into the causes and treatment of cancer in children and clinical trials. The charity also funds research centres and respite accommodation for affected families. In 2007, they provided funding for a new £40 million biomedical research lab at the UCL Cancer Institute, named after the deceased Paul O'Gorman.  The charity is assisted by a range of organisations in the UK including Mr Men Little Miss, which supports the charity's London Marathon entrants.  In 2005, Linda Robson joined the Board of Trustees.
