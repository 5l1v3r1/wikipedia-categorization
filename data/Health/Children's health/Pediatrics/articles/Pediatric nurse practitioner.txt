A pediatric nurse practitioner (PNP) is a nurse practitioner that specializes in care to newborns, infants, toddlers, pre-schoolers, school-aged children, adolescents, and young adults. The pediatric nurse practitioner is a specialist in the care of children from birth through young adult with an in-depth knowledge and experience in pediatric primary health care including well child care and prevention/management of common pediatric acute illnesses and chronic conditions.  This care is provided to support optimal health of children within the context of their family, community, and environmental setting.    Following educational preparation at the master's or doctoral level, PNPs must become board certified by an approved certification body.  Board certification must be maintained by obtaining continuing nursing education credits.  In the US, board certification is provided through either the American Nurses Credentialing Center (awards the PPCNP-BC credential), or through the Pediatric Nursing Certification Board (awards the CPNP-AC and the CPNP-PC credentials).   PNPs deliver a range of acute, chronic, and preventive healthcare services.  To align with the Consensus Model for APRN Regulation developed by the National Council of State Boards of Nursing, PNPs are typically classified by whether they practice in an acute care or primary care setting.
