Juvenile osteoporosis is osteoporosis in children and adolescents. Osteoporosis is rare in children and adolescents. When it occurs, it is usually secondary to some other condition,  e.g. osteogenesis imperfecta, rickets, eating disorders or arthritis. In some cases, there is no known cause and it is called idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis. Idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis usually goes away spontaneously.  Also, child abuse should be suspected in recurring cases of bone fracture. Treatment for secondary juvenile osteoporosis focuses on treating any underlying disorder.
