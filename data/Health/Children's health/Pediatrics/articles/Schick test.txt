The Schick test, invented between 1910 and 1911,  is a test used to determine whether or not a person is susceptible to diphtheria.   It was named after its inventor, Béla Schick (1877–1967), a Hungarian-born American pediatrician. The test is a simple procedure.  A small amount (0.1 ml) of diluted (1/50 MLD) diphtheria toxin is injected intradermally into one arm of the person and a heat inactivated toxin on the other as a control.  If a person does not have enough antibodies to fight it off, the skin around the injection will become red and swollen, indicating a positive result.  This swelling disappears after a few days.  If the person has an immunity, then little or no swelling and redness will occur, indicating a negative result. Results can be interpreted as:  The test was created when immunizing agents were scarce and not very safe, however as newer and safer toxoids were made available there was no more requirement for susceptibility tests.
