This phenomenon is referred to as an \"analgesic effect,\" meaning \"pain-relieving effect.\"   Distraction treatments can be divided into passive and active distraction.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Passive_distraction\">Passive distraction</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Psychosocial_treatment_of_needle_phobia_in_children&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Passive distraction\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Passive distraction is defined for the following studies as a form of distraction that commands the child's attention but does not require any participation on the child's part.

There were 23 children in each group; the average age and gender ratios of each group are shown in Table 1.  The mothers in Group M were instructed to \"actively distract their children during the venipuncture by speaking, caressing, and soothing them.\"  The children in Group TV were placed in a room in front of a television; the cartoon started at least two minutes before the venipuncture took place, and the only distraction offered was an invitation for the child to watch the cartoon when it started playing.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Bellieni_5-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Bellieni-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" align=\"center\">\n<caption><b>Mean age and gender ratio in treatment groups</b>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>\n</td>\n<th scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#efefef;\">Group C\n</th>\n<th scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#efefef;\">Group M\n</th>\n<th scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#efefef;\">Group TV\n</th></tr>\n<tr>\n<th scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#efefef;\">Number of Children\n</th>\n<td>23\n</td>\n<td>23\n</td>\n<td>23\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<th scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#efefef;\">Median age (range)\n</th>\n<td>8 (7-12)\n</td>\n<td>9 (7-12)\n</td>\n<td>9 (7-12)\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<th scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#efefef;\">Male/Female ratio\n</th>\n<td>10/13\n</td>\n<td>12/11\n</td>\n<td>11/12\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>This study used the Oucher scale to assess pain in the children.  The Oucher scale, a \"validated visual pain scale scoring from 0 (no pain) to 100 (maximum pain),\" has two separate scales to help children identify their pain level.  The scale from 0 to 100 is placed alongside six photographs of children in various levels of discomfort; children in the report were asked to use the pictures as an aid for choosing a numerical value to represent their pain level.  Parents of the children were also asked to assess their child's pain levels on the same scale, basing their assessment on the child's external indication of pain and not the child's reported score.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Bellieni_5-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Bellieni-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" align=\"center\">\n<caption><b>Average Oucher Scale Ratings by Group</b>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>\n</td>\n<th scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#efefef;\">Mean\n</th>\n<th scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#efefef;\">Standard Deviation\n</th></tr>\n<tr>\n<th scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#efefef;\">Group C\n</th>\n<td>23.04\n</td>\n<td>24.57\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<th scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#efefef;\">Group M\n</th>\n<td>17.39\n</td>\n<td>21.36\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<th scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#efefef;\">Group TV\n</th>\n<td>8.91\n</td>\n<td>8.65\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>The results of Bellieni's study suggest that passive distraction is more effective than active distraction in lessening perceived pain from venipuncture, although active distraction does have some effect in lessening perceived pain.  The average scores on the Oucher scale for Group C, Group M, and Group TV were 23.04, 17.39, and 8.91, respectively; with standard deviation 24.57, 21.36, and 8.65,  also respectively.  Even taking these fluctuations in data into account, it is apparent that the passive distraction technique significantly lowered the perceived pain when compared to the control group and the active distraction group, according to both parents and children.\n</p><p>These results show that distraction by television had a greater analgesic effect than active distraction performed by the mothers.  This is shown by both the children's self-reported scores and the mothers' scores.  Mason <i>et al</i>, who published a study in <i>The Journal of Clinical Psychology in Medical Settings</i>, suggested that while both mothers and television are effective distraction techniques, the mothers may have been less effective because the children's fear and distress could have affected their ability to interact with their mothers.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Influence_of_caregivers\">Influence of caregivers</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Psychosocial_treatment_of_needle_phobia_in_children&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Influence of caregivers\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In the <i>Journal of Holistic Nursing</i>, Cavendar <i>et al</i> performed a study investigating the effect of parents as active distraction to the child.

The control group received standard care, and mothers were present in the room but were not coached on distraction techniques nor given distraction items.  The researchers concluded that \"fear was rated as significantly lower\" in the experimental group, though there was \"no statistical difference between the two groups with regard to pain and distress.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Cavendar_7-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Cavendar-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\"\n</p><p>The way parents act and react in situations where their child is undergoing venipuncture can have an effect on children and their fear of needles.

Unhelpful behaviors included overly reassuring children, overly empathizing with children, apologizing, and criticizing children.  It was also noted that giving the child control of the procedure from the beginning or asking the child to \"indicate readiness to receive the needle\" increased distress in the children.  Other unhelpful responses included \"inadequate or overly forceful restraint by the parent; shaming, threatening, yelling, slapping, lying; or, alternately, pitying, placating, bribing, and helpless parent behaviors.\"  The researchers identified a need to provide instruction to parents on what not to say to their child.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Ives_1-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Ives-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Nurses identified lack of explanation to the child as a major problem in many immunization procedures.
