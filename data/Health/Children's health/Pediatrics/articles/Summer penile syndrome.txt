Summer penile syndrome (also known as 'Lions Mane Penis')  is a seasonal pediatric medical condition characterized by redness, swelling (edema), and itching (pruritus) of the penile skin.  Summer penile syndrome is usually caused by chigger bites on the penis.   Majority of cases occur in the summer months, with the clothing associated with warmer weather making penis-insect contact more likely.
