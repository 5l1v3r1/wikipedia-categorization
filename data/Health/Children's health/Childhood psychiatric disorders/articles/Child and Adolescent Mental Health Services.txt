Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) is the name for NHS-provided services in the United Kingdom for children, generally until school-leaving age, who are having difficulties with their emotional or behavioural well-being.  CAMHS services are organised locally, and the exact services provided may vary, often by local government area.  In the UK CAMHS are organised around a four tier system:  Generally patients cannot self-refer to Tier 3 or 4 services, which are sometimes called specialist CAMHS.  Referrals can be made by a wide range of agencies and professionals, including GPs and school nurses.   The aim is to have a team led by a consultant psychiatrist, although other models exist and there is limited evidence of what system works best. It is suggested that there should be a consultant psychiatrist for a total population of 75,000, although in most of the UK this standard is not met.  The Tier 4 service includes hospital care, with about 1,450 hospital beds provided in England for adolescents aged 13 to 18.  Typical conditions that sometime require hospital care include depression, psychoses, eating disorders and severe anxiety disorders.  The service may, depending on locality, include: The development of CAMHS within a four-tiered framework started in 1995. In 1998, 24 CAMHS Innovation Projects started, and the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 established related youth offending teams. In 2000 the NHS Plan Implementation Programme required health and local authorities to jointly produce a local CAMHS strategy.  In November 2008 the independent CAMHS Review was published.   From about 2013 onward major concerns have been expressed about reductions in CAMHS services, and apparently increasing demand, and in 2014 the parliamentary Health Select Committee investigated and reported on provision.   In 2015 the government published a review,   and promised a funding increase of about £250 million per year. However the funds were not ring-fenced and as of 2016 only about half of England's Clinical commissioning groups had increased local CAMHS funding.   In Scotland, between 2007 and 2016 the number of CAMHS psychologists had doubled, reflecting increased demand for the service.  131 new CAMHS beds were commissioned  by NHS England in 2018, increasing the existing 1,440 bed base by more than 10%.  56 will be in London, 12 at Bodmin Hospital and 22 at St Mary’s Hospital in Leeds.
