Circus Remedy is a circus outreach Non-Profit Organization founded in 2006 by friends Anthony Lucero, Terry Notary, and Christine Harnos.   Circus Remedy has made visits to ailing children worldwide, including children's hospitals throughout North America, The Children's Aid Society in Bronx, NY, orphanages in Tanzania and South Africa, Amma's (Mata Amritanandamayi) hospitals and orphanages in Kerala, India, Paul Newman's Hole in the Wall Gang Camp in Ashford, CT,  and IDP camps in Eastern Europe. Circus Remedy sponsors partner organizations such as the Afghan Mini Mobile Circus in Kabul, Afghanistan, and Circus Harmony's ongoing collaboration with the Jewish and Arab Galilee Youth Circus in Israel. Circus Remedy has produced two short films, Bipsy Twirlarina and the Make Believe Kid, and The Fable of Profitt the Fox, both for children's hospitals. In 2009, Circus Remedy introduced 'The Little Hands Project' to California schools, bridging healthy children to children with illness.
