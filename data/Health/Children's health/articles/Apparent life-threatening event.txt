Apparent life-threatening events (ALTE), also known as a brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE) is when a baby for less than a minute has one or more of bluish skin, poor breathing, weakness, or poor responsiveness.  By the time they are assessed in a healthcare environment they must be back to normal.  Treatment involves possibly doing an ECG and watching the child for a period of time.  Pertussis testing may also be done.  Other tests are not typically recommended.
