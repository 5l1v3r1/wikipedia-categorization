Mariana Kovacevic is a Serbian traditional healer who has specialized in the use of horse placenta treatment to heal athletes. During the duration of the 2012 African Cup of Nations in Gabon and Equatorial Guinea she used the horse placenta treatment to heal Ghana's Asamoah Gyan, who had been injured and was supposed to be off football for four weeks. She is reported to have nursed him back to health in four hours.  She was also reportedly enlisted by the Serbia during the world of 2010 in South Africa.  Other footballers who are reported to have been treated by Mariana include Pablo Zabaleta, Vincent Kompany, Nigel de Jong  and Robin Van Persie of Manchester United.  There has been some doubt as to whether Mariana's therapies work. But more footballers are turning to her for help.
