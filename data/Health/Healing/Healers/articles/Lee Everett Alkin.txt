Lee Everett or Lee Everett Alkin (born Audrey Valentine Middleton; 14 February 1937) is a British spiritual healer and businesswoman who was previously a pop singer and celebrity psychic under the stage name Lady Lee. Born in Sheffield, Audrey Middleton moved to London in 1958 after the breakdown of her first marriage. She was a backing singer for Emile Ford before Larry Parnes became her manager and gave her the stage name "Lady Lee". She also attracted media attention as the girlfriend of Billy Fury, one of Parnes's best known artists. In 1964 she got a recording contract and released three singles, none a hit: a cover of "I'm into Something Good", recorded around the same time by Herman's Hermits; "Ninety-Nine Times Out of a Hundred" by Ivor Raymonde, released in May 1965; and "My Whole World (Seems to be Tumbling Down)" by Tony Macaulay and Don Paul, released in October 1965. In 1967 she split up with Fury. In 1969 she married disc jockey Kenny Everett; they separated in 1979 and divorced in 1984. He wrote the foreword to her autobiography, published in 1987, but later criticised it for outing him; the two remained estranged until his death.  Katherine Kelly played Lee in The Best Possible Taste, a BBC drama about Kenny Everett shown in 2012 .  Lee Everett was a friend of Dusty Springfield, Elton John and Billie Jean King;  the latter two were among those she questioned about supposed past lives for a book she published in 1996. In 1980 the actor John Alkin began collaborating with Lee Everett and in 1982 they opened the "House of Spirit", a "healing centre" in Bayswater, London. They married in 1985, moved to Berkshire in 1994, and opened the "Obsidian College", another "healing centre", in 2000.  They also started the "Chilliqueen" condiments company,  which wound down when Everett turned 80 in 2017.
