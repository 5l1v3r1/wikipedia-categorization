Uzi-Eli Hezi (Hebrew: עוזי-אלי חזי‎), also known as The Etrog Man is an Israeli market vendor who also claims to be an inventor, farmer, healer, and spiritual advisor.   Uzi-Eli was born in Yemen in 1942 and was airlifted to Israel in the 1950 Operation Magic Carpet.  He is a third generation healer. While he is a student of the medicine of the Rambam, most of his recipes come to him in dreams.  He owns a booth at the Mahane Yehuda Market in the Nachlaot neighborhood of Jerusalem. He is noted for his use of Maimonidean and ancient remedies in his juices and cosmetics, particularly from the etrog.  Two of his more popular drinks include etrogat, a combination of the etrog and the gat leaf and "Rambam's drink", a mixture of dates and bitter and sweet almonds,  along with other drinks which are labeled with various alleged health benefits.
