Her father would often beat Jessica with his belt to punish her for her faults. Jessica's mother was oblivious to this abuse - in a later episode, Jessica attributed this to her mother's \"stupidness\".<sup class=\"reference plainlinks nourlexpansion\" id=\"ref_Keep_this_Party_Going\"><a href=\"#endnote_Keep_this_Party_Going\">E-14</a></sup> Jessica resented the restrictions of her life dearly and secretly developed a rebellious attitude to her father's dominance, it\u2019s also hinted that she might\u2019ve been bullied by peers which might\u2019ve further increased her frustration with the world around her. Shortly before her appearance in <i>True Blood</i>, she chooses to sneak out after her bible study to attend a friend's party. In events off-screen, she was subsequently attacked &amp; kidnapped by vampires and brought to the scene of a vampire trial, where the Magister, the enforcer of vampire justice, intended to use her as part of a sentence for a vampire on trial.<sup class=\"reference plainlinks nourlexpansion\" id=\"ref_I_Don&#39;t_Wanna_Know\"><a href=\"#endnote_I_Don&#39;t_Wanna_Know\">E-10</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Plot_synopsis\">Plot synopsis</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Jessica_Hamby&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Plot synopsis\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Season_1\">Season 1</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Jessica_Hamby&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Season 1\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>While she is still human, Jessica is brought to a vampire trial.

The Magister decides that as a punishment for his deeds, Bill is to \"create\" a new vampire, and therefore presents him with a terrified human Jessica. Bill is reluctant but willingly goes along with the sentence, draining the struggling Jessica of all her blood and burying her underground with him for one night. This process transforms Jessica into a vampire successfully, but she is under the reign of her \"maker\", Bill, to which she does not take kindly. Jessica has difficulty understanding what it means to be a vampire and initially cheers over her new-found freedom and enhanced abilities.<sup class=\"reference plainlinks nourlexpansion\" id=\"ref_I_Don&#39;t_Wanna_Know\"><a href=\"#endnote_I_Don&#39;t_Wanna_Know\">E-10</a></sup> Bill teaches her to drink synthetic blood, as opposed to human blood, but Jessica doesn't like the synthetic blood.

Jessica feigns sympathy, and convinces Sookie to take her to see Jessica's family, but Jessica enters her old home, going against what she promised to Sookie, and confronts her father when he prepares to strike her with his belt in retaliation for being away for so long. Jessica states that her family is sick and that she desires to kill her father, but Bill intervenes and saves Jessica's family from harm, later erasing their memories.<sup class=\"reference plainlinks nourlexpansion\" id=\"ref_Keep_this_Party_Going\"><a href=\"#endnote_Keep_this_Party_Going\">E-14</a></sup> After this, Jessica gradually begins to understand how to be a good vampire and starts a relationship with a human from Bill's hometown, Hoyt Fortenberry.<sup class=\"reference plainlinks nourlexpansion\" id=\"ref_Scratches\"><a href=\"#endnote_Scratches\">E-15</a></sup> At Carmilla Hotel, both admit they are still virgins and Hoyt covers the bed with rose petals before the two finally make love.

She later regrets it and glamours the last customer into giving Arlene a big tip- after Jessica successfully feeds on the woman, without harming her.\n</p><p>After Bill returns to Bon Temps, he releases her as her maker. Jessica not wanting to be alone however, declines to leave. The two reconcile and Bill trains Jessica to fight vampires and werewolves.

Over time, she learns to follow his commands and he teaches her how to \"glamour\" (very effective vampire hypnosis techniques) and how to fight. As he disappears at the beginning of <a href=\"/wiki/True_Blood_(season_3)\" title=\"True Blood (season 3)\">season 3</a>, Jessica is very frightened and lost and displays great relief upon Bill's return. Bill does start to care for Jessica as he saves her life later on.

They have a conversation at the bar, then meet up at Bill's house, where Jessica lives. Jessica is very straightforward about her sexual desires, but Hoyt is a little reluctant. Bill breaks the duo up and forbids them from seeing each other, but as he takes Jessica with him on a trip to <a href=\"/wiki/Dallas\" title=\"Dallas\">Dallas</a>, Hoyt eventually shows up at Jessica's door and they ignite their romance. Jessica comes into conflict with Hoyt's overbearing mother Maxine, who disapproves of their relationship and is prejudiced against vampires. Later on, Maxine comes under the influence of a <a href=\"/wiki/Maenad\" title=\"Maenad\">maenad</a> and loses her limitations, after which she starts dishing out her true opinion on Jessica. Jessica attacks her, so Hoyt breaks up with her.  In Season 3 he attempts to get back together with her but she refuses, as she is afraid of her vampire nature.  However, after she saves Hoyt from an attack by a <a href=\"/wiki/Shapeshifter\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Shapeshifter\">shapeshifter</a>, they reconcile.

Hoyt and Jessica both have different needs and Jessica cheats on Hoyt twice (first with a random fangbanger, then by kissing Jason after he saved her life). Jessica contemplates leaving Hoyt, but when she does, he reacts angrily and cruelly reminds her of her shortcomings (such as her inability to have children) before kicking her out. She tries to seek Jason's help, but he rejects her also as he chooses his best friend's - Hoyt's - side.  Jason eventually gives in to his feelings for Jessica, which earns the enmity of both Hoyt and Jason's former friends.  Struggling with the pain of the breakup, Hoyt eventually asks Jessica to \"glamour\" or hypnotize away all his memories of her and Jason before he moves to Alaska.  Hoyt returns in season 7, with his new girlfriend, Brigette.  He meets Jessica again after saving her life from a sadistic vampire named Violet.  She eventually falls for him again and tells him their story, accepting responsibility for the failure of their first relationship.  Hoyt again has feelings for her, despite having only just \"met\" her.

After Jason escapes from Hotshot, Jessica and Hoyt find him. Jessica gives Jason her blood to heal him, which causes him to develop romantic and sexual feelings for her. She comes to his rescue as he is in the woods with full moon and later on, he saves her as she is about to meet the sun under a witch' curse.
