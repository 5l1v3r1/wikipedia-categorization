These include <a href=\"/wiki/Isabel_Evans\" title=\"Isabel Evans\">Isabel Evans</a> (Vilandra, Zan's sister), <a href=\"/wiki/Michael_Guerin\" title=\"Michael Guerin\">Michael Guerin</a> (Rath, Vilandra's betrothed husband and Zan's second-in command), and <a href=\"/wiki/Tess_Harding\" title=\"Tess Harding\">Tess Harding</a> (Ava, Zan's bride).

In the series, the <a href=\"/wiki/U.S._Army\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"U.S. Army\">U.S. Army</a> finds the alien pods and takes them to a base for study. The four are saved by an <a href=\"/wiki/United_States_Air_Force\" title=\"United States Air Force\">Air Force</a> pilot and stashed in a new ship hidden in a rock formation.

Being a <a href=\"/wiki/Hybridism\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hybridism\">hybrid</a> often forces him to hide his true self. Because he must conceal his true identity, Max is a complex character, very timid at times, yet passionate and carefree at others. Even before he knew that he was the clone of the king of Antar, Max emerged as the <a href=\"/wiki/De_facto\" title=\"De facto\">de facto</a> leader among his friends.\n</p><p>Portrayed as the deep thinker of the group, Max sometimes is nevertheless shown spurred to bold action by his protective nature. This sometimes manifests as a character flaw, as his protective nature leads him to make conservative choices. However, fitting into the <a href=\"/wiki/Archetypal\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Archetypal\">archetypal</a> leader role, he always takes responsibility for his actions and choices, and is never beyond offering apologies to those he hurts. Max also stands out in the group because of his unique healing powers.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Pilot_2-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Pilot-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Powers_and_abilities\">Powers and abilities</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Max_Evans_(Roswell)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Powers and abilities\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Max is capable of molecular manipulation and telekinesis, just like the rest of the hybrids,<sup id=\"cite_ref-Pilot_2-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Pilot-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> although he is not as well-practiced with either of these abilities as the others.

However, this power is not used again in the show, and the character does not acknowledge this ability nor does the viewer understand if it is a different power or a variation of his other existing powers. It appears that when he heals certain people - or at least the people he's emotionally close to - they start to develop alien powers, as he healed <a href=\"/wiki/Liz_Parker\" title=\"Liz Parker\">Liz Parker</a> and she later developed powers; it is also hinted that <a href=\"/wiki/Kyle_Valenti\" title=\"Kyle Valenti\">Kyle Valenti</a> will develop them. It is possible that his healing ability sets off some sort of genetic chain reaction that enables those he's healed to access more of their brains' evolutionary potential \u2013 it was established that the \"alien\" powers he and the others possess are in fact abilities inherent in the human brain.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Relationship_with_Liz_Parker\">Relationship with Liz Parker</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Max_Evans_(Roswell)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Relationship with Liz Parker\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>An important premise of Max's character (and the show itself) is that he's been in love with <a href=\"/wiki/Liz_Parker\" title=\"Liz Parker\">Liz Parker</a> since the first time he saw her at school when he was just six years old (shortly after emerging from the pod). He keeps himself distanced from Liz, primarily because of his concerns about being an alien and her being a human.\nThis secret ends in the pilot episode when she gets shot at the Crashdown Cafe and he saves her life, risking everything for her and starting the lead plot of the show.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Pilot_2-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Pilot-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Max intensely loves Liz, sometimes he cares about her even more than he cares about his fellow alien-human hybrids or even himself.

Liz then witnesses an argument between two customers and is accidentally shot. Max rushes to her side and heals the wound simply by placing his hand over it, bringing her back to life. Liz later discovers a silver hand print on her stomach, a mystery she becomes determined to solve. During a biology class experiment, Liz sneaks a sample of Max's saliva and examines it under a microscope, discovering that Max's cells look nothing like human cells. She confronts Max, who then admits that he, his sister Isabel and their friend Michael are aliens whose spaceship crashed at Roswell in 1947. By telling her, Max breaks the ultimate taboo that he, Isabel, and Michael have kept their whole lives. Liz becomes the first human to know the secret of the \"Pod Squad\". Overwhelmed by the secret, she asks Max why he'd risked everything to heal her. Max replies, \"Because it was you.\" This sets the tone for the series: Max will break any rule (including his own) for Liz.\n</p><p>In order to gain her trust, Max creates a connection with her so she can see into his soul.

In the effort, Max is abducted by a special branch of the <a href=\"/wiki/FBI\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"FBI\">FBI</a> headed by the elusive Special Agent Pierce. Max is tortured for information but rescued by Nasedo and Michael before he reveals anything significant. In turn, they manage to kidnap Pierce. In the subsequent confusion, gunfire erupts and the sheriff inadvertently shoots his son, Kyle. Michael kills Pierce while Max saves Kyle using the same method that he had used on Liz at the start of the season. Thankful, Sheriff Valenti gives Max his word that he will protect him, Isabel and Michael.\n</p><p>It is the ship hidden in the caves that eventually is the key to the hybrids' history. An image of Max and Isabel's mother comes up and tells them that they are the clones of the Royal Four of their home world Antar. Tess and Max were married, Isabel was his sister and a promised spouse of Michael, who was Max's second in command. Upon hearing this Liz runs away as she realizes that his destiny and responsibility are far bigger than her.

The others now awkwardly defer to him, except for Michael who still acts out and does things his own way. At the beginning of season two, Max's relationship with Liz is awkward. He still loves her and declares to her that he will keep fighting for her and will never give up on them.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Ask_Not_10-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Ask_Not-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> His role as the leader also proves to be an obstacle as he finds out about power he never knew he had and the responsibility that comes with that power.

They target Liz's new boss, Congresswoman Whitaker, who had a relationship with Special Agent Pierce, and do some reconnaissance on her. It is later revealed that the Congresswoman was in fact a Skin.\n</p><p>It is around this time that Max tries to resurrect his relationship with Liz, but she rejects his advances. He only gives up on her when he catches Liz in bed with Kyle Valenti, believing that they had been together. The truth is that it's all a setup created by Liz when the future version of Max comes back from the future saying that she had to make his present self stop loving her because their love will be the cause of the end of the world. Future Max and Future Liz sacrificed their love in order to make Tess stay in Roswell (in their timeline, she left after Max and Liz cemented their relationship), because she is obsessed with Max and would stay only if Max gives her a chance.<sup id=\"cite_ref-The_End_of_the_World_22-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-The_End_of_the_World-22\">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>However, for most of season two, Max and Tess are only friends.

Things change, however when their friend Alex dies and his friendship with Liz is compromised by her research for Alex's alien killer that Max cannot accept. He then has his first personal crisis about who he really is and loses his balance. When Tess starts helping him to remember his past, Max is confused about himself.

A truth that his life is not real and Tess is correct. When he realizes that he has really lost everything, especially Liz, he sleeps with Tess. She is the only one with him and seems to know answers that he is unable to find. Though the two of them are essentially strangers to each other, he does, however try and feel something for her, in line with his destiny.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Too_Late_23-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Too_Late-23\">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup> The day after their night together, he realizes his mistake and is unable to love her no matter whether his previous self (Zan) had feelings for her or not.

The purpose was to finally destroy the royal family. Max, now angry, wants to kill her but stops, realizing that she is still carrying his son. He lets her go to Antar to save the baby he still believes would not survive on Earth.\n</p><p>He regroups with Liz and the others on the mountainside.

The ship is located underneath a convenience store in Utah. Having rekindled his relationship with Liz, the two of them devise a robbery, Liz holding up the store with a gun, while Max goes underneath the store to locate the ship. When there, he runs out of time trying to figure out how to work it, before they are captured by the police. Although the charges against Max and Liz are dismissed due to deft legal work by his father, the latter demands to know his reasons for robbing the store, and Max, not wanting to get his father mixed up in the alien affairs, leaves the house to stay with Michael. Subsequently, Liz's parents forbid her to see Max again, and the two of them are forced to carry on their relationship in secret.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Busted_26-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Busted-26\">&#91;26&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Max continues the search for his son.

When Max realizes this, Langley threatens his life again, attempting to force him to return home to Roswell.\n</p><p>Langley's reasons are rooted in his desire to be human, even though he lacks human DNA and cannot even feel or be hurt by fire. Therefore, he fears Max, who can make him alien again, but cannot kill him because he was made to protect him. After discovering that his protector is genetically programmed to obey his direct orders, Max forces Langley to help him find the ship again and use it in order to leave Earth. Langley advises that the ship is too damaged to work. Ultimately, when the ship is finally located, it doesn't work and does not leave the hangar. After the accident, Max takes Langley to his home to help him because he feels guilty for what had happened. Langley tells him that even though he is genetically Max's protector, he will always hate him.\n</p><p>After Max's apologies, Langley finally understands that the boy is just desperate and wants to save his baby, but doesn't know what to do. He then tells Max about things that would have been lost if the ship had really worked. Max finally understands and devastatingly realizes that he almost lost everything, especially Liz, whom he had promised to come back to as soon as he could. Kal's first and last advice to Max is <i>\"The more you embrace our alien side...

Max starts to believe that maybe his son is using Samuel for the purpose of contacting him. Max then visits Samuel, in an effort to befriend him and using what happened to help Samuel as well. However, Max soon realizes that Samuel is not his son and the reason why he talked with him and \"liked\" him at first sight is attributed to qualities Max possesses, including being special and \"different\", just like Samuel. He thought that maybe Max could assist him to communicate with his parents and tell them he loved them, even if he could not tell it like other children. Later, Max, with Isabel's help create a shared dream with Samuel and his parents, giving Samuel what he wanted. The encounter with Samuel makes Max realize that Liz is his family and even if he really finds his son, nothing will not change. He then tells her at the end of the episode when they go at the ice skating together, fulfilling his promise to Liz at the beginning.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Samuel_30-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Samuel-30\">&#91;30&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Later in the season, Liz begins developing alien powers of her own, evidently as a side effect of Max healing her over two years ago. She's sick and it seems that she could die. Max tries to find a solution and he's willing to contact even the FBI if it's necessary, but nothing seems to help her and it gets worse. When trying to heal her with the healing stones she explodes crying, telling him that he always hurts her like when he slept with Tess. Max realizes that even if she's stressed by what is happening to her, she really feels this way. When he tries to talk with her about it Liz decides to take a break from Roswell in order to understand who she is and what she wants. Max tells her that he loves her trying to make her understand that he will be there when she wants and he isn't angry with her for what she said.

Later Michael finds that someone at Meta-Chem is tracking him and most likely they discovered that he's an alien and they killed Monk for this reason. With Valenti's help, Michael tries to discover the truth but someone kidnaps Valenti. Max, Michael and Isabel go to Meta-Chem in order to free him. Max is the one who finds him and he discovers that someone at Meta-Chem, led by their leader Meris, was tracking Michael because they thought that he was the healer alien.\n</p><p>Meris wants Max to heal her elderly husband. When Max tries to explain to her that he can't heal people who're dying for natural reasons, Meris blackmails him using Valenti's life, and Max is forced to try the heal. However, something goes wrong in the healing process and instead of healing Meris' husband Max gives his life to the old man. Max becomes the old one, and when the healing process ends a circle of fire emits from Max's body. The fire comes back to him and the room catches on fire.

At first, he is happy of the change for the better, but while he's kissing his wife he's hit by strong flashes of Max and Liz together from Max's soul, and he rolls over, agonized. At this point, he realizes that Max is still inside him, and he believes that the only way he can get rid of Max is to kill Liz. Clayton goes to Vermont, but when he sees her he realizes that Max's connection to the girl is stronger than he thought.\n</p><p>Later, when Clayton tries to kill Liz, Max takes control over his body in order to tell Liz to kill him. Liz doesn't want to hurt or kill Max, but he yells at her saying that she must do it otherwise Clayton will kill her so she must kill them both in order to save herself. However, Clayton takes the control again and while he's trying to kill Liz they both fall from the window to the ground of the school. While they're falling Max takes control over Clayton again and both him and Liz get flashes of their life and all the people they love. All Max sees are his memories with Liz and how she's his whole life so he sacrifices his life in order to save hers. He reaches out to project an energy field to break her fall without using one for himself. Then, even as Liz is cushioned in the protective green energy, Max falls to the ground without a protection. After a moment, the energy field blinks out and Liz drops down, falling closer to Max, both of them lying still. Later, Liz wakes up and, touching Max, realizes he is dead.\n</p><p>She tenderly caresses his face with her hands and bends over him in order to give him her last kiss. A single tear falls onto his cheek and a glow of white energy passes across his face. It begins to transform, taking on Clayton's original features, then fading back into Max's until he wakes up staring into her tearful eyes. Max tells her that she brought him back from death.

Michael can't handle this change and he starts to act recklessly. He becomes dangerous and the group tries to find a solution. Eventually, Max takes the seal from him and returns to be the rightful king again even if he never liked this role.

Tess' arrival, however, has sparked government action because in order to protect her son she killed a whole military base. So, in the end of the episode, to ward them away from her son, she sacrifices herself, blowing up the military base and dying in the process and she asks Liz for help.

Not able to harm the Special Unit again, the group agrees to flee Roswell separately. Max gives up his throne because they're a group and their lives are in danger, he can't make all the decisions anymore and after all, he never really considered himself as the king nor the leader and they all have the right to choose what they want to do with their life.\n</p><p>Later, Max proposes to Liz and she accepts because they can't leave Roswell without each other, even if it means they'll be killed. However, at the high school graduation ceremony Max tries to sacrifice himself by taking FBI attention only on him in order to free the others but Michael saves him at last minute. After what happened, the group makes the decision to leave Roswell all together, instead of separately like they established before.

I think he learned over the course of this year that he can't always take positions and always tell people what the right or wrong thing to do is. He has learned not to be as controlling as he was before, and allow people to make mistakes on their own and learn from them. The only problem with that is he's still kind of struggling with that attitude, because some of the mistakes other people might make could have serious consequences for everyone. Michael, for instance, wants so badly to find a way home, but to the other characters Roswell is home. He'll do whatever it takes and whatever it costs to do this. It's very hard for Max to get through to him and make Michael understand what he's doing could be dangerous for everyone involved.
