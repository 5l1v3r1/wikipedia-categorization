Zuma is a Filipino comic book character created by Jim Fernandez in 1976. The series ran in syndication until 1985.  Zuma's body has a snake part/protrusion on both his shoulders. As told in the comics, Zuma is a demigod and the son of the Aztec serpent god Kukulkan ("Plumed Serpent", "Feathered Serpent"). He had been entombed in a buried Aztec pyramid until unearthed by an archaeological expedition team. Unleashed into the modern world, Zuma goes on a murderous rampage, preying particularly on virgin women who he rips and eats the hearts of. Zuma first appeared in the comics series Aztec. The character reached the peak of his popularity in the 1980s with the series Anak ni Zuma (Offspring of Zuma) in Aliwan Komiks magazine. It spawned a spin-off prequel Angkan ni Zuma (Clan of Zuma), chronicling Zuma's adventures in ancient times. Zuma-Maria was a science-fiction tale about Zuma's future descendant. In the mid-1990s, Zuma was revived in a short-lived comic book series, Zuma Komiks (Zuma Comics). There have only been two Philippine Zuma movies to date, Zuma (1985) and Anak ni Zuma (1988),  both starring actor Max Laurel in the title role. Snooky Serna played Galema, Zuma's daughter, only in the first film; the role was played in the sequel by a lesser-known actress named Jenny Lyn. Max Laurel appeared in other films only as a character actor. Zuma also appeared in the 2013 series Galema: Anak ni Zuma.
