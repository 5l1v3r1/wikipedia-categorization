Since 1995, the illustration work of Nagraj has been taken over by artist and writer <a href=\"/wiki/Anupam_Sinha\" title=\"Anupam Sinha\">Anupam Sinha</a>.\n</p><p>The name Nagraj is derived from the word \"<a href=\"/wiki/Nagaraja\" title=\"Nagaraja\">Nagaraja</a>\"(<a href=\"/wiki/Hindi\" title=\"Hindi\">Hindi</a>:\u0928\u093e\u0917\u0930\u093e\u091c\u093e ) which is itself made up of two words \"<a href=\"/wiki/N%C4%81ga\" title=\"N\u0101ga\">n\u0101ga</a>\" (<a href=\"/wiki/Hindi\" title=\"Hindi\">Hindi</a>:\u0928\u093e\u0917) and \"<a href=\"/wiki/Raja\" title=\"Raja\">raja</a>\" (<a href=\"/wiki/Hindi\" title=\"Hindi\">Hindi</a>:\u0930\u093e\u091c\u093e) where the word \"n\u0101ga\" means snake and \"raja\" means king. Nagraj is believed to have been inspired by the mythological <i><a href=\"/wiki/Ichchhadhari_Nag\" title=\"Ichchhadhari Nag\">Ichchhadhari Nag</a></i> (shape shifting snakes) and historical <i><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Vishmanushya&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Vishmanushya (page does not exist)\">Vishmanushya</a></i> (venomous human). His stories create a rich blend of mythology, fantasy, magic, and science fiction. Many of Nagraj's fans believe that, over time, Nagraj's comics have developed a snake mythology of its own, which is unique to the popular Indian beliefs about snakes that are prevalent among the masses.\n</p><p>Nagraj was originally conceived as an enemy of international terrorism. In his debut issue, Nagraj was unleashed as an international terror weapon by the evil scientist Professor Nagmani. Nagraj, in this first mission, was tasked with stealing a golden statue of a Goddess from a temple that was protected by tribal devotees, snakes, and by a mysterious 300-year-old <a href=\"/wiki/Sadhu\" title=\"Sadhu\">Sadhu</a> named Baba Gorakhnath. Nagraj succeeded in his task, but upon confrontation with Gorakhnath and his mystic black <a href=\"/wiki/Mongoose\" title=\"Mongoose\">mongoose</a> shikangi, was defeated. Gorakhnath read his mind and discovered that Professor Nagmani had implanted a mind control device in the form of a capsule in Nagraj's head, to keep him under his control. Gorakhnath operated and removed the capsule from Nagraj's head, setting Nagraj free of Professor Nagmani's control. Nagraj then became Baba Goraknath's disciple and vowed to eliminate crime and terror from the Earth. Since then, Nagraj has thrice toured the world and defeated many villains and terrorists.\n</p><p>Nagraj lives as Raj (After Nagraj Ke Baad, he is under disguise of Nagraj Shah) in a fictional Metropolitan City Mahanagar as an employee of a TV channel that he owns secretly.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Fictional_character_biography\">Fictional character biography</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Nagraj&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Fictional character biography\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In ancient times, there existed a kingdom known as Takshaknagar, ruled by King Takshakraj and Queen Lalita. The couple had no worries except for one fact that, they had no children. The absence of a prince or princess made Nagpasha the only potential heir to the throne. Nagpasha was the younger brother of the King Takshakraj. Knowing that he was the only potential heir to the throne, Nagpasha started living a lavish worry-free life.\n</p><p>As time passed, Queen Lalita started getting depressed for not having a child of her own. The king realised the cause of her depression and became upset as well. The couple used to pray to their family deity <a href=\"/wiki/Deva_(Hinduism)\" title=\"Deva (Hinduism)\">Dev</a> Kaljayi for his blessings. Dev Kaljayi also knew of their grievances, so one day he blessed them to have a great child. His blessings came true as the queen soon became pregnant and the whole kingdom rejoiced, except for Nagpasha. The birth of this child meant the loss of the throne for him, so he decided to kill the child before he was born.\n</p><p>One day when the queen was going to pray to Deva Kaljayi, Nagpasha replaced the curtained plate of her offerings to the god with one containing a dead mongoose. The Snake God got angry and knocked her unconscious with his venomous breath. The king sought forgiveness from the <a href=\"/wiki/Devata\" title=\"Devata\">Devta</a> and pleaded with him to cure his wife, to which the Devta refused. Then the desperate king tried to commit suicide. Not able to withstand a devotee's death, Deva Kaljayi showed him a way to save the queen's life. He gave a crystal to the king and told him to treat it with the queen's medicine. The crystal would divert all the poison from the queen's body to the child's body. However, due to the ill effects of the poison. the queen would lose her fertility.\n</p><p>The kingdom was highly grieved, as was the king. Nagpasha was overjoyed that he was now the sole heir to the throne. When the child was born, everyone believed him dead because his whole body was blue and showed no signs of life. As per Hindu rituals, the newborn baby was thrown into the river.\n</p><p>Nagpasha rejoiced and went to Deva Kaljayi; the deity that also protected the grand royal treasure in form of a giant two-headed snake, and asked him to hand over the royal treasures, telling him that now he was the sole heir to the throne, so the treasure rightfully belonged to him. Deva Kaljayi refused and told him that the \"real successor\" to the throne was alive and when the time comes the treasure will be handed over to him. Enraged, Nagpasha raised his sword against the deity only to be thrown away by a mere flick of the giant snake's tail. Nagpasha fell upon two bowls, one containing the highly toxic venom (halahal,the greatest form of venom as believed by Hindus) which destroyed his face and mixed with his blood, and the other containing Amrit, which made him immortal. Simultaneous effects of both made Nagpasha an immortal, venomous man. At that time, Nagpasha could not tolerate the changes in his body and fainted.\n</p><p>When the king was informed of the happenings by Dev Kaljayi, he realised that his son was not dead and he also realised the potential dangers to his son's life. So he ordered his faithful <a href=\"/wiki/Astrologer\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Astrologer\">astrologer</a> Vedacharya, who had great knowledge of <a href=\"/wiki/Amulet\" title=\"Amulet\">Tilism</a> to enclose the treasure in a Tilism which could be broken only by his son. Vedacharya made the tilism with the co-operation of Dev Kaljayi to ensure that no one, except for the king's son, will be able to break the tilism, not even immortal Nagpasha. When Nagpasha came to his senses, he realised that he had lost the treasure. Enraged, he murdered the king and the queen.\n</p><p>The child, floating away on the river in his state of <a href=\"/wiki/Suspended_animation\" title=\"Suspended animation\">suspended animation</a>, got stuck somewhere in bushes. He laid there for a long time.\n</p><p>Meanwhile, the snake <a href=\"/wiki/Deity\" title=\"Deity\">deity</a> Deva Kaljayi appeared in the dreams of King Maniraj and his wife Queen Manika, rulers of ageless <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Ichchhadhaari_naags&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Ichchhadhaari naags (page does not exist)\">Ichchhadhaari naags</a>, living secretly on an invisible island in the Indian Ocean called Nagdweep. He told them the location of the baby and asked them to cure him. They did so and discovered that the baby was far more venomous than the greatest snake on Nagdweep, which was Mahatma Kaaldoot, indicating that he had <a href=\"/wiki/Divinity\" title=\"Divinity\">divine</a> venom of the god. Initially, the raj vaid was unsure whether he would be able to cure the child, but since Dev Kaljayi himself asked the king for his treatment, he was assured that the treatment will work. According to the rules, no one was permitted to bring an outsider to the island, so the king decided to keep his presence a secret.\n</p><p>Many years passed and the treatment started showing results and, although still in the suspended animation, the color of the baby had gradually changed to green. The king gave the news to the queen and they decided to adopt the child, since they had no child of their own. Their decision was heard by Vishandhar, an evil <a href=\"/wiki/Tantra\" title=\"Tantra\">Tantrik</a> who wanted to become the ruler of the island, but was afraid of Mahatma Kaaldoot. He attacked the secret area where the baby was kept and escaped with him, but fearing the wrath of the god, he decided not to kill the baby and instead placed him back into the same bushes in the river where he was found. His plan failed as the queen soon got pregnant and gave birth to a daughter who was named Visarpi.\n</p><p>Vishandhar never knew that the baby that he left astray was cured enough to regain his senses. First, his face and later, his whole body, turned normal color and he started crying. A priest of the nearby temple located him and gave him to Professor Nagmani, who was wandering in the nearby forest searching for snakes. For unknown reasons, the priest narrated a fake story that the child belonged to a woman, who was a devotee of the Snake God. He also said that the child was blessed by an ichchhadhari naag, so he asked Nagmani to bring up the child and allows him to avenge his mother.\n</p><p>Nagmani realised that the priest was lying, but he took the child. The blood tests of the child showed that the child had minute, microscopic snakes in his blood, filling in for <a href=\"/wiki/White_blood_cell\" title=\"White blood cell\">white blood cells</a>. The child had extraordinary healing powers and was extremely venomous. He raised the baby, who became Nagraj.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Plot_summary\">Plot summary</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Nagraj&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Plot summary\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Nagraj was presented to the world as a creation of Professor Nagmani. He was meant to be an ultimate killing machine, and his original plan was to hire out Nagraj to the highest bidder among villains and terrorist groups of the world.\n</p><p>Professor Nagmani used him for his other experimental projects and leased him for international terrorism. Nagmani always claimed that Nagraj's powers were evolved by feeding him bits of snake poison until his blood itself became poison. He claimed that his <a href=\"/wiki/Venom\" title=\"Venom\">venom</a> was a result of snake bites from 1,000 different species of snakes (This echoes the Indian legends of poison-men or women, specifically raised to kill by their kiss) and his other powers evolved when he was treated with ashes of a dead ichchhadhaari snake. In reality, Nagraj was much more poisonous than any species of snakes because his venom was celestial.\n</p><p>Based largely on the Hindu myth of the shape shifting snake, Nagraj derives most of his powers from microscopic snakes that live in his bloodstream, in lieu of white blood cells. He has a number of powers, such as superhuman strength, poisonous breath and poison-bite, instant healing powers, and snakes that come out of his wrists. The snakes can come out individually or form into ropes, parachutes, and many others, depending on his imagination. His venom is believed to be far stronger than Potassium Cyanide, resulting in the melting of any living being's body if he bites them or vice versa.\n</p><p>For his first mission, he was sold for a sum of $1&#160;million and was to recover an ancient statue. Nagraj succeeds, but then is foiled by the Sage Baba Gorakhnath, who frees him from the mind control of Professor Nagamani. Waking up to a newer world amid the calmness of Gorakhnath, Nagraj takes a vow to eliminate terrorism from the world and works toward achieving this goal.\n</p><p>In his initial issues, Nagraj's powers were too limited, and at times he was even knocked out by powerful human opponents. His strength was also quite human in nature, as he would marvel at his opponent's strength, such as when someone picked up a car. Over the years, Nagraj became powerful enough to not only pick up falling cars single-handedly, but also to achieve feats such as throwing things into outer space effortlessly. This happened in the issue <i>Nagadhish</i>, when he threw the controlling sceptre of a serpent court official into orbit.\n</p><p>It is notable, and perhaps ironic, that Nagraj has now been transformed into a mythical/magical creature facing fantastical creatures as his enemies, with elements of sorcery/magic and even time and space travel.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Powers_and_abilities\">Powers and abilities</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Nagraj&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Powers and abilities\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Nagraj, a character in the <a href=\"/wiki/Raj_Comics\" title=\"Raj Comics\">Raj Comics</a> series,<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> has a huge arsenal of powers of which most can be credited to his divine birth in the comics storyline. Ever since Writer &amp; Artist Anupam Sinha took over the character of Nagraj, his powers and abilities have evolved a great deal making him powerful enough to counter any character of the comic universe.\nNagraj is arguably the most powerful superhero in the Raj Comics Universe and is among the most powerful <a href=\"/wiki/Ichchhadhari_Nag\" title=\"Ichchhadhari Nag\">Icchadhari Naagas</a> of his time.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources.

He can \"release\" snakes out of his body at his will through his hands and use them for whatsoever purpose he likes, controlling them through telepathy. Though Nagraj gives full liberty to his snakes, his will can keep them inside his body, leading him at times to take enemy snakes inside him.\nSnakes in his body can be classified into many groups:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Microscopic snakes</li></ul>\n<p>Though these are snakes, of many different species, which commonly exist in the real world, being born in Nagraj's body\nmeans that they share in Nagraj's extremely powerful venom. Nagraj uses them variably as ropes, ladders, parachutes, shields, boats, spies and messengers. Most notable among them is Naganand, at a time considered right-hand man of Nagraj, he left Nagraj's body to look after the people of Nagdweep at Nagraj's order after he upgraded to become an ichchhadhaari nag.\nNagraj has accumulated snakes which weren\u2019t born in Nagraj's body, but it was Nagraj who gave them a place in his body. These snakes are usually snakes carrying some special abilities. They include\n</p>\n<ul><li>Jagmag sarp(glowing snakes which in Nagayana series were shown shooting lasers),</li>\n<li>Naav-sarp(giant snakes, Nagraj uses them for making snake-boats),</li>\n<li>Nagfani sarp(literally \"cactus-snakes\") and</li>\n<li>Ichchhadhaari-naags (shape-shifting snakes).</li>\n<li>Nagfani-sarp Given by Deva Kaljayi to Nagraj, these snakes have spikes on their body and they can easily rip apart most opponents. The extent of their power is still a mystery; powers tend to be revealed when necessary for the plotline. For instance, Nagraj once used a snake to tie up an enemy, revealing that they may extend themselves at length.</li></ul>\n<dl><dd>Nagfani snakes may have additional powers:</dd></dl>\n<ul><li>Dhwansak sarp&#160;: short-living magical snakes which explode at will causing major damage to their surroundings. Though Nagfani-sarp warned Nagraj about using them too frequently, Nagraj never ever had any problems with their numbers while using them.</li>\n<li>Tishk sarp&#160;: This snake wraps himself around Nagraj's forehead giving him paranatural powers and the ability to break physical laws. Using these snakes Nagraj can see and fight against souls and invisible powers. While using this power</li></ul>\n<p>Nagraj's body gets divided into minute particles making him almost ethereal and immune to physical damage, also\ntemporarily disabling his power to eject snakes out of his body. This form of Nagraj is called Maanas Nagraj.\nIchchhadhaari nags.\nThey may or may not be of the same species but all snakes possessing the power of shape-shifting come under this\ncategory. They include a big bunch of ichchhadhaari naags banished from Nagdweep. It is quite notable that some of\nthem possess such great powers which rival Nagraj's own, but they all hold great respect for Nagraj. While some of them\nlive in his body just cause they have no better place to live, others live willingly to learn something from Nagraj's way of\nlife. Most notable names among them are&#160;:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Saudaangi&#160;: Saudaangi is the most famous and most notable Ichchhadhari nag inside Nagraj's body. Also she was the very first special snake induced by Nagraj in his body. She is the member of an Egyptian clan of snakes which fights against the evil mummy of pharaoh Tutankhemun. Like Nagfani snakes she too has spikes on her body when she is in her snake form,she also has a limited knowledge of Tantra. Among the trio of Sheetnag kumar, Naagu and her, her powers are least explained. In early issues of Nagraj, she often became the decisive force of the fights between Nagraj and his powerful enemies, particularly Nagdant. Though she does not appear as frequently as earlier, she still has a devoted fan following with some urging that she should be the main love interest of Nagraj.</li>\n<li>Sheetnag kumar&#160;: Sheetnag-kumar is now the most frequently appearing ichchhadhari sarp of Nagraj's body. Earlier a rival Sheetnag-kumar has now become one of Nagraj's most trusted snakes. He belongs to a clan of ichchhadhari nags living on the Himayalas. Sheetnag-kumar is known for his \"icy powers\", he can create and manipulate ice at his will giving it different forms like spears and arrows. Sheetnag-kumar also regulates Nagraj's body temperature making him immune to normal fire when he is inside his body and also giving him protection against severe cold&#160;; one of Nagraj's greatest weakness which makes him drowzy pushing him towards hibernation . Sheetnag-kumar's Fang can absorb many attacks and revert them back towards the enemy. He can also freeze all the liquids inside one's body paralysing him.</li>\n<li>Naagu&#160;: Naagu is the most cheerful and comical among Nagraj's snakes. His acts are such that at times it becomes difficult to judge whether he is a jester or a helper. He belongs to a family of Ichchhadhaari naags living near Mahanagar.</li></ul>\n<p>His main source of power is his mani which grants him almost every imaginable power. For entering Nagraj's body he\nhas to remove his mani from his possession so he hides it in micro form at some place in Nagraj's dress. He though\nlooks and behaves like an idiot and talks non-sense, but he is the one who can never be underestimated. Unlike other snakes in Nagraj's body, Naagu decided to live in Nagraj's body for no reason other than watching movies, which becomes easier living in\ncity. He is a true movie lover and remembers all dialogues of his favourite movies be it Bollywood or Hollywood.\n</p>\n<ul><li>Sukshm-sarp: This is not a type but a state of the snakes living in Nagraj's body. Nagraj's snakes live in his body in form of Sukshm-sarps, or \"micro-snakes\". In this state the snakes of Nagraj's body can do anything which they could while in their maximized state, and just their size is affected. They carry out many important activities inside and even outside Nagraj's body. While in Nagraj's body they performs functions like healing his body, fighting against diseases and providing him superhuman strength. They have also been used to cure others of their diseases.</li>\n<li>Nagraj once used one of his powerful snakes Nagshri in Nagdant's body to kill all the micro-snakes inside him making him powerless temporarily.</li>\n<li>He also used them to temporary disable Karanvashi's hypnotic powers.</li>\n<li>Nagraj sent one of his sukhsham-sarp to live inside shakti's body to contact her in case of an emergency.</li>\n<li>Nagraj used one of his dhwansak-sarp in sukhsham roop (micro form) to destroy the brain of a terrorist recently in WTSSeries.</li></ul>\n<p>Nagraj's Venom<br />\nNagraj's venom is the most powerful venom of the world, so much so that direct contact with it results in instant death\nand melting of body. He gained his venom through the blessings of snake deity Deva Kaaljayi, who himself was blessed\nby Lord Shiva. It is explained that Lord Shiva who holds the strongest venom of the universe synthesised during\nSamudra-Manthan, gave a minor portion of it to Deva Kaljayi who holds a dilute form of it and Nagraj holds an even more\ndilute form of it. The different ways in which Nagraj uses his venom also results in various powers he is said to possess.\nLike&#160;:\nVish-funkar\nNagraj uses his breath to force out his venom in vapour form, depending upon its concentration the\nvish-funkar can cause a variety of damages to his enemies. Its effects include temporary blindness, drowzyness, black\nouts, deaths and for once it even caused fire. This power of Nagraj once as a side-effect temporarily cured Richa (love\ninterest of Super Commando Dhruva) of her disease pertaining respiratory system. This is among one of the oldest\ndisplayed powers of Nagraj.\n</p><p><br />Vish-dansh\n</p>\n<dl><dd>This is simply a snake-bite. Since Nagraj has divine venom more often than not this power when executed properly</dd></dl>\n<p>results in an opponent's instant death,[1] though exceptional beings able to withstand the poison\ninclude the Deva Kaljayi, himself and enemies who didn't have a biological body. It was suggested in one issue\nthat the venom inside Nagraj's teeth is far more vicious than the venom in his blood, perhaps so much so that\nNagraj might die if he bites himself.\n</p><p><br />Vish-fuhaar\n</p>\n<dl><dd>Nagraj can spill out high amount of liquid venom from his mouth. Since liquid form is much more concentrated in</dd></dl>\n<p>comparison to vapour form therefore it causes more damage in comparison to vish-funkar, it is said that use of this power\nhas negative effects on Nagraj weakening him temporarily cause it results in sudden drop of venom inside his body\ndecreasing the number of sukhsham-sarps too.\n</p><p><br />Vish-varsha\n</p>\n<dl><dd>This is one of the lesser known applications of Nagraj's venom. Nagraj once under the influence of evil powers spilled his venom as vish-fuhaar over the ocean and heated it using his dhwansak-sarp forming venomous clouds, the clouds</dd></dl>\n<p>rained a very dilute form of his venom which was still extremely powerful. Whosoever came in contact with it died\ninstantly and their bodies melted. After the clouds cleared there were many human skeletons lying at various places as a\nproof of the viciousness of Nagraj's venom.\n</p><p><br /><b>Ichchhadhaari Shakti and its origin</b>\n</p>\n<dl><dd>According to the comic storyline inspired from a popular puranic storyline which has many alternate versions,</dd></dl>\n<p>Vishwamitra a king who turned into a Rishi and wished to become a Brahmarshi (which he later became) once promised\nhis disciple Trishanku to send him to heaven alive with his body. This alarmed the Gods who to protect the rules of the\nuniverse decided not to let this happen. When Rishi Vishwamitra applied his power to send him towards heaven, the\nGods applied counter-force to oppose him. This resulted in a stalemate. Despite all his efforts Vishwamitra failed to fulfil\nhis promise. This enraged Vishwamitra, he saw this act of the Gods as his insult, so he used his power to call upon the\npower which was used for the creation of the Universe. He started creating a new heaven for sending Trishanku there to\nkeep his words. Seeing the powers of the rishi and alarmed by his act the gods themselves descended upon earth and\nconvinced him to drop his decision. Vishwamitra after realizing that Trishanku had evil intentions left him hanging. (It is\nbelieved that he is still hanging somewhere between heaven and earth alive cause Vishwamitra gave him half of his\npowers).\nVishwamitra called upon the power himself, but he couldn't send it back so he entrusted this power to his disciple,\na snake Mahatma Kaaldoot. Minor portions of the power passed on to his future generations and resulted in a new\nspecies of snakes the Ichchhadhari naags (shape-shifting snakes). Most of the snakes don't know all the uses of\nthis power and used it only for shape-shifting purposes but this power can do anything, even creating living beings.\nIt is least used but most effective power of Nagraj, celestial as its origin is this power's true extent was unknown to\neveryone for quite a long time. Since Nagraj had lost a very major part of this power\ncourtsey See Through, he doesn't try stupid stunts and makes minimum use of this power cause if he tries shapeshifting\ninto something beyond his power limit then he might not be able to reform a new body and left bodiless like See\nThrough or maybe even die.\nApplications of this power:\n<br />Shape-shifting\n</p>\n<dl><dd>Nagraj even when limited on power has been seen successfully switching between his real and snake form. He can use this power to divide his body into particles and rejoin them within 3 seconds making him invisible and intangible temporarily. At times in case of emergencies Nagraj has temporarily taken powers from the ichchhadhaari naags of Nagdweep granting him access to use the full extent of this power. Nagraj also has a number of ichchhadhaari naags in his body, and though he hasn't yet, he can take their powers too, in times of emergency. Nagraj when high on this power can undergo amazing transformations and can change into anything imaginable. In theory, this power has no limits.</dd></dl>\n<p><br />Hypnotism\n</p>\n<dl><dd>Nagraj has a unique hypnotic effect, formerly considered a separate power, this power was later explained as an</dd></dl>\n<p>application of his ichchhadhaari shakti. Utilizing this power Nagraj can cast a hypnotic reality upon his surroundings using\nhis eyes.[1] Breaking this hypnotic fate is extremely difficult and going against it is impossible. Nagraj\nand his snakes can cast normal hypnotism too.\n<br />Body-fusions\n</p>\n<dl><dd>Nagraj at times has used this power to fuse with his allies to bring down a powerful enemy. He can perform two types of</dd></dl>\n<p>fusions&#160;:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Multi-membered imperfect fusion&#160;: In this type of fusion many people can join together to form a single body having</li></ul>\n<p>many heads and hands. Every individual retains his or her own identity and set of powers. Nagraj used it for the first time\nfusing with the legendary five in order to fight against a creature created by Nagina .\n</p>\n<ul><li>Two-membered perfect fusion&#160;: In this type of fusion Nagraj can join together with a single person to form a whole new</li></ul>\n<p>identity. The new identity has new set of powers born from the combination of the participants' sets of powers. Nagraj\ndisplayed this power for the first time fusing with Lava to become Agni-Nagraj (Fire-Nagraj). The new born identity could\nrelease 'burning snakes' and could breathe 'venomous fire'.\nPsychic powers\n<br />Telepathy\nIn addition to his ability to communicate with snakes, Nagraj contacted Super Commando Dhruva telepathically when he\nwas trapped in a parallel dimension containing evil souls.\n<br />Psychic force\n</p>\n<dl><dd>In the debutant issue of Nagraj, after his introduction Professor Nagmani said&#160;: This later proved to be true, when Nagraj</dd></dl>\n<p>achieved the feat using his ichchhadhaari shakti. Though the latter claim has not been substantiated, Nagraj's psychic\npotential has been demonstrated during his battle with the Mahamanav (an advanced creature having enough psychic\ncapabilities to wipe out entire planets) in a psychic power battle.\n</p>\n<ul><li>Nagraj's primary power is his ability to contain millions of snakes inside his body, becoming a host for a variety of snakes. He can order them to come out of his body and attack his opponents, and also instruct them to create simple forms, such as ropes, lassos, webs, gloves, pipes, etc., as well as complex forms, such as a parachute, boat, gliders, and many others.</li>\n<li>Aside from ordinary snakes, he also has a wide variety of mystical snakes like Jagmag Sarp, snakes with bodies that shine brightly in the dark, Naagfani Sarp, snakes with stretchable, spike-covered bodies, which can pierce through anything and elongate themselves as well, Dhwansak Sarp, explosive snakes which explodes as soon as their body come in contact with anything, Maanas Sarp, psionic snakes which enable Nagraj to split his astral psyche from his body, Udan Sarp, winged snakes which can fly, among others. These snakes multiply rapidly, thus making them limitless in numbers.</li>\n<li>He also hosts several Icchadhari Sarp, shape-shifting snakes, in his body, such as Sheetnaag Kumar, The Prince of Sheetnaags, who has the ability to manipulate ice, Saudangi, an Egyptian snake woman who is a master of Tantra-Kala, or sorcery, Naagu, a Manidhhari snake, which is a snake with a diamond like gem on his forehead, whose 'Mani' grants him powers such as shape-shifting, illusion-casting, energy-based attacks, etc., and the Vilakshana Naags. These snakes can come out of his body at will and aid him in battles.</li>\n<li>Nagraj's body holds the most dangerous venom and thus his bite is fatal to almost every human being and Naags in this world. Anyone he bites, or vice versa, melts to nothing in a few seconds. His breath also consists of some amount of this venom, thus enabling Nagraj to concentrate all this venom into his one breath, which he calls Vish-Funkaar, which results in a quick death for anyone who inhales it. He can also spit this venom on others, which he uses in his Vish-Funkaar, which is equally dangerous and fatal. This venom is combined in his blood, thus anyone who tastes his blood die almost instantly.</li>\n<li>All of Nagraj's physical attributes have reached super-human level, and his strength, stamina, durability, agility, reflexes, and speed are far beyond the peak human level.</li>\n<li>He also has accelerated healing factor, which heals any wounds almost instantly, thanks to the millions of snakes in his body who aid in the healing. Thus guns, swords, blades, etc. are useless against him.</li>\n<li>All of his primary senses have been enhanced to super-human level, which makes his eyesight and hearing far better than any human. He can also sense vibrations in the environment, thus allowing him to navigate and combat even without using his eyesight. He also has a sixth-sense, which he uses if his other five senses are not of much help. Being a highly poisonous human-snake (He refuses to be called a snake-man), poisons and drugs have absolutely no effect on him, making him immune to them.</li>\n<li>Being an <a href=\"/wiki/Ichchhadhari_Nag\" title=\"Ichchhadhari Nag\">Ichchhadhari</a>, he has shape-shifting abilities and can shape-shift into any creature or person he desires. He can also use this power to grow wings, claws, as well as fins on his body for better navigation and combat. Thanks to his shape-shifting abilities, he can grow his size and proportional strength to even higher levels. Although he lost many of his shape-shifting powers during the events of the issue \"Icchadhari\", still he retains his ability to turn into a snake at will. He can also use his Icchadhari shakti to break free his atoms, rendering himself invisible and intangible, to dodge attacks and pass through barriers, though he can only remain in this form for three seconds. His Icchadhari shakti also protects his head from any assaults and attacks, thus any telepathic or electromagnetic attack on his brain backfires on the source.</li>\n<li>Nagraj possesses the ability to shed his skin, in the same way as a snake sheds its Kenchuli, in case some harmful substance, like acid, comes in contact with his skin.</li>\n<li>Nagraj can also stick to surfaces and climb walls in a way some snakes do.</li>\n<li>He is a master of hypnotism and can hypnotise anyone in a matter of seconds, to cast illusions and force the victims into believing or obeying whatever he tells them.</li>\n<li>Nagraj has reached a level of strength considered superhuman. He can easily hold a car or throw a bus in air without a problem, as seen in his comic \"Venom\" in which he was badly injured, having most of his bones broken, but to save the people from a fire dragon, he managed to lift up a 100 tones kilogram globe and threw it into the mouth of the fire dragon, which was flying 100&#160;meters above the ground.</li>\n<li>Nagraj also possess some unknown amount of psychic powers which is very dangerous and he can increase his psychic powers with the help of his snake.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Known_relatives_and_close_friends\">Known relatives and close friends</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Nagraj&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Known relatives and close friends\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Nagraj, along with his deeds, has earned a large amount of friends, many of whom appeared just once, but some that appeared more often, and still fewer that became permanent figures in Nagraj's stories.

It was first intended to be a four-part mini-series, but later, the series was extended to include more issues. Raj Comics has also decided to publish it worldwide. It's a story based on a hypothetical future world casting Nagraj and <a href=\"/wiki/Super_Commando_Dhruva\" title=\"Super Commando Dhruva\">Super Commando Dhruva</a> 25 years into the future. Largely based on Hindu epic <a href=\"/wiki/Ramayana\" title=\"Ramayana\">Ramayana</a>, the story narrowly follows the same storyline as of the epic, but with Raj Comics characters filling in the places of original characters.
