A wound healing assay is a laboratory technique used to study cell migration and cellâ€“cell interaction.  This is also called a scratch assay because it is done by making a scratch on a cell monolayer and capturing images at regular intervals by time lapse microscope.   While it has been described as straightforward, the technique has been criticized because of inconsistencies in its application from one experiment to another.
