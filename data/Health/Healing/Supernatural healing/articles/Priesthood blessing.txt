A priesthood blessing in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) is a "prayer for healing, comfort or counsel given by a Melchizedek Priesthood holder, who lays his hands on the head of the person receiving the blessing."  Priesthood blessings are considered to be non-saving ordinances by Latter-day Saints.
