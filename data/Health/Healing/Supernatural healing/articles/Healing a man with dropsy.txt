Healing a man with dropsy is one of the miracles of Jesus in the Gospels (Luke 14:1-6).    According to the Gospel, one Sabbath, Jesus went to eat in the house of a prominent Pharisee, and he was being carefully watched. There in front of him was a man suffering from dropsy, i.e. abnormal swelling of his body.  Jesus asked the Pharisees and experts in the law: But they remained silent. So taking hold of the man, he healed him and sent him on his way. Then he asked them: And they had nothing to say.
