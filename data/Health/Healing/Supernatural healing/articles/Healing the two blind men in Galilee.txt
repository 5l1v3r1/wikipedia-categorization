Jesus healing two blind men is a miracle attributed to Jesus in the Gospel of Matthew.   It follows immediately on the account of the Daughter of Jairus.  According to the Gospel account, as Jesus continues his journey after raising the daughter of Jairus, two blind men follow him, calling out, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"  When he had gone indoors, the blind men come to him, and he asksÂ : "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" They reply, "Yes, Lord". He then touches their eyes, and says, "According to your faith let it be done to you";  and their sight is restored. He warns them sternly, to tell nobody, but they go and spread the news of the healing 'throughout that district'.  The story is a loose adaptation of one in Gospel of Mark, of the healing of a blind man called Bartimeus. In a practice characteristic of the author of the Matthew Gospel, the number of persons is doubled and unnecessary details removed. The same story is told later in the same Gospel (Matthew 20:29-34) with almost identical details.  The author of the Matthew Gospel introduces the term 'Son of David' to indicate that the healings show Jesus as the Messiah.
