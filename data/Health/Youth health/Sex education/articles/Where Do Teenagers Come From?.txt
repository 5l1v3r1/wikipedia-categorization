Where Do Teenagers Come From? was an American television teen comedy/documentary that aired as an ABC Afterschool Special on March 5, 1980. The live action/animation  program was produced by DePatie-Freleng Enterprises and was a sequel to the 1977 program My Mom's Having a Baby. The special was notable for its signature song "Growing Up," written by Doug Goodwin.  When 12-year-old Kelly begins to experience changes in her body, she, along with Petey and Oscar,  once again visit Dr. Lendon Smith, who uses an animated film that explains in detail (via Smith's narraration) of how teenagers, especially young girls, experience adolescence and how her body changes. As with the first outing, it also had its share of criticism for using a daytime program to showcase what was seen as sex education. However, this sequel was not as popular as the first outing.
