Fatal bear attacks in North America have occurred in a variety of settings.  There have been several in the bears' wilderness habitats involving hikers, hunters, and campers.   Brown bear incidents have occurred in their native range spanning Alaska, Northern and Western Canada, and portions of the Rocky Mountains in the United States.  The locations of black bear wilderness fatal attacks reflect their wider range: all Canadian Provinces except the Atlantic Provinces and several major mountainous areas in the United States. Bears held captive by animal trainers, in zoos, carnivals, or kept as pets have been responsible for several attacks. There have also been unusual cases in which a person entered a bear's cage and was then mauled. Bear attacks are rare in North America.     Attacks are for predatory, territorial, or protective reasons.   Most wilderness attacks have occurred when there were only one or two people in the vicinity.   In this list, three species of bear are recognized: the brown bear (Ursus arctos, commonly known as the grizzly bear), the American black bear (Ursus americanus), and the polar bear (Ursus maritimus). The photographs in White's camera showed that he was taking photos of the bear in a span of eight minutes from 50 yards (46 m) to 100 yards (91 m).   It was the first fatal bear attack recorded in Denali National Park.  DNA evidence later determined that the same sow that killed Brian Matayoshi July 6, 2011 was in the vicinity of Wallace's corpse, though it was not proved that this bear killed Wallace.  The bear was killed by park officials.   Evidence showed that Wallace was attacked after sitting down on a log to eat a snack and the attack was predatory, rather than defensive.   An initial investigation by the National Park Service found the bear's actions were defensive against a perceived threat to her cubs.  Since the attack was not predatory and the bear had no known violent history towards humans, no immediate action was taken towards the bear, the bear was later euthanized after it was found to be at the site of another fatal attack August 24, 2011.     A later investigation determined that the couple running from the bear was a mistake, and the fatal attack was a "one in 3 million occurrence".   Initially it was reported that Evert ignored posted warnings to avoid the area due to the potential danger involved with the bear research.  However, the sheriff's deputy who recovered the body and members of Evert's family stated that the warning signs were no longer present.  A report released the following month confirmed that the warning signs were removed, though it also asserted that Evert knew there was a bear research study being conducted in the area.   Evert's wife filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the federal government, which was dismissed by district court judge Nancy D. Freudenthal.   Fish and wildlife officers shot and killed the bear.   At the time of the attack, the trail was closed, and the public was told to avoid it.   A few days prior, the bear had been relocated from Canmore to Banff National Park.  McConnell's son received a Star of Courage for his attempt to save his mother. Kitchen also received the honor, posthumously.  Although Helgeson and Koons were killed on the same night, these were separate attacks by different bears approximately 9 miles (14 km) apart.  Both bears were killed two nights after their attacks.    A black bear searching garbage pails in Yellowstone National Park, circa 1905.  Bear attacks on humans led to changes in park's garbage management procedures. A man wrestling with a trained bear. There have been instances of bears killing their trainers. Hansen's sister sought, and eventually successfully received compensation for expenses incurred to care for Martha. Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed a bill in 1944 granting the family $1894.95.  Eventually, a man operating a nearby roadside stand came and shot and killed the bear.  An examination revealed that the bear hadn't eaten in two days.   The Inn had two bears that were trapped five years previously in the Adirondacks, and were frequently fed by passers-by.  Both bears were killed.         Species:
