This is a list of cases from the January 1918 â€“ December 1920 flu pandemic, commonly referred to as the Spanish flu. To maintain morale, wartime censors minimized early reports of illness and mortality in Germany, the United Kingdom, France, and the United States.   Papers were free to report the epidemic's effects in neutral Spain (such as the grave illness of King Alfonso XIII).  This created a false impression of Spain as especially hard hit,  thereby giving rise to the pandemic's nickname, "Spanish Flu".  Listed alphabetically by surname Children of women who were pregnant during the pandemic ran the risk of lifelong effects. One in three of the more than 25 million who contracted the flu in the United States was a woman of childbearing age. A study of US census data from 1960 to 1980 found that the children born to this group of women had more physical ailments and a lower lifetime income than those born a few months earlier or later.  The study also found that persons born in states with more severe exposure to the pandemic experienced worse outcomes than persons born in states with less severe exposures.
