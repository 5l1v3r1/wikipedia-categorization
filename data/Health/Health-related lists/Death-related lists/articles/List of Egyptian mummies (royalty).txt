The following is a list of mummies that include Egyptian Pharaohs and their named mummified family members.[a] Some of these mummies have been found to be remarkably intact, while others have been damaged from tomb robbers and environmental conditions. Given the technology/wealth at the time, all known predynastic rulers were buried in open tombs. It was not until Pharaoh Den of the first dynasty that things such as a staircase and architectural elements were added which provided better protection from the elements.  Additionally, most early rulers were buried,  and mummification became prevalent only in the later dynasties.[when?]  The following entries are previously identified mummies that are now in dispute. Over time through the advance in technology, new information comes to light that discredits old findings and beliefs. The mummies that have been lost or destroyed since initial discovery may never be properly identified.
