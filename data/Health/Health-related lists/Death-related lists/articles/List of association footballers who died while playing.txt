 The following is a list of association footballers who died while playing a game, died directly from injuries sustained while playing, or died after being taken ill on the pitch. Following an increase in deaths,  both during matches and training, the Federation of International Football Associations (FIFA) considered mandatory cardiac testing,  already in place for years in some countries, such as Italy.  By 2009, FIFA player Pre-Competition Medical Assessment (PCMA) included family history, heart rhythm, sounds, and electrocardiogram (ECG) results.  The Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) required extensive medical tests, including ECG and echocardiogram for players in the Europa League 2011â€“12.  Constant monitoring has been advised.
