 The first documented deaths of professional cyclists during competition date to the 1890s. Before 1929 at least 47 professional riders and pacemakers[Note 1] died at velodromes in track cycling [Note 2] and since 1994 a number of professionals have been killed in accidents with motorized vehicles while training on public roads.  The dangers of cycling continue to be disputed among modern sources. For example, the 2005 United States Consumer Products Safety Commission (CPSC) data showed bicycling to be nearly as dangerous as American football.  A survey of 2008 Olympics teams, however, indicated that cycling was not even in the top six most injury-prone sports during competition that year.  Verbist is the subject of a macabre Flemish folk-poem... "Chareltje, Chareltje Verbist, hadt ge niet gereden op de pist(e), hadt ge niet gelegen in de kist."  which roughly translates to "Verbist, if you hadnâ€™t ridden your bike, you may not have ended up in a coffin." These athletes did not die during competition, but rather died during training, during scheduled breaks while participating in a professional race or from another reason related to cycling.  Since 1994, at least twenty-eight professional cyclists have been killed after being struck by a car or truck while training.
