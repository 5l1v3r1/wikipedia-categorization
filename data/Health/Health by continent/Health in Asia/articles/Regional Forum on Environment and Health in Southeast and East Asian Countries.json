enhancing economic growth and social equity to reduce poverty, promoting the health and well-being of people and encouraging partnerships and cooperation among stakeholders and countries in the region.\nWithout environmental and health protection, development is undermined. Without economic growth (essential to poverty reduction and improving the quality of life), protection of the environment and promotion of health will also fail.\nThe Regional Forum's vision is to safeguard and enhance health and the environment, promoting development which reduces poverty.\nThe interplay of health and environment and their role in poverty reduction needs to be understood and addressed.\nThis can be achieved by a national approach that integrates the efforts of stakeholders in preserving the environment with the protection of human health and well-being. The regional forum also believes that national efforts for environmental preservation and health protection may be affected by development activities and environmental and health conditions in neighboring countries. Thus, greater regional partnership and cooperation are needed to address common interests and threats to the region.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Goals_and_objectives\">Goals and
