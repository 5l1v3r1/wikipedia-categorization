The Health Information Systems Programme (HISP), aims to support the improvement of health care systems in the southern hemisphere by increasing the capacity of health care workers to make decisions based on accurate information. HISP provides training and support for users of the open source District Health Information System (DHIS 2) software, which is under continuous development. The global network of HISP is managed and coordinated by the Department of Informatics at the University of Oslo.  The project started in post-apartheid South Africa, and has been introduced in a number of countries in Africa and Asia.
