David Goldhill was the president and CEO of the Game Show Network.   Prior to this position, he was the president of the Universal Television Group.   David Goldhill's article in The Atlantic was the cover story for its September 2009 issue.   In it, he argues that dysfunction in the health care sector in America exists because markets in the health care sector are not being allowed to function properly.  He thus advocates mandatory accounts into which people would pay a minimum percentage of their income every year.  People would receive government coverage for truly catastrophic, unforeseen medical emergencies and procedures, like those costing more than $50,000.  Foreseeable medical procedures, such as pregnancy and end-of-life care, would be paid for from the individual savings accounts. He opposes a single payer system, because he believes it would be influenced by lobbyists.  He has published a book on this topic, "Catastrophic Care:  How American Health Care Killed My Father--And How We Can Fix It", released in the United States on January 8, 2013. He is a self-identified Democrat.   His book and articles have received praise from conservative news outlet The Weekly Standard and the libertarian think-tank the Cato Institute.
