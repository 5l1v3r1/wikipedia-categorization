 Executive Order 13765 is the first executive order signed by U.S. President Donald Trump on January 20, 2017, which set out interim procedures in anticipation of repeal of Obamacare.   The executive order came on Trump's campaign pledges to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and occurred just hours after he was sworn into office.  Trump stated sorting out a replacement will take a long time and the replacement may not be ready until 2018.  Following several failed efforts by Congress to pass an alternative to the ACA, Trump issued another executive order in October 2017, the Executive Order to Promote Healthcare Choice and Competition, which some proponents and opponents asserted effectively replaced the ACA with a new healthcare regime.   The order was designed to weaken regulations and procedures associated with enforcement of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.    It was broken into six sections: In February 2017, it was reported that the Internal Revenue Service would not require tax filers to state whether they had compliant insurance, allowing them to avoid the penalty fine.  The IRS said that this change would reduce administrative burdens on taxpayers.  It was criticized for weakening an enforcement mechanism that lowers premiums by supporting wide participation in the markets.
