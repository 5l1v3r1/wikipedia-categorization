Real world data (RWD) in medicine is data derived from a number of sources that are associated with outcomes in a heterogeneous patient population in real-world settings, such as patient surveys, clinical trials, and  observational cohort studies.  Real-world data refer to observational data as opposed to data gathered in an experimental setting such as a randomized controlled trial (RCT). They are derived from Electronic health records (EHRs), claims and billing activities, product and disease registries, etc.  "Real World Evidence" at FDA
