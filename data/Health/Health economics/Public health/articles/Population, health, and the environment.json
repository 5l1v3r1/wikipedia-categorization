Conservation work is usually located in these remote areas to protect the remaining biodiversity. In the developing world , the communities in these remote areas often suffer from ill health because of limited access to health services or <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.cfr.org/women/population-environment-connections/p24656\">family planning</a>. These communities also tend to suffer from poor <a href=\"/wiki/Nutrition\" title=\"Nutrition\">nutrition</a>, water supplies or <a href=\"/wiki/Sanitation\" title=\"Sanitation\">sanitation</a>. Inadequate <a href=\"/wiki/Health_care\" title=\"Health care\">health care</a> in these communities is usually because of economic struggles. Livelihoods in the rural communities depend on natural resources and small-scale agriculture, which can force people to use natural resources unsustainably because of pressures such as rapid <a href=\"/wiki/Population_growth\" title=\"Population growth\">population growth</a> or health issues. This can be damaging to <a href=\"/wiki/Ecosystem\" title=\"Ecosystem\">ecosystems</a> and the biodiversity in these rural areas.\n</p><p>Conversely, people\u2019s health relies on the <a href=\"/wiki/Environmental_health\" title=\"Environmental health\">health of their environment</a>. Their surrounding ecosystem provides them with goods and services such as water, food, medicine, fuel wood, building materials, and other resources.  Damage or disruption of these natural goods and services can have severe consequences for <a href=\"/wiki/Human_health\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Human health\">human health</a>.\n</p><p>Projects that take the PHE approach work to create <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/issue-23-to-live-the-sea-reproductive-health-care-and-marine-conservation-madagascar\">healthier communities and ecosystems</a>. These projects aim to bring better health services to remote communities to improve participation in conservation efforts. PHE projects also promote family planning services to help slow population growth that can put pressure on <a href=\"/wiki/Natural_resource\" title=\"Natural resource\">natural resources</a>. That means PHE approaches strive to simultaneously improve access to health services while helping communities manage their natural resources in ways that improve their health and livelihood even as they protect the environment. Beyond this, the PHE approach also targets synergies between human health and <a href=\"/wiki/Ecosystem_health\" title=\"Ecosystem health\">ecosystem health</a> by including a wide spectrum of development and conservation targets such as the sustainable management of natural resources, improving livelihoods, <a href=\"/wiki/Food_security\" title=\"Food security\">food security</a> and nutrition, and by maintaining or restoring habitats and ecosystem functions.  By focusing on the <a href=\"/wiki/Synergy\" title=\"Synergy\">synergy</a> between communities and their environment, the PHE approach conserves biodiversity while at the same time improving environmental health conditions for the local people. PHE is effective at achieving a wide range of positive results over multiple sectors.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"History_of_PHE\">History of PHE</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Population,_health,_and_the_environment&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: History of PHE\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In the late 1980s conservation organizations and practitioners began to realize the benefits of improving the <a href=\"/wiki/Quality_of_life\" title=\"Quality of life\">quality of life</a> for people by managing biodiversity and natural resources. These projects were initially called <a href=\"/wiki/Integrated_Conservation_and_Development_Project\" title=\"Integrated Conservation and Development Project\">integrated conservation and development projects</a> (ICDP) and addressed a wide variety of community development needs. At the end of the 1990s it was realized that ICDPs were not achieving conservation or development goals as successfully as anticipated. This was because the scope of ICDPs was often too broad. One of the lessons learned from ICDP attempts was that the success of the projects depended on the ability to focus on key interventions and avoid excessive complexity. From the lessons learned from early ICDPs the conservation sector gave birth to the PHE approach with a new generation of integrated projects.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Program_designer\" title=\"Program designer\">Program designers</a> began to realize that efforts to conserve biological diversity (biodiversity) in developing countries was most successful in long-term indicators when local people perceived their efforts as serving their economic and cultural interests. This gave birth to the integrated development approach. To achieve success it was found that ICDPs had to consider the linkage between conservation and development objectives in every unique place that the project was implemented. The first step to determining the linkages is to consider where the conservation and <a href=\"/wiki/Economic_development\" title=\"Economic development\">economic development</a> goals intersect. Development interventions should then be introduced where this intersection occurs.\n</p><p>One of the most important lessons learned from ICDPs in the last 20 years was the failure to equitably involve projected beneficiaries as partners in all phases of project implementation, from design through evaluation, has led to consistently disappointing project results. It must be recognized that local participants are not a homogenous group of community members but differ widely in terms of access and dependency of resources, economic positions and their sensitivity to <a href=\"/wiki/Environmental_change\" title=\"Environmental change\">environmental changes</a>. These lessons learned from past ICDPs has led the design of the <a href=\"/wiki/Stakeholder_analysis\" title=\"Stakeholder analysis\">stakeholder analysis</a> where individuals or groups vested in the project are identified and incorporated into all stages of project design and implementation.\n</p><p>Drawing on what was learned from ICDPs, the conservation sector piloted the PHE approach during the 1990s with the first generation of PHE integrated projects. Since then USAID (the <a href=\"/wiki/United_States_Agency_for_International_Development\" title=\"United States Agency for International Development\">United States Agency for International Development</a>), the <a href=\"/wiki/David_and_Lucile_Packard_Foundation\" title=\"David and Lucile Packard Foundation\">David and Lucile Packard Foundation</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Johnson_%26_Johnson\" title=\"Johnson &amp; Johnson\">Johnson &amp; Johnson</a>, and the Summit Foundation have worked to strengthen the approach. The PHE approach has pushed on with the <a href=\"/wiki/United_Nations\" title=\"United Nations\">United Nations</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Millennium_Development_Goals\" title=\"Millennium Development Goals\">Millennium Development Goals</a> (MDG) in mind. As the PHE approach advances it has demonstrated to have the kind of synergies needed to reach these goals.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Past_PHE_Project_Profiles\">Past PHE Project Profiles</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Population,_health,_and_the_environment&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Past PHE Project Profiles\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><b>Successful Communities from Ridge to Reef, Kenya:</b>\nThis project was implemented in an area designated a <a href=\"/wiki/UNESCO\" title=\"UNESCO\">UNESCO</a> reserve in the <a href=\"/wiki/Kiunga_Marine_National_Reserve\" title=\"Kiunga Marine National Reserve\">Kiunga National Marine Reserve</a>. The reserve has outstanding <a href=\"/wiki/Marine_biodiversity\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Marine biodiversity\">marine biodiversity</a> of over 11,000 species, 60-70% of which are endemic to the <a href=\"/wiki/Indo-Pacific\" title=\"Indo-Pacific\">Indo-Pacific</a> Ocean. The <a href=\"/wiki/World_Wildlife_Fund\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"World Wildlife Fund\">World Wildlife Fund</a> (WWF) with funding from USAID, was able to provide communities that depend on the reserve\u2019s resources access to family planning through a mobile clinic. Members of the community began to actively participate in conservation activities once they know WWF was willing to help them meet basic health needs.\n</p><p><b>Healthy Families, Health Forests, Cambodia:</b>\nWhen refugees from the <a href=\"/wiki/Cambodia\" title=\"Cambodia\">Cambodia</a>/<a href=\"/wiki/Vietnam\" title=\"Vietnam\">Vietnam</a> war in the 1970s returned to their homes they found their land had been destroyed through logging and agriculture. With USAID support, <a href=\"/wiki/Conservation_International\" title=\"Conservation International\">Conservation International</a> helped the Khmer Daeum <a href=\"/wiki/Refugee\" title=\"Refugee\">refugees</a> to replenish their land and supplied the refugees with their first-ever access to family planning. Healthy families were able to develop long-term plans for sustainable <a href=\"/wiki/Land_use\" title=\"Land use\">land use</a> and local women created associations that mobilized the community to increase income earning opportunities and strengthen participation in conservation activities.\n</p><p><b>Integrated Population and Coastal Resource Management (IPOPCORM), Philippines</b>\nRapid population growth in the <a href=\"/wiki/Philippines\" title=\"Philippines\">Philippines</a> has led to <a href=\"/wiki/Deforestation\" title=\"Deforestation\">deforestation</a> and destruction of <a href=\"/wiki/Coral_reef\" title=\"Coral reef\">coral reefs</a>. Only 3% of original forest cover remains and only 5% of coral reefs are intact and in pristine condition. This uncontrollable population growth, coupled with the depletion of coastal resources led to the development of the Integrated Population and Coastal Resource Management (IPOPCORM) project with support from USAID and PATH Foundation Philippines Inc. The IPOPCORM Project focuses on communities in the Philippines\u2019 most endangered coastal reef areas and works to improve food security and livelihoods by promoting family planning and sustainable <a href=\"/wiki/Fisheries_management\" title=\"Fisheries management\">fisheries management</a>. The program has earned strong support from local mayors and community members who have appreciated IPOPCORM\u2019s focus on improving livelihoods.\n</p><p><b>Population and Resource Management in Madagascar</b>\n<a href=\"/wiki/Africa\" title=\"Africa\">Africa</a>\u2019s greatest concentration of unique plant and animal species can be found in <a href=\"/wiki/Madagascar\" title=\"Madagascar\">Madagascar</a>.

The community-based approach aimed to improve the livelihoods in Tanzanian communities while promoting conservation and an understanding of the need to preserve biodiversity. This approach provides family planning methods, information, and counseling by community volunteers that has resulted in a greater acceptance of family planning.
