The Minnesota Nurses Association (MNA) is a labor union representing registered nurses in the state of Minnesota.  They are affiliated with National Nurses United, a national nurses union promoting guaranteed nurse-to-patient staffing ratios.  On June 10, 2010, the MNA staged a one-day walkout strike to protest wage freezes and pension decreases, and to advocate for guaranteed nurse-to-patient staffing ratios.  The MNA said it was the largest nurses strike in United States history, with more than 12,000 union members involved.
