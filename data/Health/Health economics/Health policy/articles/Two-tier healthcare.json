The federal government distributes funds to the provinces for healthcare providing the provinces design their systems to meet certain criteria which they all do. Most people receiving care in Canada do not pay for their care. The medical provider gets paid a fixed fee for the care provided. The law bans the medical provider from charging patients to supplement their income from Medicare. Medical care providers can set their own fees that are higher than the Medicare reimbursement fee, but the patient must pay all the cost of care, not just the excess.\n</p><p>About 70% of Canada's healthcare funding is via the public system. Another 30% comes from private funding, divided approximately equally between out-of-pocket funding and private insurance, which may be complementary (meeting costs not covered by the public system such as the cost of prescription medicines, dental treatments and copayments) or supplementary (adding more choice of provider or providing faster access to care)<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> There are, however, financial disincentives that make private medicine for services that are covered by Medicare less economic.\n</p><p>Six of Canada's ten provinces used to ban private insurance for publicly insured services to inhibit queue jumping and so preserve fairness in the health care system. In 2005, the <a href=\"/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Canada\" title=\"Supreme Court of Canada\">Supreme Court of Canada</a> ruled that in Quebec, such bans are unconstitutional if the waiting period for care is excessively long. However, this ruling only applies within the Province of Quebec. A second court challenge is currently underway to determine whether the prohibition of private parallel health care violates the patients' right to life, liberty, and security under Section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. \n</p><p>Some private hospitals operating while the national healthcare plan was instituted (for example, the <a href=\"/wiki/Shouldice_Hernia_Centre\" title=\"Shouldice Hernia Centre\">Shouldice Hernia Centre</a> in <a href=\"/wiki/Thornhill,_Ontario\" title=\"Thornhill, Ontario\">Thornhill, Ontario</a>) continue to operate, but they may not bill additional charges for medical procedures. (The Shouldice Hospital, however, has mandatory additional room charges not covered by public health insurance. That effectively places it in the \"upper tier\" of a two-tier system. Welfare recipients, for example, cannot be referred there.)\n</p><p>Clinics are usually private operations but may not bill additional charges. Private healthcare may also be supplied, both in uncovered fields and to foreigners.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Denmark\">Denmark</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Two-tier_healthcare&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Denmark\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/Healthcare_in_Denmark\" title=\"Healthcare in Denmark\">Healthcare in Denmark</a>, although primarily subsidised by the government at the county and the national levels health, is supported by complementary insurance plans to cover elective services not covered by the public system; they also help cover copayments.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"France\">France</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Two-tier_healthcare&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: France\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/Healthcare_in_France\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Healthcare in France\">Healthcare in France</a> is a system of private and public physicians, who largely draw their income from the government.

Insurers are all private companies. It is heavily subsidized from tax revenues and heavily regulated, with a common, regulated standard insurance policy coverage set nationwide for all providers and a more flexible top up insurance, which is less regulated and set by each company as it chooses.\n</p><p>Insurers set a standard price for each adult for the year throughout the country and must insure all people who apply for insurance at that price regardless of the age or health status of the applicant. An equalization fund, which is essentially a national sickness fund funded from a form of income tax on employers and employees, is used to pay for the health care of all children and to compensate insurers if they have more high risk profile clients than the other insurers.\n</p><p>Thus, Dutch insurers welcome the sick and the elderly because they are fully compensated for the higher-risk profile of these clients. People living in more expensive areas of the country have to pay higher premiums, since they get less compensation from the government because they can afford to pay more but the elderly and the sick pay the same premiums as everyone else in that region. Social insurance covers the insurance costs of those with limited incomes, such as the unemployed and the permanently disabled.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Singapore\">Singapore</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Two-tier_healthcare&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Singapore\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/Healthcare_in_Singapore\" title=\"Healthcare in Singapore\">Healthcare in Singapore</a> uses a true two-tier system for both the provider network and the insurance funds.

That is a taxable benefit to the employee, the value imputed by the tax authorities as income to the beneficiary. Because NHS services are so comprehensive, there are many areas in which the private sector usually does not compete and private insurers almost always refuse to fund. Childbirth and perinatal services are good examples.\n</p><p>Conversely, there are some areas where the NHS does not offer free treatment (<a href=\"/wiki/Cosmetic_surgery\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cosmetic surgery\">cosmetic surgery</a> for vanity purposes, for example) and so the private sector offers a pay-for-service alternative.\n</p><p>Historically, avoiding waiting lists was the main reason that patients opted out of NHS treatment and into private care. Queues of many months are common. NHS Consultants, who can run both NHS and private services during their NHS contracts, used to be in charge of waiting lists and had a financial incentive to keep the public waiting list long, to ensure a stream of private income to the private business.\n</p><p>Since the Blair government reforms of the NHS, strict rules apply to waiting lists (see <a href=\"/wiki/Hospital_choice_in_the_NHS\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hospital choice in the NHS\">hospital choice in the NHS</a>). That and the allocation of better funding in hospitals both reduced waiting times significantly. Most hospital patients are in fact not admitted from a list at all, and those that do, on average, wait less than 9 weeks. Nobody should wait more than 18 weeks. The 18 weeks is not dead time because it includes the time taken to book a first appointment, to conduct all the tests, for the doctor and patient to agree on the desired treatment, and to book and execute an operation or commence the treatment regime. A patient not seen in the 18-week period without just cause has the legal right to go private at the NHS's expense.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template\" style=\"margin-left:0.1em; white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Words_to_watch#Unsupported_attributions\" title=\"Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch\"><span title=\"The material near this tag may use weasel words or too-vague attribution.

Until recently, few NHS patients were ever treated in private hospitals. In the English NHS, however, there has been greater willingness to outsource some work to the private sector, and so some NHS patients do sometimes gain access to private health care facilities at public expense. The equivalent NHS operations in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland do not often fund treatment outside of their own facilities.\n</p><p>Whether the NHS funds treatment in a private hospital is a decision for the local commissioning health authority based on formal service contracts.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"United_States\">United States</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Two-tier_healthcare&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11\" title=\"Edit section: United States\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Further information: <a href=\"/wiki/Health_care_in_the_United_States\" title=\"Health care in the United States\">Health care in the United States</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Obamacare\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Obamacare\">Obamacare</a></div>\n<p>The United States has a two-tier health system, but most of the population cannot gain access to the public provision tiers.
