Learning health systems (LHS) are healthcare systems in which knowledge generation processes are embedded in daily practice to produce continual improve in care.    The idea was first conceptualised in a 2007 workshop organised by the US Institute of Medicine, building on ideas around evidence-based medicine  and "practice-based evidence".  There has since been increasing interest in the topic, including the creation of the Wiley journal Learning Health Systems.  LHS can be described as having four key elements: They are thus dependent on the use of electronic health records (EHRs) and have inherited the adoption challenges of EHRs.   LHS entail a clinical lifecycle. Patient data is collected, it is amalgamated across multiple patients and a problem is defined.  These are activities largely driven by healthcare professionals. With the support of technology, an analysis is performed, which returns evidence, from which knowledge is generated, which leads to changed clinical practice, and thus to new patient data being collected.    McLachlan and colleagues (2018) suggest a taxonomy of nine LHS classification types:
