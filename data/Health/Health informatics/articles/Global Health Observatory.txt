The Global Health Observatory (GHO) is an initiative of the World Health Organization to share data (through their website) on global health, including statistics by country and information about specific diseases and health measures.  In December 2012, the World Health Organization announced that it was making improvements in its Global Health Observatory to improve its accessibility and usability by "specialists such as statisticians, epidemiologists, economists and public health researchers as well as anyone with an interest in global health."  The GHO website is organized around themes. For each theme, key statistics are presented on the associated webpage, and more detailed data and reports are available for download. The themes include:  The GHO has been listed by many libraries and dataset listings as a go-to source for information on health statistics.     The GHO has also been cited in work of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States.  GHO data has also been cited in academic studies on various aspects of global health, particularly for cross-country comparisons.   Official website
