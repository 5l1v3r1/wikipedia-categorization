Mobile Patient Diaries are the next generation Patient Diaries that can use mobile phones during clinical and behavioral trials or a disease treatment and management, to measure treatment compliance and capture patient related information. Patient Diaries have long been maintained on paper, however, with the fast moving mobile phone and communication / digital revolution, patient data capture using mobile phones has come up to be a common practice. Mobile phones can be used for capturing Quality of Life, Health Related Quality Of Life and other assessments during clinical trials and research studies. Mobile phone applications can be used as an innovative solution that allows the clinical and research fraternity to get access to patient information in real time and thereby make important decisions with respect to the ongoing trial. Using mobile phones as patient diaries could play an important role to ensure that the patients enrolled in a clinical trial are compliant to their assessment filling regimens, by sending timely and scheduled alerts and follow ups for filling up their assessments. Mobile technology also enables multiple languages and real time data capture to be inbuilt in the devices to cater to the growing global patient populations that participate in clinical and behavioral trials.
