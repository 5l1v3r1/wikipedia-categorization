The National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) is a survey conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics division of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to understand trends related to fertility, family structure, and demographics in the United States.  The National Survey of Family Growth is conducted in five-year cycles. In each cycle, surveys are administered via personal interviews with people at homes. The interviewees generally comprise only the civilian, non-institutionalized population.  The cycles so far have been:  While Cycles 1-5 surveyed only women, Cycle 6 and later surveyed both men and women and used households as the unit of analysis. Cycle 6 surveyed 12,571 respondents 15â€“44 years of age: 7,643 females and 4,928 males. The 2006-2010 NSFG surveyed 22,682 interviews: over 10,000 interviews with men and more than 12,000 interviews with women.  For Cycle 6 onward, the surveys were conducted in person by female interviewers who are hired and managed by the University of Michigan Institute for Social Research.  The survey samples are intended to be nationally representative but not necessarily representative at subnational levels (such as individual states, ethnicities, or religions).  For the survey cycles that have been completed, data is available both in the form of portable document format summaries and as full data files. In addition, program statements are available in SAS, SPSS, and STATA.  Key statistics are also browsable online.  NSFG data is also mirrored on the website of the University of Michigan's Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research.  The NSFG website claims that the NSFG is used as follows:  The NSFG website claims that the NSFG has been cited in "more than 600 journal articles, NCHS reports, and book chapters shown in our publication lists."  The research citing the NSFG is concentrated more on topics related to family planning, contraception, abortion, and fertility.
