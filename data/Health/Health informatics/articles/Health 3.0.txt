Health 3.0 is a health-related extension of the concept of Web 3.0 whereby the users' interface with the data and information available on the web is personalized to optimize their experience.  This is based on the concept of the Semantic Web, wherein websites' data is accessible for sorting in order to tailor the presentation of information based on user preferences.  Health 3.0 will use such data access to enable individuals to better retrieve and contribute to personalized health-related information within networked electronic health records, and social networking resources.    Health 3.0 has also been described as the idea of semantically organizing electronic health records to create an Open Healthcare Information Architecture.  Health care could also make use of social media, and incorporate virtual tools for enhanced interactions between health care providers and consumers/patients.  Social networking is a popular and powerful tool for engaging patients in their health care. These virtual communities provide a real-time resource for obtaining health-related knowledge and counselling.  Pew Internet and American Life Project report that greater than 90% of young adults and nearly three quarters of all Americans access the internet on a regular basis. Greater than 60% of online adults regularly access social networking resources. In addition, 80% of internet users search for health-related information.  Definitive evidence of health benefit from interaction with health-related virtual communities is currently lacking as further research needs to be performed.
