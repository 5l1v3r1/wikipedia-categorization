The basic premise of a health scoring concept is that what you can measure, you can manage. If you can measure health and wellness good enough as an indicator, then you can start working with it. None of the available health scores is in medical diagnosis, they're all lifestyle-products where the health score in use is to be understood as an indicator, a number that helps you to work with it.\nThe score typically moves up or down indicating improvement, when it moves up, and vice versa. The simpler health scores available are more static in nature and provide a number based on some inputs provided.  The more sophisticated health scores are dynamic and function in real-time, moving (such as exercise, nutrition, stress and sleep) change.\nMost health scores claim they are based on scientific data. The simpler models use one or a few models, the more sophisticated health scores claim to include a vast amount of models and person-years of clinical data.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Some health scores use in addition to static questionnaires also dynamic and ongoing data, such as captured and tracked by fitness or activity trackers or applications for smartphones, For instance, exercise can be tracked automatically by using a mobile app for smartphones to track the activity, or by using fitness tracking apps or devices from the supplier of the health score solution, or by connecting popular fitness tracking apps such as RunKeeper and activity tracking devices such as Fitbit or UP Jawbone step counters, etc.\nIn the past, available information was limited and lifestyle adjustments were largely made only once a health problem was detected, and then under the guidance of healthcare professionals. Today due partly to the availability of electronic mass media there is a trend among the population to maintain their health on their own terms. This seems to be precipitating a shift away from the reactive model of health to a more proactive approach where the individual works towards the maintenance of their wellness before problems arise. This shift in attitudes is said to have broad implications for both public health and individual companies. Improved health would logically lead to reduced healthcare costs and increase workplace productivity.\n</p><p>A wide array of technologies are now available that allow data to be collected on various components of wellness many of them using a variant of the Health Scoring system. Devices for measuring physical attributes, such as blood pressure, blood glucose, and total cholesterol are also commonly used by patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes or hypertension. Furthermore, devices that can be used by healthy individuals to monitor exercise and energy expenditure are increasingly popular, and range from simple heart rate monitors or step counters to more elaborate computerized exercise machines. These tools provide data on the user\u2019s performance and many can upload the data to further systems to be processed. Undoubtedly, the largest growth area has been in apps, facilitated by the widespread use of tablets and smartphones. Although some of these apps may be gimmicks, many are said to be validated genuine tools to assist in improving health and wellness.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Some of the Health Score using companies such as <a href=\"/wiki/Fitocracy\" title=\"Fitocracy\">Fitocracy</a> have grown to over one million users or more by focusing progress based on what's known as <a href=\"/wiki/Gamification\" title=\"Gamification\">gamification</a> as well as by celebrity exposure with the likes of <a href=\"/wiki/Arnold_Schwarzenegger\" title=\"Arnold Schwarzenegger\">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> promoting their products.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Criticism\">Criticism</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Health_Score&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Criticism\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The large majority of offerings with health scores is in the lifestyle segment and not in medical diagnosis, therefore prospective clinical trials to scientifically prove whether a score is accurate or not, are often missing.\n</p><p>A single integer measuring wellness and health outcomes is subject to many unknown variables and incomplete data.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Products_using_Health_Score\">Products using Health Score</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Health_Score&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Products using Health Score\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li>Humantiv Health Score- App, Citizen Health</li>\n<li>Unity Health Score</li>\n<li>Consumable Science's MyBodyScore</li>\n<li>Customer Health Scoring</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Dacadoo\" title=\"Dacadoo\">Dacadoo</a> Health Score</li>\n<li>Digital Health Score Card - app, Johnson &amp; Johnson</li>\n<li>HealthyEnviron (uses CDC/EPA data to assign a health score based on how the environment affects human health)</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Higi\" title=\"Higi\">Higi</a> Score</li>\n<li>Remedy Social Health Score</li>\n<li>NikeFuel Score</li>\n<li>Nudge score - App</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Life_Time_Fitness\" title=\"Life Time Fitness\">Life Time Fitness</a> myHealthScore</li>\n<li>One Healthscore</li>\n<li><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=TicTrac&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"TicTrac (page does not exist)\">TicTrac</a> Wellness Score</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/United_States_Air_Force\" title=\"United States Air Force\">USAF</a> Health Score</li>\n<li>Cooey Health Score -Health Diary App</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Health_Score&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-Reuters:_dacadoo_Obtains_US_Patent_for_Health_Score-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-Reuters:_dacadoo_Obtains_US_Patent_for_Health_Score_1-0\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><cite class=\"citation web\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://archive.is/20141202151927/http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/06/24/bc-dacadoo-idUKnPn6R1Fd8+94+PRN20140624\">\"Reuters: dacadoo Obtains US Patent for Health Score\"</a>. <i>dacadoo Obtains US Patent for its Health Score and Launches New Website</i>.
