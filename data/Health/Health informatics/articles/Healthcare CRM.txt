Healthcare CRM, also known as Healthcare Relationship Management  , is a broadly used term for a Customer relationship management system, or CRM, used in healthcare.  There are two basic types of healthcare CRMs, one is for a healthcare organization to stay in contact with their patients, the other is for a healthcare organization to stay in contact with referring organizations.

Individuals who are sick, hurt, need a dentist, or need a healthcare provider in some way find one that is suitable to their needs themselves.  Healthcare organizations want to attract new patients or maintain repeating patients so they use a healthcare CRM to manage the relationships with the public. This might be tasks like sending checkup appointment reminders, or birthday cards.  The second way healthcare organizations generate patients is by referring organizations.  If an individual goes to a dentist and that individual needs their wisdom teeth removed, the dentist might refer that patient to an oral surgeon.

Hospitals and specialty clinics use a healthcare CRM to maintain relationships with primary care physicians or other referring healthcare organizations.
