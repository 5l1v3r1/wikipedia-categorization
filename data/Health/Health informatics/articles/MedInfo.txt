MedInfo  is the name of the international medical informatics conference organized initially every 3 years and now every other year by the International Medical Informatics Association. It is the most important international conference in the field with 3000+ health and medical informatics professions attending from all over the world. MedInfo also serves to bring together all officers of the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) Board together with national representatives in the General Assembly of IMIA. The General Assembly elects the officers of IMIA. The IMIA Board consists of the President (the Past or the Elect President), Treasurer and Secretary as its officers. In addition it has other Vice Presidents for targeted areas: Membership, MedInfo, Services, Special Affairs, Strategic Plan Implementation, and Working Groups. With the exception of the President and the Vice President of MedInfo all officers serve a three-year term that can be extended for a second three-year term.  The President is on a 5-year cycle and the Vice President of MedInfo has one 3-year cycle and elected the year before the next Medinfo meeting so that he/she can be mentored through one MedInfo cycle. MedInfo was held every 3 years since its inception in 1974, after 2013 it is now held every two years.  The table below gives an overview of these conferences. Medinfo is also an acronym for Medical Information, often a pharmaceutical information service provided by pharmacovigilance or medical affairs departments.
