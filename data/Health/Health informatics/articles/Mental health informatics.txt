Mental health informatics is a branch of health or clinical informatics concerned with the use of information technology (IT) and information to improve mental health. Like health informatics, mental health informatics is a multidisciplinary field that promotes care delivery, research and education   as well as the technology and methodologies required to implement it. Major areas of mental health informatics activity include: The need for and application of health informatics in primary and secondary health care has been well established in developed countries for 20 years or more.  The application of informatics in mental health has not become as pervasive, in spite of professional recognition    the domain appearing well suited to computerisation   and the need for quantified outcome evidence.  A major impediment may be societal stigma associated with mental disorders as well as increased sensitivity about protecting the privacy and confidentiality of records in mental health care. There also may be a professional reluctance to effect changes in established working patterns that the introduction of systems necessarily entails.
