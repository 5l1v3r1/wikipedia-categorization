FREIDA Online, or Fellowship and Residency Electronic Interactive Database,  is an online database of all graduate medical education programs in the United States that are accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, provided at no charge by the American Medical Association. It can be used to search for programs by specialty in a particular state or geographic region as well as to determine specific aspects about any given program (number of first-year spots, salary, years of training, etc.). Optional search criteria, such as program size, whether the program is university hospital based, etc., can also be used to narrow searches. Aggregate statistics of programs in each specialty are available, as well as aggregate information about program graduates.
