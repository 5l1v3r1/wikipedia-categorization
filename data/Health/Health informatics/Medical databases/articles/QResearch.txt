QResearch is a large consolidated UK database derived from the anonymised health records of over 18 million patients.  As of  2016[update] the data is taken from around 1,000 general practices throughout the UK. Historical records extend back to the early 1990s. The database is open, with ethical restrictions, to academic researchers. The costs are controlled to allow the scheme to be self-funding while allowing good access to researchers.
