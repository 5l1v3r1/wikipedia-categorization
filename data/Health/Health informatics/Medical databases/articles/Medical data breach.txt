A medical data breach is a data breach of health information, and could include either the personal health information of any individual's electronic health record or medical billing information from their health insurance. In February 2015 an NPR report claimed that organized crime networks had ways of selling health data in the black market.  In 2015 a Beazley Group staffperson estimated that medical records could sell on the black market for US$40-50.  Crime is the primary cause of medical data breaches.  Theft, data loss, hacking, and unauthorized account access are ways in which medical data breaches happen.  In the United States, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act require companies to report data breaches to affected individuals and the federal government.
