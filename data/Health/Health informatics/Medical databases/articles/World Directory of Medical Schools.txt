The World Directory of Medical Schools (WDMS) is a public database of institutions that provide medical education.  There are 2,800 operational medical schools listed in the directory. The Directory is published as a collaboration of the World Federation for Medical Education (WFME) and the Foundation for Advancement of International Medical Education and Research (FAIMER). For the database, a "medical school" is defined as an "educational institution that provides a complete or full program of instruction leading to basic medical qualification; that is, a qualification that permits the holder to obtain a license to practice as a medical doctor or physician".  As of  DecemberÂ 2016[update] the database has records for 2,800 medical schools that are operational and more than 100 that have ceased to be operational.  It was  created by merging their respective AVICENNA and IMED directories to produce a single comprehensive resource, including the schools in each of the prior directories.  The decision to merge the AVICENNA and IMED  was finalized in March 2012.  The directory was  officially launched in April 2014. During the transition to the new   Directory, IMED and the Avicenna Directory remained open for a year, closing in 2015.  The major sponsors are the Australian Medical Council, Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates, Medical Council of Canada.
