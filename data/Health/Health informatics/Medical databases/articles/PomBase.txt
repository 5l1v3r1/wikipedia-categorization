PomBase is a model organism database that provides online access to the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe genome sequence and its features, together with a wide range of associated biological data and references to supporting literature.  PomBase provides genome-wide datasets and gene-specific annotation. Genome-wide datasets (including protein datasets, all annotations, manually curated ortholog lists etc) can be accessed from the datasets page. A genome browser (JBrowse instance) displays high-throughput datasets in the context of the genome sequence.  Gene annotation can be viewed either at a gene-specific level (on the gene pages) or at a term-specific level (on the ontology term pages). This makes it possible to either:  PomBase uses several biological ontologies to capture gene-specific information, including: The GO slim page provides an overview of the biological role of all fission yeast genes. PomBase also maintains a list of priority genes - these are genes with orthologs in vertebrates, but where the biological role of the gene is unknown in any species, making them especially of interest for functional characterization. To supplement the work of the small team of professional PomBase curators, fission yeast researchers contribute annotations directly to PomBase via an innovative community curation scheme, for which an online curation tool, Canto,   has been developed. Pombase provides both documentation and an FAQ. Usage of PomBase as a research tool is explored in the "Eukaryotic Genomic Databases" (Methods and Protocols) book chapter  . Developments and updates are described in the NAR Database Issue papers   . For a detailed overview of using S. pombe as a model organism see the genetics primer
