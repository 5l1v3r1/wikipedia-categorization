In epidemiology, the relative risk reduction (RRR) or efficacy is the relative decrease in the risk of an adverse event in the exposed group compared to an unexposed group. It is computed as                         (                    I                        u                             −                    I                        e                             )                    /                             I                        u                                     {\displaystyle (I_{u}-I_{e})/I_{u}}    , where                                    I                        e                                     {\displaystyle I_{e}}    is the incidence in the exposed group, and                                    I                        u                                     {\displaystyle I_{u}}    is the incidence in the unexposed group. If the risk of an adverse event is increased by the exposure rather then decreased, term relative risk increase (RRI) is used, and computed as                         (                    I                        e                             −                    I                        u                             )                    /                             I                        u                                     {\displaystyle (I_{e}-I_{u})/I_{u}}    .   If the direction of risk change is not assumed, a term relative effect is used and computed as                         (                    I                        e                             −                    I                        u                             )                    /                             I                        u                                     {\displaystyle (I_{e}-I_{u})/I_{u}}    .
