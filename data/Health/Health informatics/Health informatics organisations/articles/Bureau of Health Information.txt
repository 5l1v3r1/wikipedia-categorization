  The Bureau of Health Information is an independent, board-governed statutory authority responsible for reporting on the performance of the health system in New South Wales, Australia. It produces regular reports on health system accessibility, appropriateness, effectiveness, efficiency, equity and sustainability.   The reports are used to inform efforts to improve patient care and strengthen healthcare policy in NSW.  The Bureau was established in September 2009 by the NSW Government under the Health Services Act 1997 following the “Final Report of the Special Commission of Inquiry into Acute Care Services in NSW Public Hospitals”  by Peter Garling, SC, which recommended that: "a Bureau of Health Information be established to access, interpret and report on all data relating to safety and quality of patient care and facilitate its interpretation and re-issue to the unit level on a regular basis."
