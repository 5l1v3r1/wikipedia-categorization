The Client Access to Integrated Services and Information (CAISI) project aims to reduce the plight of chronic homelessness by enhancing the integration of care between agencies at the individual and population levels using an electronic information system.  As such, the project goals can be summarized as: The project builds on Seaton House - St. Michael's Hospital SHIFE experience, the Toronto District Health Council Discharge planning Toolkit, and the Homeless Health Reference Group. The CAISI project received funding approval in 2004, and officially began operations on April 1, 2005.
