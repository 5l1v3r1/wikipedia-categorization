CloudVisit Telemedicine is a software platform designed for physician use.  It allows healthcare providers the ability to schedule and conduct online appointments with patients using a webcam and microphone for live video chat sessions.  The telemedicine platform is available in two formats: CloudVisit Connect and CloudVisit Private Practice.  Both formats are HIPAA-compliant making them viable for physician-patient connectivity under guidelines as set for by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).  The software emphasizes patient and provider security.  Development of CloudVisit Telemedicine began in early 2010 by Aurora Information Technology, Inc., DBA CloudVisit. In mid-2011 a beta version of CloudVisit Psychiatry was launched, offering subscription-based services for psychiatrists and psychologist to conduct telepsychiatry sessions. The full version of CloudVisit Psychiatry was launched in 2012.  In 2013 the company launched CloudVisit Connect, a simplified pay-as-you-go version of the telemedicine platform.
