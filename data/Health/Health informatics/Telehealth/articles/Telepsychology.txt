Telepsychology is the use of telehealth within the practice of psychotherapy, wherein a medical professional uses online tools to assist patients.   Some tools may include, but are not limited to: Skype, email, online chatting, Oovoo, text-messaging, phone call, or using an app for the smart phone. Not only is telepsychology cost-effective, it also helps connect medical professionals to underserved patients while being more comforting and convenient to both parties.  There are guidelines and standards that must be met for a medical professional to successfully and effectively utilize their tools to aid their patients. ACPRO also has a model of standards for how one can conduct an adequate telepsychology service delivery.  Though it is understandable that critics will argue that telepsychology practices are not as effective as in-person practices, but there's enough evidence to suggest otherwise. One notable study conducted by APA Psych Net shows that there are no significant differences between telepsychology and in-person practices.  Telepsychiatry
