A digital pill is a pharmaceutical dosage form that contains an ingestible sensor inside of a pill.   The sensor begins transmitting medical data after it is consumed. The technology that makes up the pill, as well as the data transmitted by the pill's sensor, are considered to be part of digital medicine.  The purpose of the sensor is to determine whether the person is taking their medication or not (called "adherence").  There are privacy concerns with respect to who receives the data and what is done with it.   The first digital pill to be approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, a version of aripiprazole (Abilify) manufactured by Otsuka Pharmaceutical, was approved in November 2017.    This digital pill's sensor, developed by Proteus Digital Health, is activated by acid in the stomach, and generates an electrical signal that is picked up by a patch worn on the ribcage; the patch in turn forwards information to a smartphone app.  The drug is taken by people with schizophrenia.  People with the condition tend to have problems with adherence, and the digital pill could help with that; however some people with schizophernia have paranoia which the digital pill could make worse.
