Mirth Connect also known as Nextgen Connect is a cross-platform HL7 interface engine that enables bi-directional sending of HL7 messages between systems and applications over multiple transports available under the Mozilla Public License (MPL) 1.1 license. On September 9th, 2013 Mirth Corporation announced they were acquired by Quality Systems. . MirthConnect has since been rebranded as NextgenConnect  . Mirth Connect uses a channel-based architecture to connect HIT systems and allow messages to be filtered, transformed, and routed based on user-defined rules. Channels consist of connectors (both inbound and outbound), filters, and transformers. Multiple filters and a chain of transformers can be associated with a channel. Endpoints are used to configure connections and their protocol details. Source connectors are used to designate the type of listener to use for incoming messages, such as TCP/IP or a web service. Destination connectors are used to designate the destination of outgoing messages, such as an application server, a JMS queue, or a database. All messages and transactions are optionally logged to an internal database. Mirth Connect can be also configured to auto-generate an HL7 acknowledgement response (ACK).  Mirth Connect supports sending and receiving healthcare messages over a variety of protocols:  An open architecture allows for the easy addition of custom and legacy interfaces. The Certification Commission for Healthcare Information Technology (CCHIT), in a push to ensure interoperability standards between electronic health records, has adopted Laika, an open source standards software program. At the 2009 Annual HIMSS Conference, Mirth was selected as one of the testing tools for the coming interoperability tests.
