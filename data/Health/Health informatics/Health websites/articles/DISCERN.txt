DISCERN is an online instrument designed to measure the quality of health information on the Internet. It was originally developed by Deborah Charnock, Sasha Shepperd, Gill Needham, and Robert Gann, who reported on its development and validation in a February 1999 paper.  The DISCERN website was launched in May 1999. Despite originally being developed using printed materials, it has also been shown to be effective at evaluating the quality of online medical information, as well as for printed information.
