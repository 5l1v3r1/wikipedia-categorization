Healthdirect Australia is a national public health information service in Australia.   Originally known as the National Health Call Centre Network, Healthdirect Australia offers access to free health helplines  as well as online health information and advice.  In February 2006, the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) signed a Heads of Agreement to establish the National Health Call Centre Network (NHCCN).    The NHCCN commenced delivering services in July 2007, with its core service operating under a single national name, healthdirect Australia, and national phone number - 1800 022 222. In December 2012, the NHCCN changed its trading name to Healthdirect Australia, reflecting the organisation’s evolution from procuring and managing telephone triage services  to offering multiple services with integrated telephone and online channels. This was followed in November 2015 by the change of the registered name to Healthdirect Australia Limited. After a review of after-hours primary health care in July 2015, Healthdirect Australia began to operate locally tailored after-hours services and new GP advice and support lines.  Healthdirect Australia's services include a helpline available 24 hours a day,   an after-hours general practitioner (GP) helpline,    the healthdirect website (which provides free health information),      an app for mobile devices,   and a symptom checker (a guided, online self-triage tool allowing visitors to initiate their health enquiry online).   The Pregnancy, Birth and Baby  service includes a telephone helpline and a website, providing support to families of children aged up to 5 years.   The My Aged Care Gateway combines a telephone service and a website that both help consumers and service providers navigate and understand Australia’s aged care system.  Healthdirect services also include the National Health Services Directory (NHSD)     and the  Carer Gateway  for carers to access information and support by phone and online.
