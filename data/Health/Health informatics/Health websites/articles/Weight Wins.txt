Weight Wins is a UK weight loss business which has developed and commercialised the concept of personal contracts for weight loss. The company has attracted attention from UK and international media for its ‘Pounds for Pounds’ weight loss programme and for operating the first trial by the UK’s National Health Service (NHS) of a weight loss incentive programme.       The diet rewards sector addresses the specific problem of overweight and obesity. As with many commercial diet plans, there is no good evidence it is helpful or cost-effective.  Weight Wins' was first devised in 2007 following a UK-wide consumer survey.  The initial scheme was developed and trialled as the ‘Pounds for Pounds’ programme over a three-month period from September to December 2007, with a maximum weight loss target of 15 lbs.
