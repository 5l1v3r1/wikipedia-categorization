The Indices of Deprivation 2010 (ID 2010) is a deprivation index at the small area level, created by the British Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) and released on 24 March 2011. It follows the ID2007 and because much of the datasets are the same or similar between indices allows a comparison of "relative deprivation" of an area between the two indices.  While it is known as the ID2010, most of the data actually dates from 2008. According to the research, the most deprived area in the country is in the village of Jaywick on the Essex coast.
