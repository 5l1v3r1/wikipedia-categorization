 Abortions are conducted in all 50 states, but abortions are more common in some states than they are in others. The Guttmacher Institute did a study that shows which 25 states have the most abortions.  States vary widely in terms of overall population, so the total abortions are presented in terms of abortions per 1000 women between the ages of 15 and 45. This list includes totals from 25 states in 2008 and includes states that did not send data to the Center for Disease Control that year. For example, California and Florida had a combined total of 308,550 abortions in 2008  and did not send a report to the CDC that year. Delaware has the most abortions per 1000 women(15-44) at 40.  Tennessee had the 25th most with 15.5 per 1000 women(15-44).  The median number value is 19.2 abortions per 1000 women (15-44)  and corresponds with Kansas at 13th highest. The mean value for the top 25 states with the highest abortions in 2008 is 23.31 abortions per 1000 women (15-44).  The total abortions conducted in 2008 in these 25 states with the most abortions is over 1 million. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began abortion surveillance reports in 1969 to document the number and characteristics of women obtaining legal induced abortions. Many states conduct abortion surveillance. CDC compiles the information that states collect to produce national estimates. CDCâ€™s surveillance system compiles information on legal induced abortions only. Between 1970 and 2014, CDC reports nearly 44.5 million legal induced abortions. Note that there is a large decrease in reported abortions between 1997 and 1998.  This is because CDC's reporting areas were reduced from 52 in 1997 to 47 in 1998.  The actual decline from 1997 to 1998 in those 47 reporting areas was only 2%.  Note: Not all states reported for each year. See citation for list of states not reporting.
