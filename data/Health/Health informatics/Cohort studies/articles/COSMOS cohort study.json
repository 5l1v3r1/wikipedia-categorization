There are currently more than six billion users of mobile phones worldwide and in the UK there are over 70 million mobile phone devices in use. It is important for current users, and for future generations, to find out whether there are any possible long-term health effects from this new and widespread technology.\n</p><p>Many reviews have concluded that there is no convincing evidence to date that mobile phones are harmful to health. However, the widespread use of mobile phones is a relatively recent phenomenon and it is possible that adverse health effects could emerge after years of prolonged use. Evidence to date suggests that short term (less than ten years) exposure to mobile phone emissions is not associated with an increase in brain and nervous system cancers. However, regarding longer term use, the evidence base necessary to allow firm judgments to be made has not yet been accumulated. There are still significant uncertainties that can only be resolved by monitoring the health of a large cohort of phone users over a long period of time.\n</p><p>A major report on mobile phones and health was published by the UK Independent Expert Group on Mobile Phones in 2000, known as the 'Stewart report \u2019.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> This report was updated by a further review of mobile phones and health undertaken by the Advisory Group on Non-Ionizing Radiation (AGNIR )<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> and published by the <a href=\"/wiki/National_Radiological_Protection_Board\" title=\"National Radiological Protection Board\">National Radiological Protection Board</a> (NRPB) in 2005. Most recently, the independent Mobile Telecommunications and Health Research programme (MTHR), established in 2001 following the \u2018Stewart Report\u2019, published a report<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>  describing research undertaken as part of its programme. \n</p><p>None of the research supported by the MTHR programme and published so far demonstrates that biological or adverse health effects are produced by radiofrequency exposure from mobile phones. The report also summarizes the current evidence base regarding mobile phones and health and identifies priorities for future research. \n</p><p>The COSMOS study aims to carry out long term health monitoring of a large group of people to identify if there are any health issues linked to long term mobile phone use. Through this health monitoring, current uncertainties about possible long term health effects associated with this new technology can be resolved.  This research has been endorsed as a priority by agencies worldwide, including the <a href=\"/wiki/Department_of_Health_(United_Kingdom)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Department of Health (United Kingdom)\">Department of Health (United Kingdom)</a>, the UK <a href=\"/wiki/Health_Protection_Agency\" title=\"Health Protection Agency\">Health Protection Agency</a> (HPA), the UK Advisory Group on Non-Ionising Radiation (AGNIR), the European Union\u2019s <a href=\"/wiki/Scientific_Committee_on_Emerging_and_Newly_Identified_Health_Risks\" title=\"Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks\">Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks</a> (SCENHIR), and the <a href=\"/wiki/World_Health_Organisation\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"World Health Organisation\">World Health Organisation</a> (WHO).\n</p><p>Following the publication of the Stewart report by the Independent Expert Group on Mobile Phones in 2000, an independent research programme, called the Mobile Telecommunications and Health Research Programme (MTHR), was set up in the UK to look into the possible health impact of Mobile Telecommunications. The most recent report from the MTHR concluded that:\n</p><p><i>\u201c...short term (less than ten years) exposure to mobile phone emissions is not associated with an increase in brain and nervous system cancers. However, there are still significant uncertainties that can only be resolved by monitoring the health of a large cohort of phone users over a long period of time.\u201d</i>\n</p><p><i>\u201cThe Committee is convinced that the best way to address these uncertainties is to carry out a large cohort study of mobile phone users, an approach that has also been rated as a high priority by the World Health Organisation.\u201d</i>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Funding\">Funding</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a
