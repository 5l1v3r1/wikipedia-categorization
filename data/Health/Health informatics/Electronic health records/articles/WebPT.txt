WebPT is a Phoenix, Arizona-based company that provides web-based electronic medical record (EMR) systems for physical therapists.   In addition to its patient documentation software, WebPT offers systems for billing, scheduling, and practice management.  As of February 2015, more than 43,000 rehabilitation professionals in over 7,000 clinics used WebPTâ€™s system.  WebPT was named to the Inc. 500 list of the "fastest-growing private U.S. companies" in 2013 and 2014.  From 2011 to 2013, the company was named one of the "Best Places to Work in the Valley" by the Phoenix Business Journal.    In October 2014, the company reported a three-year growth rate of 1,316 percent, making it the fastest-growing company in Phoenix.  WebPT was founded in 2008 by Heidi Jannenga and her ex-husband, Brad Jannenga.  Heidi had a physical therapy practice, which helped spark the idea for the software.  Brad was once president and CTO and now Heidi is the president after Battery Ventures voted to remove Brad from his executive role. Nancy Ham is CEO.  In 2010, the startup received a $1 million funding round from Canal Partners, led by Jim Armstrong.  WebPT received an undisclosed investment in June 2014 from venture capital firm Battery Ventures.  To expand its billing system, WebPT acquired Health Data Solutions in 2012, a revenue cycle management business that provided billing services primarily to physical therapists and chiropractors.   WebPT acquired WebOutcomes, an online outcomes tracking tool offering evidence-based tests that physical and occupational therapists use to collect objective patient data, in November 2014.  In 2013, WebPT launched the WebPT Marketplace, an e-commerce site with the goal of selling clinical supplies to WebPT customers at reduced rates.  The company announced a partnership with SOLS, a manufacturer of 3D-printed foot orthotics, in February 2015.
