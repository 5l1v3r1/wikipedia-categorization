 SleepBot is a mobile app and Web application.  SleepBot includes a "smart alarm" feature, debt estimation, sleep tracking, and other features. The mobile version works with Android and iOS smartphones and tablets; the Web version works on any modern computer. SleepBot is still available at no charge. A member of the development team has written that SleepBot development has ceased.   This means that, in all likelihood, no new features will ever be added, and most of SleepBot's software bugs will never be fixed.  No new SleepBot releases were made in 2014 or 2015. A bug-fix release, SleepBot 1.3 for iOS, was released in April 2016, in order to improve SleepBot's compatibility with iOS 9.3.  SleepBot has problems on Android 6.0 "Marshmallow" and above, but a simple workaround exists; see below. SleepBot includes two main features: debt estimation and "smart alarms". SleepBot also includes a variety of minor features, including sound recording, motion graphing, gentle alarms, sleep trend graphs, bedtime reminders, and others. The Google Play digital distribution platform allows consumers to submit app reviews and ratings.  The reviewers there are mostly grateful for SleepBot's features, but a fair number do complain about significant unresolved software bugs.  Some of the Google Play reviewers complain about problems with SleepBot's smart alarms ringing on time, or about problems with SleepBot's snooze function. It appears that these problems are related to the "Doze" feature included in Android 6.0 "Marshmallow" and later Android versions. The workaround for SleepBot's alarm problems is to exempt SleepBot from "Doze" mode.  In June 2011, SleepBot LLC was formed by Edison Wang and Jane Zhu, and Daniel Amitay. This was a limited liability company registered in Delaware. In October 2013, the company was granted "foreign" (out-of-state) company status in New York state, so that it could conduct business there as well. Competitors include:
