 Health (or HealthKit) is the health informatics mobile app announced by Apple Inc. at its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in 2014. The app is included with iOS 8 or later.  HealthKit is the accompanying developer application programming interface (API) included in the iOS SDK (Software Development Kit) for the Mac. It is used by software developers to design applications that have extensibility and that can interact with the health application on iOS.  After the release of iOS 8 in September 2014, Apple removed all HealthKit-compatible apps from its App Store to fix a bug causing  cellular and Touch ID issues, and then re-released Healthkit, with the release of iOS 8.0.2, on September 26, 2014.    Initially, Health was criticized for its lack of compatible third-party applications (at launch), glucose tracking, proper health data explanations, and sluggish app performance.   Eventually, Apple fixed these issues with a software update.  As of February 2017, several manufacturers other than Apple sold hardware that was HealthKit enabled.  As of July 2016, iOS 10 users in the United States were able to sign up to be an organ, eye, and tissue donor in the Apple Health app.
