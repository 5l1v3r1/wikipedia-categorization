 Google Fit is a health-tracking platform developed by Google for the Android operating system and Wear OS. It is a single set of APIs that blends data from multiple apps and devices.  Google Fit uses sensors in a user's activity tracker or mobile device to record physical fitness activities (such as walking or cycling), which are measured against the user's fitness goals to provide a comprehensive view of their fitness. Google Fit was announced at the Google I/O conference on June 25, 2014. A software development kit for Google Fit was released on August 7, 2014.  Fit launched to the public on October 28, 2014. In August 2018, Google announced a revamp to its Android Fit platform which adds activity goals based on activity recommendations from the American Heart Association and the World Health Organization.   The updates are meant to help Fit better provide metrics for activities other than walking, and encourage users to engage in activities that will raise the heart rate without necessarily requiring a trip to the gym.  Google Fit provides a single set of APIs for apps and device manufacturers to store and access activity data from fitness apps and sensors on Android and other devices (like wearables, heart rate monitors or connected scales). Users can choose who their fitness data is shared with as well as delete this information at any time.
