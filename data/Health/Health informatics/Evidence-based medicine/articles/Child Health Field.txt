The Child Health Field (properly termed the Cochrane Child Health Field) is an entity under the broader Cochrane Collaboration.  The Cochrane Collaboration is a not-for-profit international organisation devoted to the promotion of evidence concerning health care interventions.  This evidence is primarily disseminated through systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials that are published in the Cochrane Library.  The role of fields within the collaboration is to facilitate the production of reviews within their areas of focus, to disseminate findings of reviews pertaining to that area of focus,  and to liaise between the entities of the Cochrane Collaboration and the "field's specialist area of health care."  In this role the Child Health Field is actively involved in the facilitation of systematic reviews, in the dissemination of child health evidence, and acts as an advocate for the concerns of child health in the production of child relevant systematic reviews. The Child Health Field produces one publication, the journal titled Evidence-Based Child Health, that is published by John Wiley & Sons.  Wiley also publishes the Cochrane Library.  This publication is solely concerned with disseminating the evidence of child relevant Cochrane systematic reviews. Each issue contains commentaries and evidence summaries on recently published reviews, a methods column concerning the production of a review, as well as one primary research effort per issue called an overview of reviews. The Child Health Field also produces a column called "Evidence for Clinicians" that is published in Paediatrics & Child Health.   Paediatrics & Child Health is the official journal of the Canadian Paediatric Society.
