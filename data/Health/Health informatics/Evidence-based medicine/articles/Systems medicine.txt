Systems medicine is an interdisciplinary field of study that looks at the systems of the human body as part of an integrated whole, incorporating biochemical, physiological, and environment interactions. Systems medicine draws on systems science and systems biology, and considers complex interactions within the human body in light of a patient's genomics, behavior and environment.  The earliest uses of the term systems medicine appeared in 1992, in an article on systems medicine and pharmacology by B.J. Zeng   and in a paper on systems biomedicine by T. Kamada.  An important topic in systems medicine and systems biomedicine is the development of computational models that  describe disease progression and the effect of therapeutic interventions.      More recent approaches include the redefinition of disease phenotypes based on common mechanisms rather than symptoms. These provide then therapeutic targets including network pharmacology  and drug repurposing . Since 2018, there is a dedicated scientific journal, Systems Medicine, published by Marie-Ann Liebert and with Jan Baumbach and Harald Schmidt as co-editors in chief.
