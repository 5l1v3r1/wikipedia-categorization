Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine is a peer-reviewed open-access medical journal covering alternative medicine published by Hindawi Publishing Corporation. The journal was established in 2004 by Edwin L. Cooper, who also served as its editor-in-chief until 2010, when the journal moved from Oxford University Press to Hindawi.  Initially, the journal was entirely open access, without publication charge to the authors except for color figures, but Oxford University Press changed its policy in 2008 and made reviews, editorials, and commentaries subscription-based, while maintaining open access for original research papers.  Hindawi returned the journal to a full open access model, but authors have to pay an article processing charge.  According to the Journal Citation Reports, the journal has a 2015 impact factor of 1.931.  One of the founding editors, Professor Edzard Ernst, has described the journal as "useless rubbish", primarily due to ineffective peer review.
