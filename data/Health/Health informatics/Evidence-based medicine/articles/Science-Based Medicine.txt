Science-Based Medicine is a website with articles covering issues in science and medicine,   especially dangerous medical scams and practices.  Science-Based Medicine is noted as an influential and respected source of information about medical controversies and alternative medicine.      Steven Novella, a clinical neurologist at Yale University, founded the site as a blog and serves as its executive editor.   David Gorski, a surgical oncologist at Wayne State University, serves as the managing editor.    Both editors and the blog's regular contributors are prominent skeptics, doctors, researchers, and communicators.  The Science-Based Medicine editorial staff describes themselves as "being alarmed at the manner in which unscientific and pseudoscientific health care ideas have increasingly infiltrated academic medicine and medicine at large"; they state that the best medicine is based on scientific principles, which includes prior plausibility, not based on evidence alone.
