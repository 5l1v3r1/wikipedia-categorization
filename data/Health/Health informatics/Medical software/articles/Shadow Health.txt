Shadow Health is an educational software developer of learning environments termed Digital Clinical Experiences™ (DCEs). Founded in Gainesville, Florida in 2011, Shadow Health offers web-based clinical learning environments for masters, bachelors, and associate degree students and faculty in the fields of nursing and healthcare. The Shadow Health DCE is used in universities across the United States and Canada. As a learning management system, each DCE provides educators with administration, documentation and tracking functions to measure student clinical competence and clinical reasoning. Students navigate the digital clinical experience gaining confidence, developing clinical skills and learning how to effectively interact with patients within a safe environment. Through the Shadow Health DCE, students engage with Digital Standardized Patients™ to perform patient exams, practice documentation and develop clinical reasoning skills. Upon completion of each virtual patient examination, students are prompted to reflect on their experiences and compare them against an expert’s notes. Shadow Health's premier DSP is Tina Jones. According to a health educator at Drexel University, "what truly makes Shadow Health unique, however, is that Tina acts like a real patient by responding to how she is treated, approached or the type of questions she is asked by the student practitioner"   The Shadow Health work environment includes cross-functional teams using agile management. Shadow Health is a graduate of The Innovation Hub, a local incubator hub opened in 2011. "Hub tenants have created more than 760 jobs and drawn more than $50 million in private investment funds"   Having been named as one of the 2014 Florida Companies to watch,  Shadow Health continues to expand with moves to larger office spaces in both 2012  and again December 2015.
