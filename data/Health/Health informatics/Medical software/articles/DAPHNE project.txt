The DAPHNE Project is an R&D project led by Treelogic SL and part-funded by the European Union 7th Framework Programme  for information and communication technology research. The project is listed in the European Commission CORDIS project listings. Initial EU funding is for the period 2013-2016. DAPHNE is an acronym for ‘DAta-as-a-service Platform for Healthy lifestyle and preventive mediciNE’ with the objective to develop and test methods for utilising personal activity and fitness information. The project aims to develop data analysis platforms for collecting, analysing and delivering information on physical fitness and behaviour. Standardised data platforms are being designed to help hardware and software developers to provide personalised health information to individuals and to their health service providers.  Project outputs will include (i) advanced sensors which can link directly to mobile phones to acquire and store data on lifestyle, behaviour and the surrounding environment; (ii) intelligent data processing for the recognition of behaviour patterns and trends; (iii) software platforms for linking individual health data to health service providers for personalised guidance on healthy lifestyle and disease prevention and to contribute to Big Data services.
