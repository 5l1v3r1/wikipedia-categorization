For ten years, INTERNIST-I was the centerpiece of a Pittsburgh course entitled \u201cThe Logic of Problem-Solving in Clinical Diagnosis.\u201d In consultation with faculty experts, much responsibility for data entry and updating of the system fell to the fourth-year medical students enrolled in the course. These students encoded the findings of standard clinicopathological reports. By 1982, the INTERNIST-I project represented fifteen person-years of work, and by some reports covered 70-80% of all the possible diagnoses in <a href=\"/wiki/Internal_medicine\" title=\"Internal medicine\">internal medicine</a>.\n</p><p>Data input into the system by operators included signs and symptoms, laboratory results, and other items of patient history. The principal investigators on INTERNIST-I did not follow other medical expert systems designers in adopting <a href=\"/wiki/Bayesian_statistics\" title=\"Bayesian statistics\">Bayesian</a> statistical models or <a href=\"/wiki/Pattern_recognition\" title=\"Pattern recognition\">pattern recognition</a>. This was because, as Myers explained, \u201cThe method used by physicians to arrive at diagnoses requires complex information processing which bears little resemblance to the statistical manipulations of most computer-based systems.\u201d INTERNIST-I instead used a powerful ranking algorithm to reach diagnoses in the domain of internal medicine. The heuristic rules that drove INTERNIST-I relied on a partitioning algorithm to create problems areas, and exclusion functions to eliminate diagnostic possibilities.\n</p><p>These rules, in turn, produce a list of ranked diagnoses based on disease profiles existing in the system\u2019s memory. When the system was unable to make a determination of diagnosis it asked questions or offered recommendations for further tests or observations to clear up the mystery. INTERNIST-I worked best when only a single disease was expressed in the patient, but handled complex cases poorly, where more than one disease was present. This was because the system exclusively relied on hierarchical or taxonomic decision-tree logic, which linked each disease profile to only one \u201cparent\u201d disease class.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Use_of_INTERNIST-I\">Use of INTERNIST-I</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Internist-I&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Use of INTERNIST-I\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>By the late 1970s, INTERNIST-I was in experimental use as a consultant program and educational \u201cquizmaster\u201d at Presbyterian-University Hospital in Pittsburgh. INTERNIST-I\u2019s designers hoped that the system could one day become useful in remote environments\u2014rural areas, outer space, and foreign military bases, for instance\u2014where experts were in short supply or unavailable. Still, physicians and paramedics wanting to use INTERNIST-I found the training period lengthy and the interface unwieldy. An average consultation with INTERNIST-I required about thirty to ninety minutes, too long for most clinics. To meet this challenge, researchers at nearby <a href=\"/wiki/Carnegie_Mellon_University\" title=\"Carnegie Mellon University\">Carnegie Mellon University</a> wrote a program called ZOG that allowed those unfamiliar with the system to master it more rapidly. INTERNIST-I never moved beyond its original status as a research tool. In one instance, for example, a failed attempt to extract \u201csynthetic\u201d case studies of \u201cartificial patients\u201d from the system\u2019s knowledge base in the mid-1970s overtly demonstrated its \u201cshallowness\u201d in practice.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"INTERNIST-I_and_QMR\">INTERNIST-I and QMR</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Internist-I&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: INTERNIST-I and QMR\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In the first version of INTERNIST-I (completed in 1974) the computer program \u201ctreated the physician as unable to solve a diagnostic problem,\u201d or as a \u201cpassive observer\u201d who merely performed data entry.  Miller and his collaborators came to see this function as a liability in the 1980s, referring to INTERNIST-I derisively as an example of the outmoded \u201cGreek Oracle\u201d model for medical <a href=\"/wiki/Expert_systems\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Expert systems\">expert systems</a>.  In the mid-1980s INTERNIST-I was succeeded by a powerful microcomputer-based consultant developed at the University of Pittsburgh called <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Quick_Medical_Reference_(QMR)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Quick Medical Reference (QMR) (page does not exist)\">Quick Medical Reference (QMR)</a>. QMR, meant to rectify the technical and philosophical deficiencies of INTERNIST-I, still remained dependent on many of the same algorithms developed for INTERNIST-I, and the systems are often referred to together as INTERNIST-I/QMR.
