VOXEL-MAN is the name of a set of a computer programs for creation and visualization of three-dimensional digital models of the human body derived from cross-sectional images of Computer Tomography, Magnetic Resonance Tomography or photography (e. g. the Visible Human Project).   It was developed at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf.  Applications include digital anatomical atlases and surgery simulators.  The name is derived from the term Voxel, the elementary cuboid component of a digital representation of a three-dimensional object ( a "threedimensional pixel"). Occasionally the name Voxel-Man is also used as a general term for a digital representation of the human body.
