ITK-SNAP is an interactive software application that allows users to navigate three-dimensional medical images, manually delineate anatomical regions of interest, and perform automatic image segmentation. The software was designed with the audience of clinical and basic science researchers in mind, and emphasis has been placed on having a user-friendly interface and maintaining a limited feature set to prevent feature creep. ITK-SNAP is most frequently used to work with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) data sets. The purpose of the tool is to make it easy for researchers to delineate anatomical structures and regions of interest in imaging data. The set of features is kept to a minimum. The main features of the program are ITK-SNAP is open source software distributed under the GNU General Public License. It is written in C++ and it leverages the Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit (ITK) library. ITK-SNAP can read and write a variety of medical image formats, including DICOM, NIfTI, and Mayo Analyze. It also offers limited support for multi-component (e.g., diffusion tensor imaging) and multi-variate imaging data. ITK-SNAP has been applied in the following areas
