During his tour, he served both as the Anesthesiology Division Officer and the Public Affairs Officer in support of both Operation Enduring Freedom and Resolute Support Mission from September 2014 to April 2015. During his tour, he was constantly relied upon to care for wounded U.S. servicemembers and coalition forces, enabling the immediate life and limb saving treatment of numerous casualties who underwent emergency surgery in a far forward deployed location. The extraordinary care Ehrenfeld provided enabled at least three critically injured servicemembers to be stabilized and airlifted home. Without his presence, several of those who were injured would not have survived.  His fearless dedication and commitment to caring for others, even in the face of indirect fire, led to Ehrenfeld's receipt of several service medals from the U.S. Navy and Airforce. A longtime advocate for patients, equality, and LGBT health, Ehrenfeld made international headlines on February 22, 2015, when he asked the newly appointed Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter his stance on letting transgender individuals serve in the military. The Secretary's response "I don't think anything but their suitability for service should preclude them [from serving]"  â€” was his first public comment on the issue and the most favorable from a senior U.S. military official to date. Within hours, the event was being reported by news outlets all over the world and by the next afternoon the White House chimed in with its enthusiastic support, sparking even more media attention.     Ehrenfeld lives in Nashville, Tennessee, with his husband Judd Taback, an administrative judge, and their bulldog Maddie. He enjoys photography, running and traveling with his husband.
