Lark Technologies is an American technology company that specializes in chronic disease management and prevention through AI. Lark’s platform uses artificial intelligence (AI) and captures biometric data from a user’s smartphone and over 110 other personal devices to create an AI individualized health coaching partner.   Lark’s AI “Health Coach” processes data and feedback from users to set guidance to optimize sleep, diet, disease prevention, management of chronic conditions, exercise regimes, and medication adherence.    Co-founder and CEO Julia Hu grew up with a chronic disease which lead her to create solutions for people who are at risk of developing and living with chronic diseases.    Hu founded Lark Technologies in 2010.   Lark services have been built over five years of research and development into a platform containing wellness, diabetes prevention, diabetes management, hypertension management, and cholesterol management.    The Lark AI Health Coach incorporates elements of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and monitors user’s health through phone sensors and integrated health devices.   It mimics a nurse’s counseling through casual conversations using text communication and other interactive elements. Lark is the only AI-sourced Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) recognized by the Center for Disease Control, and the first AI DPP to be fully reimbursable with a Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code.   The application design and function is supervised by behavior change experts and health faculty from Harvard and Stanford universities, from which the company has also assembled a 15-member advisory healthcare committee.
