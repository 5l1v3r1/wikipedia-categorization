Caisis is an open source, web-based, patient data management system that integrates research with patient care. The system is freely distributed to promote the collection of standard, well structured data suitable for research and multi-institution collaboration. Caisis was designed around structured chronological patient histories which could be displayed to clinicians and processed by computer algorithms.  The system was initiated in the Department of Urology at Memorial Sloanâ€“Kettering Cancer Center in 2002 and has been actively developed by BioDigital Systems and a number of other institutions world-wide. It is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL) and is entirely web based; written mainly in C#, HTML, and JavaScript it runs on the .Net Framework. The installer, source code and documentation are available from its website. Although it is widely used in cancer research the framework allows rapid adoption for collecting data on a multitude of disease states. Caisis has been developed to allow the system to evolve and adapt to the evolving landscape of clinical research. As a framework, it is easy for developers to extend Caisis by adding new fields and tables, plugin features, and new modules with standalone functionality. New functionality is added to support the primary goal of Caisis: to capture the patient's clinical "story". This approach provides users and clinicians with work flow driven interfaces that allow data capture to occur at the point of service. Capturing data in the structured, Caisis relational data model, will facilitate the generation of large clean datasets for multi-institution collaborative research.
