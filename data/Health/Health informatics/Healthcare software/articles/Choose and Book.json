This enabled patients to either book their appointment at their GP practice, call the national appointments line (0845 60 88888) or book their appointment online through the <a href=\"/wiki/HealthSpace\" title=\"HealthSpace\">HealthSpace</a> website. <i>Directly Bookable Services</i> refers to hospitals using Choose and Book compliant PAS systems.

Interim solutions were devised in 2005/6 to allow patients to benefit from Choose and Book where systems were not compliant.\n</p>\n<ul><li><i>Web Based Referral</i> allowed a GP to access Choose and Book via a standard web browser until their Clinical Computing system can be successfully upgraded.</li>\n<li><i>Indirectly Bookable Services</i> involves telephone call handlers in hospitals to offer appointments to patients.

A 2006 survey (published 2008)<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> found that the majority of patients were not experiencing the degree of choice that the system was designed to deliver.\n</p><p>To increase the uptake of Choose &amp; Book by doctors in England, surgeries were offered a financial incentive for the first part of 2006, but it continued to suffer from adverse publicity in the medical press and resistance from a number of GPs.\n</p><p>As the application became more stable during 2005 and 2006, booking volumes increased, albeit more slowly than planned. At December 2006, over 1.5M patients had used Choose and Book. By the end of October 2008, this had risen to over 10M bookings, with daily figures of over 20,000. All <a href=\"/wiki/Primary_Care_Trust\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Primary Care Trust\">Primary Care Trusts</a> in England were live with Choose and Book (although that might only be one GP within a PCT or practice), while all NHS Acute Trusts and a large number of Independent Sector Hospitals used Choose and Book. At 28 October 2008, 93% of practices were providing the service, and while some PCTs are only seeing low volumes (30% and less in some cases), many were booking 70 to 80% of patients using Choose and Book.\n</p><p>Use reached a high point nationally of 57% of referrals in the first two months of 2010.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> As incentive schemes were scaled back there was a drop in use to 50% at the start of 2012.  When the system was turned off in June 2015 it was used by 40,000 patients every day.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Extended_Choice_Network\">Extended Choice Network</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Choose_and_Book&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Extended Choice Network\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In January 2007 private Hospitals started making their services directly bookable to GPs whose PCT had commissioned their services. From April 2007, the 'Extended Choice Network' included all <a href=\"/wiki/NHS_Foundation_Trust\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"NHS Foundation Trust\">NHS Foundation Trusts</a> and independent sector hospitals accredited by the <a href=\"/wiki/Department_of_Health_(United_Kingdom)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Department of Health (United Kingdom)\">Department of Health</a> as meeting NHS quality and cost criteria. This meant that a GP could, via CaB, offer their patients the choice of four or more local providers, and the option of any Foundation Trust or accredited independent sector hospital in England. The Government's intention was that when patients were able to choose between their local NHS Hospital and any accredited private hospital in England, standards would rise (known as 'contestability'). In March 2007 the first independent sector hospitals became available as directly bookable options from within Choose and Book.\n</p><p>From April 2008, 'Free Choice' policy meant that patients could choose from any clinically appropriate and accredited provider in England. Since the deployment of Release 4.0 of the application in May 2008, referrers could select from two menus: \"Search Primary Care\", which only showed services provided by the PCT or by smaller local providers, or \"Search All\", which showed services provided by all accredited providers in England. One criticism of this policy is that patients and their referring clinicians needed more meaningful information to make a genuinely informed choice, some of which is provided by the NHS website \"Find and Choose a Hospital\" comparison feature.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Choose_and_Book&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><cite class=\"citation news\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.computerworlduk.com/news/public-sector/3575309/nhs-delays-e-referral-service-launch-until-2015/\">\"NHS delays e-Referral service launch until 2015\"</a>.
