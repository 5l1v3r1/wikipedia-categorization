{"parse":{"title":"Great Plague of Seville","pageid":5473348,"revid":826035816,"text":{"*":"<div class=\"mw-parser-output\"><p>The <b>Great Plague of Seville</b> (1647\u20131652) was a massive outbreak of disease in <a href=\"/wiki/Spain\" title=\"Spain\">Spain</a> that killed up to a quarter of <a href=\"/wiki/Seville\" title=\"Seville\">Seville</a>'s population.\n</p><p>Unlike the plague of 1596\u20131602, which claimed 600,000 to 700,000 lives, or a little under 8% of the population and initially struck northern and central Spain and <a href=\"/wiki/Andalusia\" title=\"Andalusia\">Andalusia</a> in the south, the Great Plague, which may have arisen in Algeria, struck the Mediterranean side of Spain first.  The coastal city of <a href=\"/wiki/Valencia,_Spain\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Valencia, Spain\">Valencia</a> was the first city to be hit, losing an estimated 30,000 people. The disease raged through Andaluc\u00eda, in addition to sweeping the north into Catalonia and Aragon. The coast of <a href=\"/wiki/M%C3%A1laga\" title=\"M\u00e1laga\">M\u00e1laga</a> lost upwards of 50,000 people. In Seville, quarantine measures were evaded, ignored, unproposed and/or unenforced<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources. (September 2012)\">citation needed</span></a></i>&#93;</sup>.  Unsurprisingly, the result was horrific. The city of Seville and its rural districts were thought to have lost 150,000 people&#8212;starting with a total population of 600,000. Altogether Spain was thought to have lost 500,000 people, out of a population of slightly fewer than 10,000,000, or nearly 5% of its entire population. This was the greatest, but not the only, plague of 17th century Spain.\n</p><p>Not quite twenty-five years later, Spain found itself once again in the grips of a furious plague. For nine years (1676\u20131685), ebbing and flowing like a great wave, it ravaged all Spain. It struck with especial virulence in the areas of Andaluc\u00eda and Valencia. The poor harvest of 1682-83 brought with it famine conditions which weakened the exhausted population even further. This last plague of the 17th century, plus the famine that followed in its wake, is estimated to have taken an additional 250,000 lives.\n</p><p>Three great plagues ravaged Spain in the 17th century. They were:\n</p>\n<ul><li>The Plague of 1596\u20131602 (Arrived in Santander by ship from northern Europe, most likely the Netherlands, then spread south through the centre of Castile, reaching Madrid by 1599 and arriving in the southern city of Seville by 1600.)</li>\n<li>The Plague of 1646\u20131652 (\"The Great Plague of Seville\"; believed to have arrived by ship from Algeria, it was spread north by coastal shipping, afflicting towns and their hinterlands along the Mediterranean coast as far north as Barcelona.)</li>\n<li>The Plague of 1676\u20131685</li></ul>\n<p>Factoring in normal births, deaths, plus emigration, historians reckon the total cost in human lives due to these plagues throughout Spain, throughout the entire 17th century, to be a minimum of nearly 1.25 million. As a result, the population of Spain scarcely budged between the years 1596 and 1696.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>  \n</p><p>The disease is generally believed to have been <a href=\"/wiki/Bubonic_plague\" title=\"Bubonic plague\">bubonic plague</a>, an infection by the <a href=\"/wiki/Bacterium\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Bacterium\">bacterium</a> <i><a href=\"/wiki/Yersinia_pestis\" title=\"Yersinia pestis\">Yersinia pestis</a></i>, transmitted via a rat <a href=\"/wiki/Vector_(epidemiology)\" title=\"Vector (epidemiology)\">vector</a>.
