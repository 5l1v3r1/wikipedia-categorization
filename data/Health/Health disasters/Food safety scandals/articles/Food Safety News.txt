 Food Safety News is a news and campaigning website focusing on food safety.   It was founded in 2009 by Bill Marler, a lawyer and food safety advocate.  Marler is the Managing Partner of Marler Clark, a Seattle, Washington, law firm that specializes in foodborne illness cases.  He said that Food Safety News was created to "fill a void" left by print and broadcast media as budgetary constraints led to "dedicated reporters on the food, health and safety beats... being reassigned or seeing their positions disappear altogether."  The site provides daily news coverage of "foodborne illness outbreaks and investigations, food recalls, and how food safety fits into the local food movement."
