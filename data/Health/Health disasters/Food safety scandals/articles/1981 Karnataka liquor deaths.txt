Adulteration of cheap liquor by methyl alcohol resulted in deaths. Availability of cheap spurious alcohol, (known as hooch) is a problem around the Tannery Road area of the Bangalore Cantonment, with many dwellers getting addicted. Notorious bootlegger Marimuthu (who later became a councillor of BBMP) and Ameer Jan were running the racket. Hootch is brewed from industrial alcohol, by separating Methyl Alcohol, and adding water - A dangerous process which can leave traces of poisonous Methyl Alcohol. The brew is slow poison, damaging kidney and intestines, leading to slow death. On 7 July 1981, about 300 people (Official figures 229) around the Tannery Road area died as a result of consuming this spurious alcohol. Most of the victims were poor Dalits. Police registered cases against 63 people, but none were convicted or punished. An enquiry commission revealed a connection between some politicians and the bootleggers. A paltry sum of INR 1000 per family was paid to the victims by the Gundu Rao government.
