 On June 17, 2015, a number of people fell ill after drinking contaminated alcohol in the Laxmi Nagar slum in Malad, located in Mumbai, India.  As of June 20, at least 90 people had died as a result of drinking this alcohol.   Another 31 people were hospitalised as a result of the incident.  The incident has been described as the worst of its kind in over a decade.   Alcohol poisoning incidents are common in India, where poor people often cannot afford licensed liquor. In 2004, 104 people died after drinking contaminated alcohol in the Mumbai neighbourhood of Vikhroli.  By 22 June, 2015, seven people have been arrested, and eight police officers have also been suspended for negligence, in connection with the incident. The people who were arrested are believed to have transported the liquor to workers. The prime suspect, Mainka Bai, a woman, was absconding as of 22 June 2015. The arrested included two women: Mamta Rathod (aged 30) and Agnes Gracy alias Aunty (aged 50).    According to police, the victims suffered methanol poisoning from methanol that had been added to the liquor to increase its potency.  The government of India has announced that it will compensate the families of the victims of the incident with 100,000 rupees, the equivalent of $1,575 in US dollars.
