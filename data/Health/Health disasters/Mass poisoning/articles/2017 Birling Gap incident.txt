  On 27 August 2017, Beachy Head and beaches including Birling Gap, in the English county of East Sussex were evacuated following a suspected chemical leak. Visitors reported ill effects after the appearance of a "mist", and  233 people were treated at Eastbourne General Hospital, initially with a full chemical decontamination.   Witnesses reported that no matter how many times they washed their eyes, they were stinging and drying up regardless.  Whilst it was unclear what the gas actually was, chlorine was blamed initially. East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service stated that "due to the symptoms and situation described", the gas was unlikely to be chlorine.  Previous chemical emission clouds have drifted across from industrial units in Northern France, however, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) have stated that in this incident such a scenario was unlikely due to weather models.  The MCA said that one line of investigation was a possible leak from a disturbed shipwreck, with the SS Mira, a 3,700-tonne First World War armed tanker sunk by a German mine on 11 October 1917, suggested as one potential source. Investigators from the MCA were also looking at some 180 ships that passed through the area on 27 August 2017.  In 2018 BBC Sussex requested police fire ard ambulance logs under a freedom of information request.  The National Police Air Service and Ministry of Defence were asked to help but said their aircraft could not fly in the circumstances.  Helicopters could not be used to investigate the haze as it wasn't known if the gas was explosive.  East Sussex Fire Service used gas detection equipment, but could not detect anything as the cloud had dispersed.  Caroline Lucas, the Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion called for an urgent inquiry to determine the cause."
