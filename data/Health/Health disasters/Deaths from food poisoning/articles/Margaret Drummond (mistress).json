As a general rule, claims of poisoning made in relation to a historical figure who died after a sudden illness should be treated with caution, but in this case, with three people who presumably died shortly after eating the same meal, the contemporary judgement should be accepted.  The three sisters are buried together in <a href=\"/wiki/Dunblane_Cathedral\" title=\"Dunblane Cathedral\">Dunblane Cathedral</a>, their graves can still be seen in front of the altar.  This did not cause a great deal of suspicion at the time; standards of food hygiene are unlikely to have been very good then, and cases of accidental food poisoning have happened in any period.\n</p><p>After her death the king paid for <a href=\"/wiki/Mass_(liturgy)\" title=\"Mass (liturgy)\">masses</a> to be said for her soul, and continued to support their daughter.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Murder_theories\">Murder theories</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Margaret_Drummond_(mistress)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Murder theories\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>It has been widely suggested in more recent years that Margaret Drummond was murdered, either by <a href=\"/wiki/Kingdom_of_England\" title=\"Kingdom of England\">English</a> agents or by pro-English elements in the <a href=\"/wiki/Kingdom_of_Scotland\" title=\"Kingdom of Scotland\">Scottish</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Nobility\" title=\"Nobility\">nobility</a>.  Many believe that James IV was planning to or had already secretly married Drummond, and her death was necessary in order to allow or force the King to marry the English princess <a href=\"/wiki/Margaret_Tudor\" title=\"Margaret Tudor\">Margaret Tudor</a>, daughter of <a href=\"/wiki/Henry_VII_of_England\" title=\"Henry VII of England\">Henry VII of England</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Elizabeth_of_York\" title=\"Elizabeth of York\">Elizabeth of York</a>.  The (comparatively recent) plaque on her grave in Dunblane Cathedral claims that she was commonly believed to be \"privately married\" to the king, and that she was murdered by Scottish nobles who supported the English marriage.\n</p><p>Furthermore, the \"Marriage of the Rose and Thistle\", as the poet <a href=\"/wiki/William_Dunbar\" title=\"William Dunbar\">William Dunbar</a> described it, brought about the <a href=\"/wiki/Union_of_the_Crowns\" title=\"Union of the Crowns\">Union of the Crowns</a> exactly 100 years later, as it enabled their great-grandson <a href=\"/wiki/James_VI_and_I\" title=\"James VI and I\">James VI of Scotland</a> to claim the English throne upon the death of <a href=\"/wiki/Elizabeth_I_of_England\" title=\"Elizabeth I of England\">Elizabeth I</a> through his descent from Henry VII.\n</p><p>Had James IV married Margaret Drummond instead of Margaret Tudor, the Union of the Crowns might never have taken place and Scotland might have remained an independent country. This idea has been the theme of numerous historical novels and popular histories.\n</p><p>Serious historians are skeptical of the theory.  It is not supported by the contemporary evidence, and originates in a history of the Drummond family written by Viscount Strathallan in 1681.  Her death was probably a case of accidental food poisoning, a common cause of death at that time. The idea that James had to be pressured to marry Margaret Tudor is dubious. As Scotland was the less important and poorer country, it is more likely that James IV pressured Henry VII to give him his daughter. It is also clear that negotiations for the marriage had been taking place before Margaret Drummond died.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Margaret_Drummond_(mistress)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Clan_Drummond\" title=\"Clan Drummond\">Clan Drummond</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/List_of_poisonings\" title=\"List of poisonings\">List of poisonings</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Margaret_Drummond_(mistress)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Dickson, Thomas, ed., <i>Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland</i>, vol.1 (1877), pp.cxxii-cxxxiv</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-2\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Bergenroth, G., ed. &amp; trans., <i>Calendar of State Papers, Spain</i>, vol. 1, (1862), no.210</span>\n</li>\n</ol></div></div>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Norman_MacDougall\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Norman MacDougall\">Norman MacDougall</a>, <i>James the Fourth</i>, Tuckwell (1997)</li>\n<li>R.L.
