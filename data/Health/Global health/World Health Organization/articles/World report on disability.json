The aim of the report is to support the implementation of the <a href=\"/wiki/Convention_on_the_Rights_of_Persons_with_Disabilities\" title=\"Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities\">Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities</a> (CRPD). Published in 2011 by the <a href=\"/wiki/World_Health_Organization\" title=\"World Health Organization\">World Health Organization</a> (WHO) and the <a href=\"/wiki/World_Bank\" title=\"World Bank\">World Bank</a>, the report assembles scientific information on disability, with relevance to the fields of <a href=\"/wiki/Public_health\" title=\"Public health\">public health</a>, human rights and development. The intended audience is policy-makers, service providers, professionals, and advocates for people with disabilities and their families. The WRD was developed with participation of people with disabilities and their organizations, as well as other relevant stakeholders.<sup id=\"cite_ref-WRD_1-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-WRD-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Key_findings\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Key findings</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Main_messages\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Main messages</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Recommendations\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Recommendations</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Press_coverage\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Press coverage</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Follow-up\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Follow-up</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Key_findings\">Key findings</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=World_report_on_disability&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Key findings\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li>More than 1 billion persons in the world have some form of disability. This corresponds to about 15% of the world's population. Between 110-190 million people have very significant difficulties in functioning.</li>\n<li>People with disabilities are more likely to be unemployed than non-disabled people. In <a href=\"/wiki/Organization_for_Economic_Cooperation_and_Development\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development\">Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development</a> countries, the employment rate of people with disabilities (44%) is slightly over half that for people without disabilities (75%).</li>\n<li>People with disabilities often do not receive needed <a href=\"/wiki/Health_care\" title=\"Health care\">health care</a>. Half of disabled people cannot afford health care, compared to a third of non-disabled people.  People with disabilities are more than twice as likely to find health-care providers' skills inadequate; nearly three times more likely to be denied health care; and four times more likely to report being treated badly than non-disabled people.</li>\n<li>Children with disabilities are less likely to attend school than non-disabled children. Education completion gaps are found across all age groups in all settings, with the pattern more pronounced in poorer countries. Even in countries where most non-disabled children go to school, many children with disabilities do not go to school. For example in Bolivia about 98% of non-disabled children go to school, but under 40% of disabled children attend school. In Indonesia, over 80% of non-disabled children go to school, but less than 25% of children with disabilities go to school.</li>\n<li>People with disabilities experience increased dependency and restricted participation in their societies. Even in high-income countries, 20-40% of people with disabilities lack the help they require to engage in <a href=\"/wiki/Activities_of_daily_living\" title=\"Activities of daily living\">everyday activities</a>. In the United States of America, 70% of adults with disabilities rely on family and friends for assistance with daily activities.<sup id=\"cite_ref-WRD_1-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-WRD-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Main_messages\">Main messages</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=World_report_on_disability&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Main messages\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li>Disability prevalence is high and growing, due to aging populations and the increase in chronic conditions.

The goal of national launches and <a href=\"/wiki/Health_policy\" title=\"Health policy\">policy</a> dialogues is to help countries to use the WRD as a tool to strengthen their domestic policy and provision and/or international development work. Many countries now have national plans of action on disability, in line with the report\u2019s recommendation and/or are working to implement the CRPD, with the aid of the report.<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Implementing the recommendations of the WRD will require a strong commitment from a broad range of stakeholders. While national governments are expected to take on the most significant role, other actors can make important contributions. The report makes concrete recommendations on how United Nations agencies, Disabled People\u2019s Organizations, service providers, academic institutions, the private sector, communities and people with disabilities and their families can help translate the report into action. WHO is developing supporting materials, such as a model disability survey, guidelines on rehabilitation, and training on <a href=\"/wiki/Community-based_rehabilitation\" title=\"Community-based
