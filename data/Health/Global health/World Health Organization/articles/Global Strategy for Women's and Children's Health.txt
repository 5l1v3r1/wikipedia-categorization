The Global Strategy for Women's and Children's Health is a program of the United Nations (UN) directed at improving women's and children's health in the developing world. The program was announced by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in September 2010. At the time of the announcement, the program was valued at $US40 billion over a five-year period, funded by state and private donors,  with the UN hoping for more pledges to follow.  The object of the program is to save the lives of 16 million people during the period of the program.  The implementation of the program will be led by the World Health Organisation, reporting to the UN.  The aid-based program was accompanied by pledges from some developing nations (including Tanzania and Rwanda) to increase their own domestic spending on health care.  According to the UN, around $8.6 million of the program's funding came from what it described as "low-income countries".  International aid group Oxfam expressed doubts about the program, including the extent to which its funding was genuinely new.
