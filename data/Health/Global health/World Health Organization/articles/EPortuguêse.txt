 The ePORTUGUÊSe network  is a platform developed by the  World Health Organization (WHO) to strengthen collaboration among Portuguese-speaking countries in the areas of health information and capacity building of Human Resources for Health, therefore enhancing health information systems in those countries.  According to Ethnologue, Portuguese is the sixth most spoken language in the world and there are more than 300 million speakers distributed through eight countries (Angola, Brazil, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Portugal, São Tomé and Príncipe, and Timor-Leste) in four WHO Regional Offices (AFRO , PAHO-AMRO , EURO and SEARO ). Portuguese is also the third most spoken language in the Western hemisphere and the most widely spoken in the southern hemisphere.  In November 2012, ePORTUGUÊSe received a recognition award for its contribution to the South-South and Triangular collaboration at the UN High Level and Directors General Meeting during the Global Development EXPO 2012 held in Vienna, Austria.  The ePORTUGUÊSe network is part of the Knowledge Management and Sharing Department of the World Health Organization (WHO) in Geneva. The ePORTUGUÊSe network has focal points in every country that work together to support the dissemination of health information. The coordinator of the ePORTUGUÊSe Network is Dr Regina Ungerer. The members of the ePORTUGUÊSe network are: health and information professionals from the eight Portuguese-speaking countries: Angola, Brazil, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Portugal, São Tomé and Príncipe, and Timor-Leste, as well as anyone with an interest in supporting these countries.
