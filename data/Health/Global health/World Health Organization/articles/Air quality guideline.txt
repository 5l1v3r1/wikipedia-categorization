Air quality guideline is an annual mean concentration guideline for particulate matter from the World Health Organization. The guideline stipulates that PM2.5 not exceed 10 μg/m3 annual mean, or 25 μg/m3 24-hour mean; and that PM10 not exceed 20 μg/m3 annual mean, or 50 μg/m3 24-hour mean.  In terms of health effects, the guideline states that P2.5 concentration of 10 is the lowest level at which total, cardiopulmonary and lung cancer mortality have been shown to increase with more than 95% confidence in response to long-term exposure to PM2.5. Along with cardiopulmonary and lung cancer deaths, the chances of which an individual increases their risk of being diagnosed with these is highly coordinated to fine particulate matter and sulfur oxide- related pollution. "Each 10 μg/m³ m^3 elevation in fine particulate air pollution was associated with approximately a 4%, 6% and 8% increased risk of all-cause, cardiopulmonary, and lunch cancer mortality, respectively."
