World Hearing Day is held each year on March 3rd to promote hearing.  The first event was held in 2007.  Events have worked to increase knowledge about noise induced hearing loss and measures to prevent it.  Before 2016 it was known as International Ear Care Day.  The 2018 theme was “Hear the future” - or “Hear the future ... and prepare for it.”   The day is coordinated and publicized by the World Health Organization.
