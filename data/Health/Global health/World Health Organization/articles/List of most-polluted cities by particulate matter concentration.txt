This list contains the top 499 cities by PM2.5 annual mean concentration measurement whose measurement is greater than or equal to the air quality guideline (AQG) of 10  as documented by the World Health Organization covering the period from 2008 to 2016, with the majority of values being more recent than 2013. The 2018 version of the WHO database contains results of ambient (outdoor) air pollution monitoring from almost 2700 towns and cities in 91 countries.
