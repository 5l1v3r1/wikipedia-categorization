In order to reduce this burden it is important that national authorities have methods and tools based on solid scientific evidence and sound public health policy. The public needs to be aware of radon risks and the means to reduce and prevent these.\n</p><p>In 1996 WHO published a report containing several conclusions and recommendations covering the scientific understanding of radon risk and the need for countries to take action in the areas of risk management and risk communication.\n</p><p>Recent findings from case-control studies on lung cancer and exposure to radon in homes completed in many countries allow for substantial improvement in risk estimates and for further consolidation of knowledge by pooling data from these studies. The consistency of the findings from the latest pooled analyses of case-control studies from Europe and North America as well as China provides a strong argument for an international initiative to reduce indoor radon risks.\n</p><p>To fulfill these goals, WHO has developed a program on public health aspects of radon exposure. This project enjoys high priority with WHO's Department of Public Health and Environment. The key elements of the International Radon Project include:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Estimation of the <a href=\"/wiki/Disease_burden\" title=\"Disease burden\">global burden of disease</a> (GBD) associated with exposure to radon, based on the establishment of a global radon database</li>\n<li>Provision of guidance on methods for radon measurements and mitigation</li>\n<li>Developing evidence-based public health guidance for Member States to formulate policy and advocacy strategy including the establishment of radon action levels</li>\n<li>Development of approaches for radon risk communication.</li></ul>\n<p>To achieve these aims WHO has formed a network of key partner agencies from some 40 Member States. This network is the basis for the WHO International Radon Project which was launched in 2005. Working groups will collect and analyse information on radon risk, radon policies, radon mitigation and prevention as well as risk communication. The project members meet regularly and work towards achieving the outlined objectives.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"External_links\">External links</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=International_Radon_Project&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: External links\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.einnews.com/pr-news/43272-world-health-organization-lowers-radon-action-level-from-epa-s-4-0-to-2-7-to-reduce-lung-cancer-risk\">World Health Organization Lowers Radon Action Level from EPA's 4.0 to 2.7 to Reduce Lung Cancer Risk</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=International_Radon_Project&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2009/9789241547673_eng.pdf\">[1]</a></span>\n</li>\n</ol></div></div>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw2163\nCached time: 20180919161840\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.024 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.032 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 85/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 365/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 91/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 7/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 412/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\nLua time usage: 0.003/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 525 KB/50 MB\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   21.377      1 Template:Reflist\n100.00%   21.377      1 -total\n 13.30%    2.843      1 Template:Main_other\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:8105682-0!canonical and timestamp 20180919161840 and revision id 762624919\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[{"lang":"ru","url":"https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9F%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%82_%C2%AB%D0%A0%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BD%C2%BB","langname":"Russian","autonym":"\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439","*":"\u041f\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043a\u0442 \u00ab\u0420\u0430\u0434\u043e\u043d\u00bb"}],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","*":"World_Health_Organization"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Radon"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Background_radiation"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Disease burden"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Ionizing radiation"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Lung cancer"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Radon"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"World Health Organization"}],"templates":[{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Reflist"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Main other"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Check for unknown parameters"}],"images":[],"externallinks":["http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2009/9789241547673_eng.pdf","http://www.einnews.com/pr-news/43272-world-health-organization-lowers-radon-action-level-from-epa-s-4-0-to-2-7-to-reduce-lung-cancer-risk"],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"External links","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"International_Radon_Project","byteoffset":2549,"anchor":"External_links"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"References","number":"2","index":"2","fromtitle":"International_Radon_Project","byteoffset":2814,"anchor":"References"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"International Radon Project","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q6052633"}]}}
