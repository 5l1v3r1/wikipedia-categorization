It is a WHO tool for standardizing and assessing the availability of medical services in different countries. It is mostly used for emergency response.  When conducting programs using HeRAMS, information is collected from health facilities in a specific area. Then the analysis of the received data is carried out. The system collects information on four major contingencies related to emergencies: Based on the findings, WHO, in collaboration with local health ministries, makes analytical reports and develops possible measures to improve the situation.  WHO pays the greatest attention to countries with destroyed infrastructure, including medical ones.The evaluation was conducted in Sudan,   Mali,  Philippines,  Central African Republic,   Syria,  Fiji,   Nigeria,  Yemen.   In autumn 2017 World Health Organization, in cooperation with the Ministry of Healthcare of Ukraine, launched the HeRAMS Ukraine project.
