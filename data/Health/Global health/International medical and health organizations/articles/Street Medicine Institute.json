Street medicine practice is defined as those health care and related services that are delivered directly to persons sleeping on the streets, along the river banks, and in the abandoned buildings, <i>etc.</i>, of cities.\n</p><p>Pioneers of street medicine have been practicing their art as the world's homeless population has increased, but largely in isolation. <a href=\"/wiki/Social_network\" title=\"Social network\">Networking</a> efforts over that past two decades have resulted in the recognition that a new field of medicine has emerged.  The term Street Medicine, in this context, was coined by Dr. Jim Withers who has been one of the leaders in the movement.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> His program, <a href=\"/wiki/Operation_Safety_Net\" title=\"Operation Safety Net\">Operation Safety Net</a> in <a href=\"/wiki/Pittsburgh,_Pennsylvania\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\">Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania</a>, has hosted the annual <i>International Street Medicine Symposium</i> in various cities since 2005.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> At this first meeting, the keynote speaker was Dr. <a href=\"/wiki/Jack_Preger\" title=\"Jack Preger\">Jack Preger</a>. Preger has been practicing street medicine in <a href=\"/wiki/Calcutta,_India\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Calcutta, India\">Calcutta, India</a> since 1979 and has founded the <a href=\"/wiki/Calcutta_rescue\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Calcutta rescue\">Calcutta Rescue</a> relief agency. The group collaborates to improve the care of the unsheltered homeless (\"rough sleepers\"), to support street medicine practitioners, to conduct research, and to advocate for health care justice. As of 2007, twenty-one cities of the United States and eleven international cities in four continents are represented.\n</p><p>The <i>Street Medicine Institute</i> is being formed as a <a href=\"/wiki/Nonprofit\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Nonprofit\">nonprofit</a> to coordinate and enhance these activities. It has been supported by the <a href=\"/wiki/Robert_Wood_Johnson_Foundation\" title=\"Robert Wood Johnson Foundation\">Robert Wood Johnson Foundation</a> and the <a href=\"/wiki/Glaxo_Smith_Kline\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Glaxo Smith Kline\">Glaxo Smith Kline</a> Foundation. The purpose of the Institute includes the development of best practices for street medicine, the creation and enhancement of street medicine programs as requested, and the training of health care students who wish to specialize in the skills of street medicine practice. In 2007, the <i>Street Medicine Fellowship</i> was initiated through the Donald E. Withers, MD Memorial Fund for Street Medicine Education.\n</p><p>The Street Medicine collaborative group welcomes any persons or groups that have an interest in improving the lives of those who sleep on the street. Major partners include the National Health Care for the Homeless Council and the European Federation of National Organisations working with the Homeless\n.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Street_Medicine_Institute&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Srikameswaran, Anita. <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.post-gazette.com/healthscience/20020815withers5.asp\">\u201c\u2018Street doc\u2019 honored for work with homeless,\u201d</a> <i>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</i>, Thursday, August 15, 2002.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-2\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Malloy, Michael G. <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.aamc.org/newsroom/reporter/march03/homeless.htm\">\u201cPittsburgh\u2019s Operation Safety Net Is Making a Difference to the Underserved,\u201d</a> <i>AAMC Reporter</i>, March, 2003.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-3\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-3\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Fahy, Joe. <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/05283/585826-85.stm\">\u201cDoctors meeting here to consider street peoples\u2019 needs,\u201d</a> <i>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</i>, Monday, October 10, 2005.</span>\n</li>\n</ol></div></div>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw1324\nCached time: 20180908183412\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.044 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.058 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 114/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 605/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 89/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 7/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 1458/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\nLua time usage: 0.012/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 690 KB/50 MB\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   46.389      1 -total\n 67.83%   31.466      1 Template:For\n 25.75%   11.943      1 Template:Reflist\n  4.84%    2.246      1 Template:Main_other\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:9915976-0!canonical and timestamp 20180908183412 and revision id 827128722\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","*":"Health_charities_in_the_United_States"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Homelessness_charities"},{"sortkey":"","*":"International_medical_and_health_organizations"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Medical_and_health_organizations_based_in_Pennsylvania"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Calcutta, India"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Calcutta rescue"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Glaxo Smith Kline"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Homeless"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Jack Preger"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Nonprofit"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Operation Safety Net"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Robert Wood Johnson Foundation"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Social network"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Street Medicine (album)"}],"templates":[{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:For"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Reflist"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Main other"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:For"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Hatnote list"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Hatnote"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Yesno"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Arguments"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Check for unknown parameters"}],"images":[],"externallinks":["http://www.post-gazette.com/healthscience/20020815withers5.asp","http://www.aamc.org/newsroom/reporter/march03/homeless.htm","http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/05283/585826-85.stm"],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"References","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Street_Medicine_Institute","byteoffset":3077,"anchor":"References"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Street Medicine Institute","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q7623024"}]}}
