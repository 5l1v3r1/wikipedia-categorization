The World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH), formerly the Harry Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria Association (HBIGDA), is a professional organization devoted to the understanding and treatment of gender dysphoria. Professionals include anyone working in disciplines such as medicine, psychology, law, social work, counseling, psychotherapy, family studies, sociology, anthropology, speech and voice therapy and sexology.  Non-professionals may also join, paying the same membership fee, but without voting privileges.   The organization is funded by its membership and by donations and grants from non-commercial sources.  The organization was originally named after Harry Benjamin, one of the earliest physicians to work with transsexuals.   WPATH publishes the Standards of Care for the Health of Transsexual, Transgender, and Gender Nonconforming People, educates professionals and consumers, sponsors scientific conferences, and provides ethical guidelines for professionals.  The first version of the Standards of Care were published in 1979.  Version 7 was published in 2011.
