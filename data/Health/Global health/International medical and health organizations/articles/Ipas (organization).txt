Ipas is a global non-profit organization that works to increase women's ability to exercise their sexual and reproductive rights, and to end deaths and injuries from unsafe abortion. Ipas's work is grounded in the belief that women everywhere must have the opportunity to determine their futures, care for their families and manage their fertility. Through local, national and global partnerships, they work to ensure that women receive safe, respectful and comprehensive abortion care, including counselling and contraception, to prevent future unwanted pregnancies. Ipas works to improve women's access and right to safe abortion care and reproductive health services by: In 2017, Ipas (Nigeria), called for a review of Nigeria's law criminalising abortion in the country.  At a workshop covering Womanâ€™s Reproductive Health and Rights in Abuja, Nigeria, Ipas's Country Director spoke out about the issue, saying "Any law that does not recognise or reflect the true situation of the country is a dead law."  foegal   Ipas was founded in 1973, following the passage of the Helms Amendment,  which prohibits use of U.S. foreign aid to support abortion services overseas. Ipas began manufacturing and distributing manual vacuum aspiration (MVA) instruments in 1973.  Ipas launched the postabortion family planning initiative in 1990.  In 2003 Ipas created, defined and implemented the concept of "woman-centered comprehensive abortion care".  Ipas University, a self-paced online learning site for reproductive health care providers, launched in 2009.  Womancare Global, a wholly owned subsidiary of Ipas, also launched in 2009, to market and distribute the MVA instruments, as well as a number of other reproductive-health technologies.  By 2010 Ipas had offices in 13 countries and serves 40 countries in Africa, Asia and the Americas.  Not Yet Rain (2009) is a documentary film about abortion in Ethiopia, produced by filmmaker Lisa Russell and Ipas.
