Mending Kids  is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization that provides surgeries to children across the world while training local medical communities to become self-sustaining.  It brings surgical mission teams of doctors, nurses and volunteers who donate their time and services to travel to developing countries to perform procedures that range from pediatric open-heart, neuro, ENT, orthopedic or general surgeries on impoverished or orphaned children while establishing sustainable teaching programs.   Since 2006, it has helped thousands of children in 54 countries around the world, including the United States.  The organization currently operates in Burbank, California. Cris Embleton started volunteering nearly 30 years ago by helping local hospitals and communities. After the death of her adopted daughter just prior to her first birthday, she started her own Non-profit Organization - 'Healing the Children',  which is now running in 14  states. In order to expand the mission in California, Embleton and her local Board of Directors broke off from the organization and started Mending Kids International  in 2005.
