The Global Alliance to Prevent Prematurity and Stillbirth (GAPPS) was founded in 2007 as an initiative of Seattle Children’s. GAPPS’ mission is to lead a collaborative, global effort to increase awareness and accelerate innovative research and interventions that will improve maternal, newborn and child health outcomes around the world, with a focus on preterm birth and stillbirth.   The GAPPS Repository is a biobank of pregnancy specimens matched with data from patient questionnaires. It supports research on normal and abnormal pregnancies, including how pregnancy affects maternal and child health after delivery.   The Repository is also available to researchers to study the fetal origins of persistent health problems like diabetes, obesity, and hypertension.  In November 2011 the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation provided $20 million to GAPPS for the Preventing Preterm Birth initiative, part of the foundation's Grand Challenges in Global Health. The Preventing Preterm Birth initiative focuses on finding new interventions to prevent premature birth and stillbirth by limiting infection and improving nutrition.  Official website
