The International Partnership for Microbicides or IPM is a non-profit product development partnership (PDP) founded by Dr. Zeda Rosenberg in 2002 to prevent HIV transmission by accelerating the development and availability of a safe and effective microbicide for use by women in developing countries. Since its inception, IPM has focused on developing HIV-prevention products for women including gels, films, tablets and rings that contain antiretroviral (ARV)-based microbicides. Rights to incorporate existing ARVs into products developed specifically for use in developing countries have been negotiated with pharmaceutical companies working in the HIV field.
