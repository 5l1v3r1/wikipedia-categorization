The Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND) is a global health non-profit based in Geneva, Switzerland. FIND functions as a product development partnership, engaging in active collaboration with over 150 partners to facilitate the development, evaluation, and implementation of diagnostic tests for poverty-related diseases. The organisation's Geneva headquarters are in Campus Biotech. Country offices are located in New Delhi, India; Cape Town, South Africa; and Hanoi, Viet Nam. FIND was launched at the 56th World Health Assembly in 2003. In 2011, FIND was recognized as an "Other International Organization" by the Swiss Government, alongside DNDi and Medicines for Malaria Venture.  The organization focuses on improving diagnosis in several disease areas, including hepatitis C, HIV, malaria, neglected tropical diseases (sleeping sickness, Chagas disease, leishmaniasis, buruli ulcer), and tuberculosis. Alongside this, FIND works on diagnostic connectivity, antimicrobial resistance, acute febrile illness, and outbreak preparedness. To support this work, FIND engages in development of target product profiles, maintains clinical trial platforms, manages specimen banks, negotiates preferential product pricing for developing markets, and creates and implements trainings and lab strengthening tools. Work is guided by a Board of Directors which approves policies, organizational strategy and budget.  Staff and the Board of Directors are advised by a Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC), which provides advice on science and technology, assists in developing strategy, supports the scientific management process of projects, and offers support on issues ranging from diagnostics development to licensing.  FIND receives its funding from more than a dozen donors, including bilateral and multilateral organizations as well as private foundations.
