The Coalition against Typhoid (CaT) is a global forum of health and immunization experts working to save lives and reduce suffering by accelerating the delivery of typhoid vaccines to populations that need them most. Typhoid control requires a comprehensive strategy that combines immediate measures such as appropriate treatment and vaccination of high-burden and high-risk populations with sustainable long-term solutions like access to safe water, basic sanitation and promotion of good hygiene practices, including hand washing.   The primary goal of CaT is to define the barriers to adoption of typhoid vaccines in the communities where they are needed most, and discover key activities needed to overcome them.
