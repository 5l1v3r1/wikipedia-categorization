The RBM Partnership To End Malaria (formerly Roll Back Malaria Partnership) is the largest global platform for coordinated action towards a world free from malaria.  The partnership includes organizations from malaria endemic countries, bilateral and multilateral development partners, organizations from the private sector, nongovernmental and community-based organizations, foundations, research and academic institutions. Since its inception in 1998, the RBM Partnership has played a role in global efforts that reduced malaria deaths by over 60% and saved 7 million lives.  The RBM Partnership Host is the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS), an operational arm of the United Nations, supporting the implementation of its partners' peacebuilding, humanitarian, and development projects around the world.
