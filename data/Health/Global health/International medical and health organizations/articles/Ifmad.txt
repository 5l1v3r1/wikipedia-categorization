The International Forum on Mood and Anxiety Disorders or IFMAD is a professional organisation dedicated to raising awareness of the latest international thinking and innovations in mood and anxiety disorders and promoting the exchange of ideas across the global psychiatric community. IFMAD was founded in 2000 by Professor Siegfried Kasper and Professor Stuart Montgomery, supported by a scientific committee consisting of leading figures in mood and anxiety disorders from around the world. IFMAD organises a yearly congress to promote debate and highlight the latest research in mood and anxiety disorders. The annual event has become an important forum for the exchange of ideas and a key part of the congress calendar.
