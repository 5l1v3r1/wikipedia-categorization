Lions Eye Bank is the name of the various eye banks operated by the Lions Save Sight Foundation (LSSF), a not-for-profit foundation within the Lions Clubs International service organisation.  The Banks store and prepare donated corneas for transplantation. Corneas may be stored for up to seven days before being given to the ophthalmic surgeon for transplantation. There are over 60 Lions Eye Banks around the world, supported as ongoing projects by Lions service clubs.
