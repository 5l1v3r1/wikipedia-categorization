The International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) is a not-for-profit global membership organization of specialists in the field of blood coagulation and its disorders, such as thrombosis and hemophilia. It was founded in 1954 as the International Committee on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ICTH). The society was reorganized in 1969 as the ISTH.  It currently represents about 4000 members from 93 different countries.  The society initiates and promotes education and outreach initiatives, research activities, scientific meetings, peer-reviewed publications, expert committees and the development of standards allowing a common language and approach to basic and clinical science all over the world. It also publishes a medical journal, the Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis. The mission of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis is to advance the understanding, prevention, diagnosis and treatment of thrombotic and bleeding disorders. The Scientific and Standardization Committee (SSC) began in 1954 as the International Committee for the Standardization of the Nomenclature of the Blood Clotting Factors. The SSC is a permanent committee of the ISTH and is its scientific working arm. Conducted through 20 subcommittees and working groups, its activities promote cooperation among leading international scientists and direct their energies to projects that generate reliable and standardized clinical and basic science tools.  The ISTH hosts a biennial congress as well as annual meetings of the SSC. In odd-numbered years, SSC Meetings are held jointly with the congress.  The ISTH Academy is the online education platform for the society. The ISTH Academy features webinars, webcasts, online courses and access to abstracts and posters from past ISTH meetings.
