The World Alliance for Breastfeeding Action (WABA) is a network of people working on a global scale to eliminate obstacles to breastfeeding and to act on the Innocenti Declaration. The groups within this alliance tackle the problems from a variety of perspectives or point of views, such as consumer advocates, mothers, and lactation consultants.   Among the various organizations and individuals involved in the creation of WABA, Derrick and Pat Jelliffe, two experts in tropical paediatrics and infant nutrition, were instrumental in its founding and in the launching of some of its more visible early initiatives.      WABA organises the World Breastfeeding Week, held annually August 1 through the 7th, to put together the efforts of all breastfeeding advocates, governments, and the publicin more than 170 countries.  Several campaigns are associated with the WABA: 1991 to present - The Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) is a joint campaign by UNICEF and The World Health Organisation, and focuses mainly on hospital practices, implementing the principles of the Innocenti Declaration.  1993 - This campaign tackled the problem of developing mother-friendly workplaces.
