Cases of people choosing assisted suicide programs has been met with some controversy in the media and public. One famous case is that of Brittany Maynard. She was diagnosed with a terminal brain cancer and chose to end her life, but before that she chose to speak out about her situation and her choice, thus opening up the debate about the right-to-die movement in America.  Controversy also lies in issues regarding whether or not the right to die should be granted to those who are in a Minimally Conscious State (MCS).  MCS refers to people who have suffered neurological damage and will never fully recover, but still have some awareness. Groups, such as The National Right to Life Committee, fight against the movement to legalize and promote the right to die. Their goal is to prevent the determination of handicapped and senior individuals.
