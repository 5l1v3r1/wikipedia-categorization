Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance (Gavi for short; previously the GAVI Alliance,  and before that the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization)   is a publicâ€“private global health partnership committed to increasing access to immunisation in poor countries.  Gavi brings together developing country and donor governments, the World Health Organization, UNICEF,  the World Bank, the vaccine industry in both industrialised and developing countries, research and technical agencies, civil society, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and other private philanthropists. Gavi was created in 2000 as a successor to the Children's Vaccine Initiative, which had been launched in 1990.   Dr. Seth Berkley has been the CEO of GAVI since 2011.  The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has donated $1.5 billion to the alliance as of January 2013.  In August 2014, Gavi   changed its name from "GAVI Alliance" and introduced a new logo. Both changes were revealed in August;  it had by then acquired the gavi.org domain name and changed its primary domain from gavialliance.org to gavi.org.
