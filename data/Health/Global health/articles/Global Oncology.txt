Global Oncology (GO) is an American academic community-based healthcare organization. The organization was established at Harvard University in 2012. Global Oncology was founded in 2012, by Ami S. Bhatt and Franklin W. Huang.   The organization is composed of physicians, staff, students, and members of the oncology community and other skilled professional volunteers. The mission of the organization is to improve cancer care and research in resource-limited settings through a variety of programs and efforts, including the development of training and research opportunities in global oncology. The organization supports the efforts of other leading organizations working in global oncology and cancer care including the Global Task Force on Expanded Access to Cancer Care and Control in Developing Countries.  The steering committee that advises the organization is composed of academic and faculty experts in cancer care and oncology drawn from Harvard-affiliated institutions and hospitals, including Harvard Medical School, Harvard School of Public Health, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Children's Hospital Boston, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Massachusetts General Hospital.  A primary effort of GO has been the creation of the GO! Talks, a unique bi-monthly Global Oncology seminar series that seeks to educate the larger community on global oncology issues and catalyze collaborations in the field. Speakers to date have included Paul Farmer and Eric Krakauer.  Global Oncology  developed a first-of-its-kind Global Cancer Project Map that launched in 2015 as a resource for the global cancer community to identify projects and needs in global cancer work.
