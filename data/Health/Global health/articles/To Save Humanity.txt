To Save Humanity is a 2015 collection of 96 essays on global health from a collection of authors who range from heads of states, movie stars, scientists at leading universities, activists, and Nobel Prize winners. Each contributor was asked the same question: "What is the single most important thing for the future of global health over the next fifty years?"  The collection was edited by Julio Frenk and Steven J. Hoffman.  The Global Strategy Lab called the collection "unparalleled" and "a primer on the major issues of our time and a blueprint for post-2015 health and development," and featured it in their annual conference.  The Health Impact Fund also featured the collection at their conference.  The Lancet described the book as "testimony to the complexity of global health politics," and called it "a reminder that the breadth of individual and institutional engagement with global health cannot be fully captured by one set of global goals."  Vox has republished several of the articles for free online as part of a series entitled "One Change to Save the World."
