Petits Propos Culinaires is a journal of the history of food and cookery. Founded by Alan Davidson in 1979, it is now edited by Tom Jaine and is published by Prospect Books. The frequency of publication, three times a year, has not varied; nor has the format. Many of the articles and notes in Petits Propos Culinaires also served to enrich the Oxford Companion to Food.
