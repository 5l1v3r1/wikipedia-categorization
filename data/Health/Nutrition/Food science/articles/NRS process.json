It is used in beet-<a href=\"/wiki/Sugar\" title=\"Sugar\">sugar</a> factories to improve the capacity and operating time of evaporators and to produce soft <a href=\"/wiki/Molasses\" title=\"Molasses\">molasses</a> that can be further de-sugarised with <a href=\"/wiki/Chromatography\" title=\"Chromatography\">chromatography</a>.\n</p><p>The original technology was invented by AKZO for a different application. It was first used in French sugar factories, starting in the 1970s. Plants may have a capacity of some 100 up to 1000 m\u00b3/h and more.\nThe system is often used in the USA, France, and Britain. German sugar makers traditionally prefer to invest into bigger evaporation capacity.  \n</p><p>The NRS-installation will consist of a number of columns filled with strong-acid-cationic resin. It is installed after carbonatation and filtration and before evaporation.\nThe <a href=\"/wiki/Resin\" title=\"Resin\">resin</a> is loaded with <a href=\"/wiki/Sodium\" title=\"Sodium\">sodium</a> Na<sup>+</sup> <a href=\"/wiki/Ion\" title=\"Ion\">ions</a>, that are exchanged for calcium Ca<sup>++</sup>. The softened juice will then be evaporated.\n</p><p>For the regeneration of the resin softened juice will be mixed with caustic-soda (NaOH) and will be sent to the columns to transform the resin back into Na-form. The calcium-rich juice with high pH is sent in several fractions to the beginning of the clarification process, where alcalinisation is needed and the calcium is absorbed by the solid organic matter.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Features_of_the_process\">Features of the process</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=NRS_process&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Features of the process\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>It is effluent free and uses the product for regeneration.\nChemicals are consumed in about the same amount as in traditional technology.\nThe resin is robust, stable and not expensive.\nThe control technology is simple.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Effects_of_the_process\">Effects of the process</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=NRS_process&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Effects of the process\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li>Reduces the calcium content.</li>\n<li>Less soda needed.</li>\n<li>Reduces possible turbidity.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=NRS_process&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li>Lancrenon, X.
