Aspartame-acesulfame salt is an artificial sweetener marketed under the name Twinsweet. It is produced by soaking a 2-1 mixture of aspartame and acesulfame potassium in an acidic solution and allowing it to crystallize; moisture and potassium are removed during this process. It is approximately 350 times as sweet as sucrose. It has been given the E number E962.  Aspartame-acesulfame salt was invented in 1995 by sweetener expert Dr John Fry  while working for The Holland Sweetener Company (HSC), a subsidiary of DSM |DSM. HSC marketed it with the name Twinsweet. It was approved for use as an artificial sweetener in the European Parliament and Council Directive 94/35 EC as amended by Directive 2003/ 115/ EC in 2003. In North America it falls under the same regulations as aspartame and acesulfame-K, and is also approved for use in China, Russia, Hong-Kong, Australia and New Zealand. In December 2006 HSC ceased all of its aspartame operations, citing a glut in the market driving prices below profitable values.  The rights to aspartame-acesulfame are now owned by The NutraSweet Company Inc who have continued to market the sweetener successfully in the USA and EU.
