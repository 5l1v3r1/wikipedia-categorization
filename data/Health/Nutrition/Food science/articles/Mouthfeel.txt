Mouthfeel refers to the physical sensations in the mouth caused by food or drink, as distinct from taste. It is a fundamental sensory attribute which, along with taste and smell, determines the overall flavor of a food item.   Mouthfeel is also sometimes referred to as texture.  It is used in many areas related to the testing and evaluating of foodstuffs, such as wine-tasting and food rheology.   It is evaluated from initial perception on the palate, to first bite, through mastication to swallowing and aftertaste. In wine-tasting, for example, mouthfeel is usually used with a modifier (big, sweet, tannic, chewy, etc.) to the general sensation of the wine in the mouth.   Mouthfeel is often related to a product's water activityâ€”hard or crisp products having lower water activities and soft products having intermediate to high water activities.
