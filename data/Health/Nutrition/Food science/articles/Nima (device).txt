Nima is a portable connected food sensor. The first product, a gluten sensor was released in Fall 2016. The second product, a peanut sensor is scheduled to be released in the second half of 2018. A food sample is placed in a one-time use capsule, which is inserted into the Nima sensor. Once the test begins, the food is mixed with proprietary antibodies and analyzed by the sensor for approximately two to three minutes. If the sample contains less than twenty parts per million of gluten (the same limit required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for gluten-free labeling), or less than ten parts per million of peanut, Nima displays a smiley face; otherwise a "gluten found" or "peanut found" icon is displayed. The device has not been approved by the FDA, although the developers contest that such approval is not necessary because they "are not using it to diagnose or manage disease."  Nima has also developed a companion application for iOS and Android, connected through Bluetooth, that allows users to connect with other Nima owners and find allergen information for specific restaurants and packaged foods.  The company plans to eventually expand its technology to detect other allergens, such as dairy and tree nuts. They are also exploring detection methods for additives, GMOs, preservatives and possible causes of food poisoning.  Nima was listed among Time magazine's best inventions of 2015.  It has also received positive reviews in ''Popular Science''   and ''The Medical Futurist''
