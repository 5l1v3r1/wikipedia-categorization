The Ikaria Study is a small-scale survey by  the University of Athens School of Medicine of the diet and lifestyle of  Greek people over age 80 on the island of Ikaria.  The study found that the Ikarian diet includes olive oil, red wine, fish, coffee, herbal tea, honey, potatoes, garbanzo beans, black-eyed peas, lentils, and a  limited amount of meat, sugar and dairy products,  except goat milk.  The data showed that people on Ikaria were  reaching the age of 90 at 2.5 times the rate Americans do, and that  Ikarian men   are almost four times as likely as American men to reach age 90.
