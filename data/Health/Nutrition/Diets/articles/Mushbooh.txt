If Wiktionary does not have the definition yet, consider moving the whole section to Wiktionary by replacing this tag with the template {{Copy to Wiktionary}}.  This template will no longer automatically categorize articles as candidates to move to Wiktionary. Mushbooh (Arabic: مشبوه‎) is a food designation in Islam.
