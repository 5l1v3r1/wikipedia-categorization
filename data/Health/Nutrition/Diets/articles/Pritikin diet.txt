The Pritikin diet is a low-fat, high-fibre diet which forms part of the "Pritikin Program for Diet and Exercise", a lifestyle regimen originally created by Nathan Pritikin. The 1979 book describing the diet became a best-seller.   The diet is based around low-fat, high-fibre food and limiting red meat, alcohol and processed food.  When it was launched the diet was considered radical, but its precepts are now considered largely in alignment with mainstream nutritional advice.  The Pritikin Diet has been categorized as a fad diet with possible disadvantages including a boring food choice, flatulence, and the risk of feeling too hungry.
