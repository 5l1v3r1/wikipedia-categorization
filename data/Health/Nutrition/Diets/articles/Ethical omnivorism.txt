Ethical omnivorism  or compassionate carnivorism  (as opposed to obligatory carnivorism, the view that it is obligatory for people to eat animals)  is a human diet involving the consumption of meat, eggs, dairy and produce that can be traced back to a farm that raises grass-fed, free range, antibiotic and hormone-free livestock, uses GMO-free feed, and grows pesticide-free produce and greens. Ocean fish consumption is limited to sustainably farm-raised and/or ethically and wild caught, without contributing to illegal poaching. Critics contend that ethical omnivorism places greater strain on animals and the environment than intensive animal farming.   This diet tries to increase consumer support for more ethical meat production with the aim that it might be able to give incentive for more restaurants and stores to use ethical sources.  The vegan philosophy criticises and rejects the very concept of ethical omnivorism. Vegans think that breeding animals for the purpose of consumption is inherently unethical, making the point that inevitably a day will come for the animal to be slaughtered and on this day the animal would experience fear and distress, and pain during the slaughter. They believe that giving life to a living being only for this life to be taken at a later point is unethical. Vegans see 'free range' or 'organic' as labels applied by the agriculture industry but lacking true animal concern.
