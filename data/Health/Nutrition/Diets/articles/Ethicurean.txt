An ethicurean is a person who attempts to combine ethical food consumption with an interest in epicureanism, eating ethically without depriving oneself of taste.  The approach takes into account the effect of one's food production and consumption on the environment, as well as the quality of life of animals involved in production of anything they consume. An ethicurean also commits to minimizing the amount of waste produced, the recycling of waste and the mindful use of resources (energy, water etc.). The word Ethicurean (rhymes with Epicurean, with which it is broadly synonymous) is used as both a noun and an adjective. As an adjective, it refers to tasty things that are also sustainable, organic, local, and/or ethical — SOLE food, for short.  As a noun, ethicurean means someone who seeks out ethicurean food, and pursues an ethicurean approach to food. The term originated with the ethicurean group blog with the groups blog's announcement of existence in May 2006  There is considerable discussion regarding what is an ethicurean diet.  The following is an incomplete and sometimes conflicting list of considerations about what to eat.  For example, Fair Trade items may have many food miles, but the distance traveled is offset by the fair price paid to producers.
