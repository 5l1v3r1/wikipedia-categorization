The rhubarb diet is a fad diet, originating in the Huangdi Neijing, which is gaining popularity in Western Europe. It entails substituting boiled rhubarb and dairy products (normally milk) for two meals daily.  The laxative effect of rhubarb may aid weight loss.  Advocates claim that rhubarb increases the effect of iron from dairy products, causing the body to store less fat.  People who have tried the diet claim they have lost, on average, 4 kilograms (9Â lb) per month.
