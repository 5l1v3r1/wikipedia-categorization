The Med Mark is a packaging symbol that helps consumers identify Mediterranean diet foods. The Med Mark is a postage-stamp-sized symbol, featuring an image of an amphora, the jug used 3,000 years ago by Mediterranean cultures to store and ship their foods and drinks.  It directs consumers to a website that provides information on the diet pattern. Products that bear the mark must adhere to specific health and nutrition guidelines created with reference to the Food and Drug Administration, and must be a part of the Mediterranean Diet Pyramid created by Oldways, the Harvard School of Public Health, and the World Health Organization in 1993.  The mark was launched June 2007.
