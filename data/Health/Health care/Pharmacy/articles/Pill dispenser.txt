Pill dispensers are items which release medication at specified times.  Their purpose is to help senior citizens and other people who may suffer from impaired ability to adhere to their prescribed medication regime. Pill dispensers are commonly used to serve medical purposes, as well as to help individuals, be that the elderly or chronically ill, take their prescription medication, OTC medication or daily supplements at a given date and time. There are telehealth products in the health care industry such as automated or electronic pill boxes that function to alert the patients when it is time to take their medications. When the time comes to take the medication, the device automatically releases the pre-measured dose into a small compartment that is easily opened and sounds a loud signal that it is time to take the medication. If the patient doesn't take the medication out of the dispenser door, the pill dispenser will send a signal to a monitoring station who can contact the patient, family, or caregiver who can address the situation.
