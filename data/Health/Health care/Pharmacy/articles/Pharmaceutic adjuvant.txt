In pharmacology, adjuvants are drugs that have few or no pharmacological effects by themselves, but may increase the efficacy or potency of other drugs when given at the same time. For instance, caffeine has minimal analgesic effect on its own, but may have an adjuvant effect when given with paracetamol (acetaminophen).
