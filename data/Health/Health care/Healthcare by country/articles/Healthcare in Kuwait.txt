Kuwait has a state-funded healthcare system, which provides treatment without charge to holders of a Kuwaiti passport. A public insurance scheme exists to provide reduced cost healthcare to non-citizens. Private healthcare providers also run medical facilities in the country, available to members of their insurance schemes.  The government maintains the Kuwaiti Health Office in London to deal with the funding of treatment for Kuwaiti citizens in the UK. Â£13 million was embezzled from it between 2009 and 2016 by four accountants who worked there in collaboration with 20 doctors working in British hospitals.
