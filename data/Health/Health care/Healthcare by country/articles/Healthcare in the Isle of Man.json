It was clear that the Board would have to be collecting National Health Insurance contributions from that date  to ensure reciprocity with the United Kingdom.\n</p><p>The  Mental Hospital Board was renamed the Health Services Board under the Health Services Board Act which was passed on 15 June 1948 and took on responsibility for the Cronk Ruagh Sanatorium and White Hoe Isolation Hospital. The voluntary hospitals Management Committees continued, but were now  overseen by and responsible to politicians - something they did not welcome. One-third of their members were now appointed by the Board, to be responsible to the Board, and  their accounts and activities were subject to monthly scrutiny. They were assimilated in 1963.\n</p><p>The Isle of Man Health Services Act was not passed until 10 August 1948.  It was agreed that the term \"people of the Isle of Man\" could and should be interpreted as including anybody physically present on the Island at the time, so that visitors - mostly from the UK - would be covered. In return the English NHS agreed that Manx patients could be sent, as necessary, for free treatment in English hospitals, and for other treatment not available on the Island.\n</p><p>32 General practitioners, 40 chemists, 16 dentists and 10 opticians joined the service at its inception.  There were 28 specialist hospital doctors: 9 full-time, 12 part-time, and 7 visiting from England. For the first nine months of operation to 31 March 1949 the costs came to \u00a3197,200. The estimate for the first full year to 31 March 1950, was \u00a3454,668.  By 1954 the Board was under pressure to reduce its expenditure by 20%. The Board responded by insisting that this would require reductions in the service which would have to be determined by the Government.  The National Health Service Act 1950, widened the Board's powers to introduce charges, and in November 1950 a charge of 6d. per prescription form was introduced.  This caused all but six of the chemists to withdraw their services for a fortnight. In December 1950 the Board introduced a range of exemptions from charges.  Charges for dental treatment were introduced in 1950 and, in 1952, charges for spectacles at 10/- a lens, and the whole cost of an approved frame.\n</p><p>There was considerable administrative support from the English NHS.  The Manchester Prescription Pricing Bureau dealt with the invoicing of prescribed medicine.<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup>  A Prescribing Committee, was established of whose six members four were doctors and one a chemist.  Charges for prescriptions were increased in April 1953 to 1/- per form.\n</p><p>In 1954 the Board took responsibility for the Welfare Food Scheme.  Orange juice, cod liver oil, and vitamin tablets were distributed through the Infant Welfare Clinics, of which there were then ten.  They were free to all children under five, and to expectant and nursing mothers in necessitous circumstances.  In the year to March, 1956 25,884 bottles of orange juice, 4,776 bottles of cod liver oil, and 594 packets of vitamin tablets were distributed.  It also ran the Cheap Milk Scheme.  From 1951 this was subject to a means test.  In 1955/6, this was a household income not exceeding \u00a35 a week, with the addition of 6/- for each dependent member. There were 176 beneficiaries, including 6 nursing or expectant mothers.  A Home Help Scheme was also established and by 1959 there were  25 Home Helps.\n</p><p>The School Dental Service provided free treatment for children of school age, and they were originally not eligible for free treatment from other dentists except in an emergency.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Healthcare_in_the_Isle_of_Man&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/Health_in_the_Isle_of_Man\" title=\"Health in the Isle of Man\">Health in the Isle of Man</a>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Healthcare_in_the_Isle_of_Man&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap mw-references-columns\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><cite class=\"citation web\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://www.gov.im/media/1356624/dhsc-programme-for-government-delivery-plan.pdf\">\"Department of Health and Social Care Programme for Government Service Delivery Plan 2017/18\"</a> <span style=\"font-size:85%;\">(PDF)</span>. <i>Isle of Man Government</i><span class=\"reference-accessdate\">.
