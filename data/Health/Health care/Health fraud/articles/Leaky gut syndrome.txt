Leaky gut syndrome is a hypothetical, medically unrecognized condition.  Unlike the scientific phenomemon of increased intestinal permeability ("leaky gut"),   claims for the existence of "leaky gut syndrome" as a distinct medical condition come mostly from nutritionists and practitioners of alternative medicine.    Proponents claim that a "leaky gut" causes chronic inflammation throughout the body that results in a wide range of conditions, including chronic fatigue syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus,  migraines, multiple sclerosis, and autism.   As of  2016[update], there is little evidence to support the hypothesis that leaky gut syndrome directly causes this wide array of diseases.   Stephen Barrett has described "leaky gut syndrome" as a fad diagnosis and says that its proponents use the alleged condition as an opportunity to sell a number of alternative-health remedies â€“ including diets, herbal preparations, and dietary supplements.  In 2009 Seth Kalichman wrote that some pseudoscientists claim that the passage of proteins through a "leaky" gut is the cause of autism.  The belief that a "leaky gut" might actually cause autism is popular among the public, but the evidence is weak and what evidence exists is conflicting.  Advocates tout various treatments for "leaky gut syndrome", such as dietary supplements, probiotics, herbal remedies, gluten-free foods, and low-FODMAP, low-sugar, or antifungal diets, but there is little evidence that the treatments offered are of benefit.  None have been adequately tested to determine if they are safe and effective for this purpose.  The U.K. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) does not recommend the use of special diets to manage the main symptoms of autism.
