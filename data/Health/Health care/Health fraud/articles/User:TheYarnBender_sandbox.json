That\u2019s when, during a trip to the Silver Dollar theme park in Missouri, the parents noticed something very wrong:\n</p><p>The family\u2019s ordeal began in October 2016, when the Sooters spent a day at the Silver Dollar City theme park in Missouri. There, Matt\u2019s mother noticed that Adalynn \u2014 who the family calls \u201cAddy\u201d \u2014 was walking \u201cfunny.\u201d Matt, who first shared his story with Love What Matters, says he noticed a \u201chitch\u201d in Addy\u2019s step as well.\n</p><p>\u201cWe were confused, but we thought it could be because of the growth spurt she had just gone through,\u201d he tells PEOPLE. \u201cAs it got worse, we became more and more concerned.\u201d\n</p><p>Throughout the weeks that followed, Matt and Chandra noticed that Addy was having even more trouble walking, often stumbling and falling. He says the little girl even had difficulty holding her eating utensils.\n</p><p>Worried, they took the then-2-year-old to the hospital where doctors found a tumor growing on the girl\u2019s brain stem. She was diagnosed with DPIG. Doctors said the little girl would likely live for only a few more months.\n</p><p>...after her therapy began at Arkansas Children\u2019s Hospital in November 2016:\n</p><p>Over the next few weeks, Addy endured dozens of radiation treatments and, much to the family\u2019s delight, the tumor shrank to nearly half its size.\n</p><p>By July 2017, doctors noticed the tumor had begun to grow again. They told the devastated parents that there was nothing more they could do for the little girl.\n</p><p>For nearly a year, they\u2019ve taken the little girl to Monterrey for treatment and Matt says a single trip can last up to 12 days. Travel and medical expenses have cost the family more than $200,000 \u2014 but Matt says he and Chandra would do anything for their now 4-year-old daughter.\n</p><p>The story thus far comes primarily from a PEOPLE Magazine story from a little over a month ago. \n</p><p>At that point, the \u201cexperimental therapy\u201d in Monterrey had clearly failed, but the Sooters nonetheless thought it had done her daughter some good before it \u201cceased to work\u201d:\n</p><p>Now \u2014 more than 18 months later \u2014 the Rogers, Arkansas, girl has shocked medical officials with her survival. But the girl\u2019s parents, Matt and Chandra Sooter, say they know her days are numbered.\n</p><p>\u201cThe fact that she\u2019s survived over 18 months now is purely incredible. Her doctors have grown to love her and have been amazed by how well she has done,\u201d Matt tells PEOPLE. \u201cWhile we\u2019re doing everything we can to change the outcome we don\u2019t expect to win this fight. We haven\u2019t given up, but it seems we are losing the war.\u201d\n</p><p>...what does matter is that such estimates feed into the narrative used to sell unproven treatments that \u201ctreatment X kept this patient alive far longer than the doctors thought she would live.\u201d Never mind that in this case (as in many cases) Addy Joy had received the full course of conventional therapy, with a very good response lasting seven months.\n</p><p>In a more detailed account of Addy Joy\u2019s story published in Love What Matters, there\u2019s not much more detail about this experimental treatment in Mexico:\n</p><p>\"In July of 2017 an MRI confirmed that her tumor was once again growing. During those months we searched the globe for a treatment. We spoke with doctors in New York, London, Mexico, and nearly everywhere in-between. The week before Addy\u2019s MRI we received word that she had been accepted into an experimental program in Monterrey, Mexico. After the MRI I sent my wife, Addy, and our son to spend the weekend with family while I made preparations to travel to Mexico. The next week we were all on a plane toward a lot of unknowns. We prepared for a long trip because we didn\u2019t know how long we would be there. Our first meeting with the doctors in Mexico and Addy\u2019s first treatment all went well and we were able to return home after only a few days. Since then we\u2019ve been traveling back and forth every three to six weeks to have treatment. These treatments have been expensive, totaling over $250,000 for treatments and airfare since July 2017.\"\n</p><p>\"On Monday, May 7th, Addy and my wife were once again in Monterrey for treatment. We were anxious about this trip because Addy had been presenting some symptoms and we were unsure of what was causing them. After her MRI, the doctors came out and informed us that she had developed hydrocephalus, a fluid build up in her brain, and that she would need a shunt placed immediately to drain the fluid. Treatment was postponed and my wife booked a flight straight to Little Rock. Addy\u2019s shunt was placed and an MRI performed on her spine based on some things the doctors saw on another MRI of her brain. On Wednesday the 9th, we found out that Addy\u2019s cancer had spread to the lower part of her brain and on down her spine as well. Her Mexico treatment that has kept her cancer stabilized is no longer working either because the protocol has changed, or because the tumor has mutated.\"\n</p><p>And so Addy\u2019s story ended tragically, leaving a devastated family having spent a quarter of a million dollars for a treatment whose components we don\u2019t even know. \n</p><p>Addy Joy\u2019s not alone, either. There is a veritable pipeline from Australia to Monterrey for patients with DIPG to be treated in the same clinic where Addy Joy Sooter was treated, as you will see.\n</p><p>Some persistent Googling and perusing of the Sooters\u2019 Facebook page revealed the name of the clinic in a story in the Daily Mail.\n</p><p>When I read this, I shuddered. Intra-arterial chemotherapy? Into the brainstem? Well, it is an experimental therapy. I found some references to a trial at Johns Hopkins, for instance. It is, however, a phase I trial. It involves the use of intra-arterial Melphalan, two doses. Because it is a phase I trial, it is definitely not an efficacy trial; indeed, the ClinicalTrials.gov entry specifically states that it is a feasibility study to \u201cperform a qualitative evaluation of whether or not we can safely deliver IA chemotherapy to patients with progressive DIPG.\u201d Also, the status of the trial is listed on ClinicalTrials.gov as \u201cSuspended (Study has been placed on hold for an interim review.)\u201d In this context, \u201csuspended\u201d means that the trial was halted early but might start up again. Interestingly, the Johns Hopkins website says the trial is \u201ccurrently closed for analysis.\u201d To me, a suspension makes me wonder if there were toxicity problems, but there is no way of knowing why the trial was suspended without contacting the PI or when (if ever) the trial will be restarted. It\u2019s also hard not to note that the study start date was in 2013. Five years is a long time to take to accrue to a phase I study, given how small phase I studies usually are, even if the investigators are allowing two years for assessment of progression-free survival. A search of PubMed reveals that the results of the trial haven\u2019t been published yet; hopefully the study will be completed and published soon.\n</p><p>This is a technique that\u2019s being done at Hopkins, but that the group there hasn\u2019t published on yet. That makes it not only experimental, but nowhere near proven or even shown to be promising yet. That\u2019s assuming that the doctors at the Mexican clinic are even doing the same or a similar protocol. Then they\u2019re adding some sort of immunotherapy. It\u2019s all unspecified, though. Nowhere is there published a protocol, results, or anything other than testimonials and anecdotes.\n</p><p>Making DIPG History in Monterrey, along with the site\u2019s Facebook and Instagram pages. These sites are all run by a naturopath named Kim Beauchamp, who has a relative with DIPG:\n</p><p>The cost of one year of treatment in Monterrey amounts to over $300,000\u2014without accounting for unexpected complications and extended hospital stays. \n</p><p>Kim Beauchamp is a naturopathic doctor and writer. In the fall of 2016, her cousin Jeni\u2019s daughter Kira was diagnosed with DIPG. \n</p><p>After spending a week with Jeni and Kira in Mexico and witnessing first hand the effects of DIPG on children, the incredible demands on their caretakers, and the profound changes that the treatment in Monterrey is making for the children receiving it, Kim reached out to photographer and pediatric cancer awareness Project 3.8 founder Robyn Ivy about going to Monterrey to chronicle these children\u2019s journeys with DIPG together.\n</p><p>Here, I note that in my original version of this post I mistakenly characterized Ms. Beauchamp\u2019s site as affiliated with Cl\u00ednica 0-19. It is not.\n</p><p>For instance, the website declares that \u201cwe are experts in the integrative and alternative management of cancer\u201d and boasts about using the \u201cmost advanced techniques of traditional and alternative medicine.\u201d \n</p><p>There is an \u201corthomolecular therapist.\u201d Orthomolecular medicine, as you might recall, is a quackery that basically uses megadoses of vitamins and nutrients to treat all manner of diseases. \n</p><p>It all boils down to Drs. Alberto Siller and Alberto Garcia of Instituto de Oncolog\u00eda Intervencionista (IDOI), which also has a slick website declaring it to be \u201d leader of the intra-arterial brain tumors procedure and recognized for its Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG) treatment.\u201d There\u2019s also an application to be treated asking for basic information (name, age, etc.), clinical history, plus videos of the child eating, walking, and speaking, along with MRI files. Demonstrating that crowdfunding is basically a part of this \u201cinstitute\u2019s\u201d business model, there is also a question, \u201cIf the patient has a funding campaign, please share it with us so we can promote it with local nonprofit organizations who focus on raising funds for these causes.\u201d Basically, what I gathered from various websites is that IDOI sees its patients in consult and followup at Cl\u00ednica 0-19 but does the actual invasive radiology procedures at local hospitals in and around Monterrey, primarily at Hospital Angeles, admitting them there for treatment.\n</p><p>\"The intra-arterial treatment exists since long and is performed continuously in diverse countries. What IDOI does differently is the preparation, mixing, dosage and sequential administration of the different medications that integrates the treatment\u2019s model. It also uses the intrathecal route to administer certain medication.\n</p><p>The interventional oncology that IDOI performs consists in a puncture made in the femoral artery through which a micro catheter is inserted and directed by fluoroscopy to the blood supply site of the tumor.\n</p><p>The risks related with the procedure are minimal and imply the formation of a hematoma in the puncture site (less than 5%) and a possible vascular event such as a stroke (less than 0.7%). The other part of the procedure consists in making a lumbar puncture after the intra-arterial treatment with the application of medications.\n</p><p>The inherent risks of this procedure are pain in the puncture site, the formation of a hematoma and some irritation of the cauda equine(radiculitis) that occurs in less than 1% of the cases.\n</p><p>All medication used by IDOI are approved by Cofepris and FDA.\"\n</p><p>A particularly glaring omission here is\u2026oh\u2026you know\u2026the risk of injecting chemotherapy right into the major arteries leading to the brainstem! \n</p><p>\"How successful are you in your treatments?\nThe treatment program of the Institute of Interventional Oncology for patients with DIPG began many years ago. We have treated adult and child patients with different types of brain tumors in addition to DIPG. The response rate to our management scheme is very high and treatment-related toxicity is very low. Many of these patients are free of disease years after their treatment has been discontinued and some have died from accidents or situations unrelated to the tumor and / or treatment.\n</p><p>Are there any publications in the peer-reviewed medical literature or statistics provided? Of course not!  Even worse, they will not even give examples of which drugs are used:\n</p><p>\"What agents are being administered?\nSince the beginning of our program the treatment scheme has maintained a basic structure of medicines used to treat cancer. We are constantly evaluating new drugs and replacing each one with the purpose of improving our results. All the medications we use are FDA approved. What makes this program different is not only the route of administration but the dosage and sequence of administration of the products. With the arrival of a new category of products called molecular targeted therapy, our results have significantly improved.\"\n</p><p>Dr. Siller could provide examples of the drugs (or a subset of the drugs) used if he wished to. He does not, and that is utterly irresponsible. \n</p><p>But what about the \u201cimmunotherapy\u201d? This is about all the clinic website says:\n</p><p>\"Can you explain the immunotherapy done in your program?\nOur Immunotherapy program consists in the application of patient\u2019s own immunological cells extracted previously and \u201cactivated\u201d to recognize and destroy the tumor cells of the patient.\"\n</p><p>This could mean anything from just removing the patient\u2019s white blood cells and treating them with various cytokines to \u201cactivate\u201d them to doing a poor man\u2019s CAR-T therapy. \n</p><p>The bottom line, I have to conclude, is that I have no idea what these guys are doing and calling \u201cimmunotherapy.\u201d I also have little idea what they are doing except injecting chemotherapy into arteries leading to the brainstem given that they don\u2019t state which drugs they are using or on what basis a chemotherapy regimen is chosen for each patient. Their treatment is a black box.\n</p><p>He said the main problem with established medical protocol was that \u201cyou cannot move a millimetre outside what is written because you are out of the protocol. We are not using that. We are tailoring our treatment to every patient based on the circumstances.\u201d\n</p><p>In other words, we make it up as we go along and can\u2019t tell you how we do it in a sufficiently clear manner to make it possible to write a protocol to do it in a clinical trial. This, of course, also means that they can\u2019t teach their technique for picking chemotherapy drugs to anyone else. \n</p><p>Australian newspapers have published several Daily Mail-like credulous articles about Australian children with DIPG being taken to Monterrey by their parents for \u201clast resort\u201d experimental therapy. For example, in February, there was a headline in the Daily Telegraph \u201cLittle Annabelle Potts and her family have found hope with brain tumour treatment in Mexico.\u201d \n</p><p>There\u2019s another girl with DIPG being treated named Annabelle, Annabelle Nguyen. I also learned this:\n</p><p>\"They combined around 11 cocktail of drugs go in through the groin and then through the back with catheters, and inject a certain sequence of drugs to the brain stem and then they combine with Immunotherapy. We are looking at lifelong treatment till we get NED.\"\n</p><p>I point to similar stories about other children from Australia, such as Doris Sun, Riaa Kulkarni, and several others.\n</p><p>Exactly. Siller and Garcia have been at this two decades. \n</p><p>Elsewhere in the story, Dr. Siller is quoted as saying that he and Dr. Garcia aren\u2019t making much money from their treatment. Never mind that the story also reports that their DIPG treatment makes up the bulk of their business now, that they now employ ten physicians, and have struck deals with local hospitals, such as Hospital Angeles, to treat their patients there. They also claim that they\u2019d love to publish their results, but, sorry, they\u2019re too darned busy working 18 hour days to save lives.\n</p><p>Drs. Siller and Garcia also claim they have four patients with NED, including Annabelle Potts and Annabelle Nguyen, who were discussed above. Let\u2019s look at updates for Annabelle Potts first. On her GoFundMe page we find an update from last month:\n</p><p>\"Last week, Annabelle just had her 10th IA treatment. The results from the MRI is not the news is not what we have hoped for. The original tumour is still essentially \u2018dead\u2019, but it looks as if there is some small new growth into the cerebellum. While this is absolutely not what we hoped for, we are so grateful that the doctors in Mexico picked this up before treatment and treated the area immediately!\"\n</p><p>I also can\u2019t help but wonder if some of the progression observed in some of these patients was the same phenomenon that so often fooled Burzynski: Pseudoprogression. Pseudoprogression is a common phenomenon in brain tumors where, after conventional treatment with radiation and/or chemotherapy, the tumor will appear to be progressing because inflammation around the dying tumor appears indistinguishable from tumor on MRI. Any treatment, even ineffective treatment, will appear to \u201cwork\u201d if administered while the cancer is in pseudoprogression because eventually the inflammation settles down and the area that lights up as a mass on MRI shrinks. \n</p><p>Annabelle Nguyen has fallen into a coma, and her family is stuck in Monterrey:\n</p><p>Unfortunately, the Nguyen family are victims of arrogant and unscrupulous doctors, aided and abetted by social media that lead new victims to their clinic.\n</p><p>If Drs. Siller and Garcia truly have made a major advancement in the treatment of DIPG, they have a moral obligation to publish their existing results and to accept help from the international medical oncology community to test their treatment in proper clinical trials. Continuing to charge $30,000 a pop for an unproven treatment for 10+ treatments is immoral given that there is no evidence that their treatment is superior to existing therapies. The longer they fail to do that, the more I suspect that the reason they don\u2019t do it is because they don\u2019t want to endanger their revenue stream.\n</p>\n<ul><li>* *</li></ul>\n<p><sup id=\"cite_ref-SBM2&quot;_6-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-SBM2&quot;-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>To be an experimental therapy, the treatment has to be in active testing in the lab and in clinical trials, and the doctors running IDOI are not doing any research. They\u2019re just treating and charging patients, excusing themselves from even the most basic requirement of publishing their own survival and recurrence statistics by saying they\u2019re \u201ctoo busy saving lives.\u201d \n</p><p>Indeed, on the IDOI website under \u201cmedications,\u201d this is all they say:\n</p><p>\"As part of our protocol we use an array of different drugs. Some of the drugs are helpful for cytotoxic chemotherapy, molecular targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. All these drugs are used in a particular sequence and dosage. All drugs are perceived as an important parameter in a pre-established time of infusion. All these conditions are extremely important to get the results we have. We worked for decades in order to improve these techniques and this is how we differentiate ourselves from others.\"\n</p><p>Notice how they don\u2019t mention even a single example. \n</p><p>An oncologist also contacted me after my post and let me know that there had been reason in the past for her to contact Drs. Siller and Garcia and ask them what they use. The response revealed that they used cisplatin 1 mg, cetuximab 15 mg, doxorubicin 0.25 mg, and Avastin 12.5 mg. Cetuximab interferes with the activity of the epidermal growth factor receptor, and is most commonly used for cancers like colorectal cancer and head-and-neck cancer. It has not been shown to prolong survival in DIPG, at least when combined with irinotecan. Avastin, of course, is an antiangiogenic agent (a drug that inhibits the ingrowth of new blood vessels by the tumor to feed itself). Results of a phase II trial testing it plus irinotecan against recurrent DIPG were disappointing as well, with no responses.\n</p><p>I also can\u2019t help but note that these doses are very low. For instance, a typical dose of Avastin is between 5-15 mg/kg every three weeks. For a typical child weighing 10-20 kg, we\u2019re looking at a dose that could be as much as 20 times lower than recommended. (That\u2019s leaving aside the fact that Avastin has not been FDA-approved for use in children, as far as I can tell, thus showing that Drs. Siller and Garcia are not being entirely accurate when they say they only use FDA-approved medication.) \n</p><p>Similarly, it\u2019s been pointed out to me that the doses of doxorubicin and cisplatin are even lower. For instance, a dose of cisplatin in children for brain tumors off-label is around 60 mg/m2. (This is body surface area, or BSA, based dosing.) A typical three year old girl at the 50th percentile would be 95 cm tall and weigh around 14 kg, requiring a dose of 26 mg. Similarly, doxorubicin is normally dosed in children between 35-75 mg/m2. These are very low doses. \n</p><p>Now, an argument can be made that if you\u2019re injecting it intra-arterially into the tumor you can achieve drug levels in the tumor high enough to do the job; that\u2019s kind of the idea. However, does anyone think that Drs. Siller and Garcia actually did the difficult pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies in animals and humans necessary to determine these lower doses? ...If they did do the work and didn\u2019t publish the results, then that\u2019s arguably just as bad because they\u2019re keeping important information secret.\n</p><p>Basically, when you sum it up, the results of clinical trials of chemotherapy for DIPG have been very disappointing. So, basically, what we have here are several chemotherapeutic agents with no documented significant demonstrable activity against DIPG. I also note that this oncologist strongly suspected that Dr. Siller was not revealing the entire regimen, noting that either that was the case or they have incredibly expensive suppliers for their medication. \n</p><p>She also noted that even what was revealed was considerably more toxic than palliative radiation therapy, which is undeniably true. (Review articles that I read noted a fairly high incidence of bleeding into the tumor as a complication of some of these chemotherapy agents.) \n</p><p>And then, another person who\u2019s had interaction with Dr. Siller wrote me and gave me a more comprehensive list dating to last year. The list includes trade name, generic name, and the process that the drug inhibits:\n</p><p>Zaltrap (ziv-Aflibercept) (VEGF, angiogenesis)\nLaedemab (Nimotuzumab) (EGFR)\nCamptoop (Topotecan) (Topoisomerase)\nOpdivo (Nivolumab) (PD-1)\nAvastin (VEGF, angiogenesis)\nTrixilem (Methotrexate) (dihydrofolate reductase)\nJevtana (Cabazitaxel) (Microtubule inhibitor)\nYervoy (Ipilimumab) (CTLA-4)\nAdriamycin (Doxorubicin) (topoisomerase, histone eviction)\nBlastolem (Cisplatin) (DNA replication)\n</p><p>Some of those drugs are old and not very expensive (e.g., methotrexate, doxorubicin), but some of them are new and damned expensive (e.g. Opdivo). Some of them are also redundant. Also, the more drugs you add, the more chances there are for adverse reactions, unexpected interactions, and synergistic toxicity. My jaw dropped when I read this full list. \n</p><p>Yes, it is possible that these chemotherapy agents, particularly injected right into the arteries leading to the brainstem, could produce responses in terms of tumor shrinkage, but only at the cost of significant toxicity. Let\u2019s also not forget that these are children, some of whom are toddlers. Every time they undergo intra-arterial chemotherapy, they have to undergo general anesthesia. Let\u2019s also not forget that each time they undergo intra-arterial chemotherapy, a large catheter has to be introduced into the femoral artery and guided to the proper arteries under fluoroscopy. The children also undergo repeated lumbar punctures to introduce the drugs intrathecally (into the cerebrospinal fluid that bathes the brain and central nervous system).\n</p><p>So what\u2019s different about this protocol? The answer I find on the IDOI FAQ:\n</p><p>\"IA treatment has been tried before what is the difference this time round?\nCertainly the treatment by this route (intra-arterial) has been tried in the past and still they do it in certain places. What makes it different is the preparation, mixing, dosing and sequential administration of the different drugs that make up our treatment model. We also use the intrathecal route to administer certain drugs.\n</p><p>It\u2019s entirely possible that infusing toxic chemotherapy and targeted therapy directly into the arteries feeding the tumor and into the cerebrospinal fluid could cause a DIPG to shrink. The problem, however, is the counterintuitive experience over many decades that tell oncologists that initial tumor response/shrinkage does not necessarily mean improved overall survival. \n</p><p>clinics like Cl\u00ednica 0-19 are subject to survivor bias, in which we hear about the patients who do better than expected but not so much (more like nothing, really) about patients who do average or worse than expected. \n</p><p>the patients he treats, particularly those from Australia and the UK, can all withstand repeated long trips to Mexico, which suggests that they are in better shape physiologically than the average DIPG patient, and they come from families who either can afford the $300,000 in charges or can raise that much money rapidly. One would expect that these patients as a group would be likely to do better than average anyway.\n</p><p>this parent, as angry as she might have been at me and as much as she thought she had a \u201cgotcha\u201d moment, filled me in:\n</p><p>\"Furthermore, their immunotherapy is also not done at the clinic. The blood is sent to a lab at the University of Monterrey, the white and red blood cells are separated and dendritic T Cells are added, which are closely monitored by published Doctor Cristina Rodriguez and her chemists. Once matured, which takes 7 days, they are transported to Hospitale Angeles where they are infused back into the child\u2019s body during their treatment.\"\n</p><p>First, I found out that there is no faculty with that name at the University of Monterrey. However, there is a Mar\u00eda Cristina Rodr\u00edguez Padilla, PhD at the University of Nuevo Leon who looks as though she fits the description based on her CV and university webpage.\n</p><p>this sounds like the right Prof. Cristina Rodr\u00edguez, although I can\u2019t be 100% sure. Certainly she appears to have the right qualifications.\n</p><p>But dendritic cells? Seriously? This is 1990s technology. \n</p><p>Basically, dendritic cells are antigen-presenting cells. Their main function is to process antigen and then present it on their cell surfaces to T cells. This makes them a crucial component of the mechanism by which vaccines generate specific immune responses. Methods for exploiting dendritic cells to treat cancer generally include either stimulating them to accentuate their anticancer activity or to remove them, stimulate them in a test tube outside of the body, and then reinfuse them. There are a variety of strategies for achieving this stimulation. Without knowing exactly what it is that Rodr\u00edguez is doing, it\u2019s hard to figure out how likely she is to be successful.\n</p><p>Dendritic cells as a strategy for cancer immunotherapy are still under study, but results have been disappointing, with classic objective tumour response rates rarely exceeding 15%. More importantly, there are very few data on dendritic cells as a potential treatment for DIPG. The most recent study I could find was this one from Spain, which concluded nothing more than that it was possible to use dendritic cells to generate a DIPG-specific immune response. That\u2019s not to say that combining some form of dendritic cell vaccination with other therapies might not end up being effective, but in DIPG at least this strategy is in its infancy, with what can at best be described as potential proof-of-principle studies published. Using dendritic cells along with intra-arterial chemotherapy without a lot more clinical and preclinical data is not justified scientifically. In fact, it\u2019s downright unethical.\n</p><p>As for Prof. Rodr\u00edguez-Padilla, I was hard-pressed to find anything on PubMed that resembles what she is supposed to be doing with dendritic cells and DIPG. There are no publications by her on DIPG, and there is only one publication by her involving dendritic cells and AIDS. She isn\u2019t even the first author, either. She does have papers on immunotherapy and cancer, though. (Oddly enough, she\u2019s also co-author on an article about the psychological effects of group hypnotherapy on breast cancer patients during chemotherapy.) \n</p><p>\"In order to get a list of medications used you will need to set up a call because the treatment is tailored to the child\u2019s tumor and needs, and your child\u2019s medical history. He uses multiple drugs and it\u2019s the delivery method that is important as well, not just the medications used. The medication is based around the tumor. Again, if you are wanting to know more about treatment protocol you will need to call the clinic and set up a conference call.\"\n</p><p>\"Below you will find a post with the most recent info on the treatment and pricing by by [sic] a DIPG mom who inquired with the clinic and kindly shared the info in a post for other parents. Generally parents have said to expect each treatment and trip to be around $20,000. Please read:\"\n</p><p>\u201cDr Siller and Dr Garcia have been doing IA treatment for 18-20 years on various brain tumors. Different drugs are used for different tumor types and makeup. It is not a one size fits all situation. The newest drugs are producing more advanced results. Over the years he has had children with different brain tumors reach NED. The longest one is at 5 years and they are in observation still. They do regular visits with their local Onc and Dr Siller and Garcia, They [sic] are in school full time and not on steroids. With the current program of drugs for DIPG, and immunotherapy, there is a lot of promise to be able to reach NED. They are currently working with their local hospital to have it accept out of country insurance. As in they will work with your insurance company for payments.This has not gone through yet but they are hoping it will soon.\n</p><p>\"Pricing: 15-17K USD. Breakdown \u2013 \n$7500 for professional fees for Dr Siller and his entire team in total. \n$3500 negotiated for the drugs with the pharmacy. \nTotal of $11000 USD to be paid up front prior to appointment confirmation. \nAfter that $5000-6000 for ICU/Procedure/MRI before procedure to be paid to hospital. \nImmunotherapy: typically would begin after multiple cycles and off steroids for a few months. This is an IA and cervical lymph node infusion. They require 200 ml of blood to get dendritic and other cells. This varies from IOZK immunotherapy. This is $10,000 USD and is through the local immunotherapy clinic. \n</p><p>\"You initially will plan for 4-6 weeks of stay. If you are deemed well you can leave as soon as possible however you must be fully functional. After the initial visit you will return every 3 weeks, for the $15-17K every time until NED is reached. For IA and Immunotherapy together you can expect to spend about $33,000+ (that\u2019s just for treatments) each time (\u00a325,000).\"\n</p><p>as this post puts it:\n</p><p>\"Medication is administered to the brain stem Basilar &amp; Femoral arteries. The procedure is performed minimum every 17 days. An MRI will be taken before each IA procedure to allow them to see how the tumor has reacted and tailor the following treatment. 2 insertions are made, one in the groin and one in the back. Children are taken straight to ICU after then moved into a private room. The amount of nights/days in the hospital will depend on how your child recovers. Children also have a pediatric doctor assigned to them while in the hospital. You will need to have access to \u201cI-translate\u201d as most of the nurses and hospital staff don\u2019t speak English. You pay for every little thing you need, everything. You are required to pay a deposit when you arrive at the hospital and then pay the remainder before they discharge you. They accept Credit/debit cards and cash.\"\n</p><p>In that very same Facebook post listing the costs and providing information for families, we learn this:\n</p><p>\"The treatment is Intra-arterial Chemotherapy Infusion Treatments and immunotherapy. They do immunotherapy but the child has to be totally off any steroids for several months.\"\n</p><p>I listed another reason above why these children with DIPG treated through Cl\u00ednica 0-19 are likely to be in better shape physiologically than the average DIPG patient. Here\u2019s another. They have to be off steroids, not just briefly but for several months. Any child with DIPG who can be off steroids for several months had a tumor that responded very well to radiation therapy and remained dormant for quite some time and/or is a more indolent, slow-growing variety of DIPG.\n</p><p>Speaking of conventional therapy, here\u2019s another disturbing aspect of IDOI\u2019s protocol that I didn\u2019t mention last week:\n</p><p>\"It is preferred that the child has NOT had radiation before IA treatment, but is not required. They will treat children who have had radiation and have even treated children who have had it twice. After treatment \u2013 The child may experience headaches, sickness, fever, backache, groin pain, and loss of appetite immediately after treatment.\"\n</p><p>On the IDOI FAQ:\n</p><p>\"What are your thoughts on radiation?\nUsually we do not indicate radiotherapy in our patients, when we come to need it (very occasionally), we indicate it in a particular way in an attempt of being the least aggressive with healthy brain tissues around the tumor.\n</p><p>Can we get treatment without doing radiation?\nYes, that would be ideal. For us, radiation is the last choice.\"\n</p><p>Most patients who end up at Cl\u00ednica 0-19 appear to have already had radiation therapy and then shown evidence of recurrence, the recurrence being what drives parents to seek out alternatives. However, telling parents that they should forego radiation therapy in favor of an unproven treatment, saving it for absolutely the last resort while Drs. Siller and Garcia subject their child to their unproven, invasive, and potentially toxic therapy, is the height of irresponsibility.\n</p><p>All the red flags are there: a highly secretive clinic whose doctors won\u2019t publish their protocol or even survival statistics; charging families enormous sums of money, cash on the barrelhead; no science to support their claims; and a network of patients and supporters who both sell the clinic\u2019s treatment through their testimonials and attack critics. That is Burzynski\u2019s model. It is also the Hallwang Clinic\u2019s model. It is Cl\u00ednica 0-19\u2019s model.\n</p><p><br />\n</p>\n<ul><li>* *</li></ul>\n<p><sup id=\"cite_ref-SBM3&quot;_7-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-SBM3&quot;-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>This is the conclusion of my series on Cl\u00ednica 0-19, the cancer clinic where Drs. Alberto Siller and Alberto Garcia see patients with DIPG, a deadly brain tumor, whom they treat at Hospital Angeles in Monterrey Mexico with an unproven combination of intra-arterial chemotherapy with up to 11 drugs and a poorly defined dendritic cell immunotherapy. \n</p><p>What Drs. Alberto Siller and Alberto Garcia are doing through their Instituto de Oncolog\u00eda Intervencionista (IDOI, or the Institute of Interventional Oncology) at Hospital Angeles involves more invasive treatments than Burzynski\u2019s, including multiple cerebral angiographies (with the attendant sedations and anesthesias necessary) and the injection of up to 11 toxic chemotherapy drugs directly into the brain. \n</p><p>Based on what I learned of the protocol, this treatment is highly improbable, with doses of chemotherapy too low to do anything even accounting for being injected directly into the arteries leading to the brainstem and a dendritic cell-based immunotherapy that can\u2019t possibly result in a sufficient number of dendritic cells to do anything. \n</p><p>Addy Joy Sooter, \n</p><p>four year old girl from Arkansas who recently died of DIPG after an 18 month course\n</p><p>Annabelle Nguyen, \n</p><p>Here is what happened beginning in August 2015:  Annabelle was diagnosed with DIPG less than a month before her 3rd birthday. Her parents noticed that she was walking differently, wobbling from side-to-side and leaning forward. She also initiated a new bedtime routine of screaming and rubbing her eyes uncontrollably.\n</p><p>They were living in Vietnam at the time, and Annabelle\u2019s first MRI was inconclusive, so they flew to Australia for an emergency follow up scan, which showed a tumor in her brainstem. The medical care in Australia was par for the course for DIPG treatment: radiation, and wait for the inevitable. Annabelle completed 30 rounds of radiation, and then the family returned to Vietnam, where Annabelle\u2019s father Trung took a job with the family business.\n</p><p>While living in Vietnam, Annabelle was treated using acupuncture, Chinese medicine, and qigong. She\u2019d been faring quite well, until a routine scan in May showed that Annabelle was in progression. .\n</p><p>They learned about Mexico the way a lot of other families have\u2014through social media. After selling most of their belongings to afford the first treatments, Sandy brought Annabelle to Monterrey, leaving Trung and Annabelle\u2019s 2-year-old sister Alyssa behind. They arrived in Mexico on May 22nd, and Annabelle had had two IA treatments and one immunotherapy at the time we visited with them.\n</p><p>The fundraising happens on Facebook. It happens on GoFundMe. It happens in the media, particularly in tabloids like the Daily Mail, which frequently post glowing stories about children like Nguyen that help their families to raise still more money. \n</p><p>Then, early this year, stories started appearing about Annabelle, stories like \u201cAustralian girl, 5, is miraculously HEALED of cancer thanks to revolutionary treatment in Mexico after doctors gave her just weeks to live when she was diagnosed with an \u2018incurable\u2019 brain tumour.\u201d (Yes, it\u2019s the Daily Mail.) \n</p><p>I\u2019m not a neuroradiologist, but first of all there are nowhere near enough images to tell whether the tumor has responded to treatment. Second, there\u2019s no way of knowing that what happened with Amelia\u2019s tumor isn\u2019t what\u2019s happening here. Yes, it\u2019s better to have low (or no) PET activity on a PET-CT scan than to have high activity. However, there are a lot of caveats. MRI is the preferred diagnostic imaging test, because, as is explained here, the findings on CT scan can be rather subtle. \n</p><p>Contrast enhancement is seen in the minority of DIPG, and when present is typically mild. There may be some indication of necrosis, and the basilar artery is commonly engulfed by tumor. Hemorrhage and calcification are uncommon.\n</p><p>In other words, these tumors typically don\u2019t light up a lot on MRI. So, basically, these images don\u2019t tell us anything one way or the other about whether the treatment worked. Yet Dr. Siller told the family:\n</p><p>Here it is: The tumor that was in Annabelle\u2019s pons is no longer visible on any scan, and there is ZERO tumor activity anywhere in her brain. Because of some residual inflammation, they are not able to say for certain that there is no evidence of disease (NED), but they did say that this is the \u201cmost perfect report they have seen.\u201d\n</p><p>Can you imagine the horrible burden that was laid on Annabelle\u2019s parents in late January? Because of Dr. Siller, they truly believed that their daughter was cured of an incurable brain tumor but that if they stopped the treatment the cancer would come back and she would die. \n</p><p>Even if the CT-PET scan were as Dr. Siller claimed, how do they know how long to continue the treatments? They don\u2019t, because they haven\u2019t done anything even resembling a clinical trial. \n</p><p>Three months later, Annabelle\u2019s symptoms started worsening again and she started becoming hypoxic.\n</p><p>Basically, Annabelle\u2019s tumor had recurred\u2014again, I doubt that she was ever rendered NED\u2014and begun to progress, with an additional tumor in her pons, and both tumors extending into her cerebellum. What did Dr. Siller and Garcia want to do?\n</p><p>In our discussion with the doctors about our next steps, they said that they want to move her treatments up to every three weeks. They feel confident that they can get the tumors under control by doing this.\n</p><p>Based on what evidence did they want to do this? Again, none. Any competent oncologist would at this point recommend switching to palliative care, to spare the child as much suffering as possible, but not Dr. Siller. \n</p><p>poor Annabelle became unresponsive and needed the surgical insertion of a shunt to drain the fluid accumulating in her brain\u2019s ventricles. After the procedure, she was basically unresponsive, in a coma. She underwent an EEG, which showed very low activity. A few days later, Annabelle suffered a collapsed lung, most likely a ventilator-related complication:\n</p><p>A week and a half after her treatment, Annabelle underwent another CT scan:\n</p><p>According to her mom, this showed widespread inflammation.\n</p><p>Meanwhile, the bills kept coming in, $18,000 for the shunt surgery and her time in the ICU up to that point, with, as I mentioned last week, $2,500 per day in hospital charges.\n</p><p>Parker Monhollon\n</p><p>Parker Monhollon was a girl from Silver Lake, Kansas, who was diagnosed with DIPG at age 8 in January 2016 and, sadly, passed away almost exactly a year ago in Monterrey. I\u2019m presenting her case because she suffered quite a few complications during the course of her treatments, thus illustrating that Dr. Siller\u2019s treatments are not only unproven and very likely ineffective, but also not benign. \n</p><p>About a week before Christmas, 2015 Amanda and Danny started to notice that Parker\u2019s eyes were looking different, the left one would stray toward the nose when it should\u2019t [sic] be. Amanda had the eye appointment made for January 19, 2016. Meanwhile Parker\u2019s school nurse had contacted Amanda about concerns with Parkers vision. The next week the school nurse called again and her and Amanda both agreed that Parker\u2019s eyes looked worse and Parker had complained of headache and some double vision by now. Amanda was able to get her in to see Dr. Hefner on Tuesday January 12, 2016 and he told Amanda his recommendation is an MRI, to just rule out anything and then hopefully start vision therapy and possibly an eye surgery if needed.\n</p><p>The MRI was finally done on January 15, 2016. \n</p><p>A Brain Tumor was the diagnosis. The next day, Saturday January 16, 2016 we received the news of the type of brain tumor, a DIPG. \n</p><p>Parker underwent radiation at St. Jude\u2019s Hospital, immunotherapy in Germany, a biopsy of her tumor at UCSF\u2014which ended up disturbing the cells and spreading the cancer to her spine, and re-radiation beginning in October of 2016. \n</p><p>Notice how puffy she\u2019s become, almost certainly from a lot of steroids. Of course, this makes me wonder if at this time Dr. Siller still required patients to have been off steroids for months before he would treat them. It turns out that she was on a steroid taper when this happened:\n</p><p>There was leakage from around the stitches of her Ommaya reservoir. An Ommaya reservoir is a catheter system for infusing drugs into the cerebrospinal fluid. It involves a semi-permanent catheter and a reservoir placed beneath the scalp that can be accessed much like a Mediport. the reservoir became infected:\n</p><p>Of course, Parker didn\u2019t need an Ommya for the simple reason that there\u2019s no good evidence that the Cl\u00ednica 0-19 protocol is effective and no good clinical trial evidence that using such a system to infuse chemotherapy prolongs the lives of DIPG patients. Consequently, this was an unnecessary complication.\n</p><p>Parker was basically in the hospital for three weeks without having had any treatment for her cancer because of the complications from the Ommaya reservoir that required placement of an external shunt, and she was having problems with her Mediport, which had been placed a year before, to the point where it had to be replaced. Then, she developed pneumonia and had to be placed on a ventilator, and her left eye couldn\u2019t be closed all the way:\n</p><p>Unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t long before Parker developed a recurrent pneumonia:\n</p><p>By then, the hospital bill had climbed to six figures. While this is much less than the bill would have been for such a stay in a US hospital, health insurance wouldn\u2019t cover this, leaving the family on the hook for the whole bill. Interestingly, the doctors there decided to do a tracheotomy, G-tube, and Nissen fundoplication to address her recurrent pneumonias. \n</p><p>The last two posts are beyond sad. The family was still in Mexico. Their daughter had deteriorated, suffering many complications that had cascaded from the initial insult from the infection of the Ommaya reservoir. On July 5, 2017, Parker\u2019s mother Amanda posted that she basically knew her daughter was going to die. \n</p><p>In this video, Ms. Monholland revealed that Parker no longer had any brain activity (i.e., she was apparently brain dead) but that the hospital wouldn\u2019t disconnect the life support because, according to her, Mexico doesn\u2019t allow advanced directives or Do Not Resuscitate orders. That meant, according to here, that they were just going to wait until Parker\u2019s heart stopped.\n</p><p>Doing a little searching, I discovered that it\u2019s not true that Mexico doesn\u2019t have a law permitting advanced directives (it passed one in 2008) but that it is true that the law is not well known. It is also true that palliative care is a big problem in Mexico, with few public healthcare institutions offering it, particularly for children. \n</p><p>Parker died the next day.\n</p><p>I also learned from someone who wrote me that Dr. Siller does not like patients\u2019 parents who are a bit too\u2026inquisitive. Basically the story that was related was that a relative had a child with DIPG and went to Cl\u00efnica 0-19 for a consultation. Here\u2019s the story as related to me in an email with permission to post it as long as I anonymized everything:\n</p><p>Prior to my relative travelling to Mexico I assisted him in preparing a list of approx 20 questions for Drs Siller and Garcia including requesting details of all the drugs that would be administered, specific outcome data on all patients they had treated, why their results weren\u2019t published etc etc. The final question was on the ethics of withholding their treatment protocol from international colleagues and thereby precluding children being treated in their own countries without the costs and social disruption frequent trips to Monterrey entail. The answers to the questions were grossly inadequate and the final question made Dr Siller annoyed. My nephew, a lawyer, decided this treatment was not appropriate for his daughter and they returned to Australia. His daughter died in January this year.\n</p><p>All of these questions were entirely appropriate. If Dr. Siller can\u2019t or won\u2019t answer them for potential patients, he cannot be said to be giving them true informed consent, which is also incredibly arrogant, paternalistic, and unethical, so much so that I strongly suspect that Drs. Siller and Garcia know that what they\u2019re doing is ethically unacceptable and quite possibly know that their treatment does no better for DIPG than conventional therapy and possibly even worse.\n</p><p><br />\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a
