Seasilver is the trademarked name of a commercial dietary supplement  produced and sold by the companies Seasilver USA, Inc. and Americaloe, Inc.  The product was promoted with the false claim that it could "cure 650 diseases", resulting in the prosecution and fining of the companies' owners.  In 2002 the US Food and Drug Administration sent a warning letter to the product's promoters for making unsubstantied health claims.   In 2003 US$5.6 million worth of product was seized by the FDA  and in the following year the company owners were issued with an order banning them for falsely promoting the Seasilver product, and fining them US$120 million, suspended to US$3 million if the fine was paid promptly.  Following non-payment and a failed appeal, the full fine of US$120 million was re-affirmed by a ruling in 2008.  The Seasilver product includes a variety of ingredients including pau d'arco, cranberry and aloe. According to the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, "no studies have shown the efficacy of this costly product",  and Quackwatch say there is "no logical reason to use the product".
