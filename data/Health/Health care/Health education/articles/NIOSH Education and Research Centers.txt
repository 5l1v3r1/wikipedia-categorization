NIOSH Education and Research Centers are multidisciplinary centers supported by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health for education and research in the field of occupational health. Through the centers, NIOSH supports academic degree programs, research, continuing education, and outreach.  The ERCs, distributed in regions across the United States, establish academic, labor, and industry research partnerships.  The research conducted at the centers is related to the National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) established by NIOSH.  Founded in 1977, NIOSH ERCs are responsible for nearly half of post-baccalaureate graduates entering occupational health and safety fields. The ERCs focus on core academic disciplines of industrial hygiene, occupational health nursing, occupational medicine, occupational safety, and other areas of specialization listed below by center.  At many ERCs, students in specific disciplines have their tuition paid in full and receive additional stipend money.  ERCs provide a benefit to local businesses by offering reduced price assessments and training. Source: 2011-12 ERC Annual Reports
