The first explicit published reference to the term appears in a paper published in 1969 by Landoll and Caceres.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> Cesar A. Caceres, a cardiologist, is generally credited with coining the term <i>clinical engineering</i>.  Of course, the broader field of biomedical engineering has a relatively recent history as well. The first modern professional intersociety engineering meeting to be focused on the application of engineering in medicine was probably held in 1948, according to the Alliance for Engineering in Medicine and Biology.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The general notion of the application of engineering to medicine can be traced back centuries; for example, <a href=\"/wiki/Stephen_Hales\" title=\"Stephen Hales\">Stephen Hales</a>'s work in the early 18th century which led to the invention of a ventilator and the discovery of blood pressure certainly involved the application of engineering techniques to medicine.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The recent history of this sub-discipline is somewhat erratic. In the early 1970s, clinical engineering was thought to be a field that would require many new professionals. Estimates for the US ranged as high as 5,000 to 8,000 clinical engineers, or five to ten clinical engineers for every 250,000 of population, or one clinical engineer per 250 hospital beds.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The history of its formal credentialization and accreditation procedures has also been somewhat unstable. The International Certification Commission for Clinical Engineers (ICC) was formed under the sponsorship of the <a href=\"/wiki/Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Medical_Instrumentation\" title=\"Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation\">Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation</a> (AAMI) in the early 1970s, to provide a formal certification process for clinical engineers. A similar certification program was formed by academic institutions offering graduate degrees in clinical engineering as the American Board of Clinical Engineering (ABCE). In 1979, the ABCE agreed to dissolve, and those certified under its program were accepted into the ICC certification program. By 1985, only 350 clinical engineers had become certified.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> Finally, in 1999, the AAMI after lengthy deliberation, and analysis of a 1998 survey demonstrating that there was not a viable market for its certification program decided to suspend that program, no longer accepting any new applicants as of July 1999.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The new, current clinical engineering certification (CCE) program was started in 2002 under the sponsorship of the American College of Clinical Engineering (ACCE), and is administered by the ACCE Healthcare Technology Foundation. In 2004, the first year that the certification process was actually underway, 112 individuals were granted certification based upon their previous ICC certification, and three individuals were awarded the new certification.<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> By the time of the publication of the 2006-2007 AHTF Annual Report (c. June 30, 2007), a total of 147 individuals were included in the ranks of HTF certified clinical engineers.<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"New_name_for_the_profession\">New name for the profession</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Clinical_engineering&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: New name for the profession\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In 2011, AAMI arranged a meeting to discuss a new name for clinical engineering and/or <a href=\"/wiki/Biomedical_Equipment_Technician\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Biomedical Equipment Technician\">biomedical equipment technology</a>.  After careful debate, the vast majority decided on \"Healthcare Technology Management\".  Due partly to common confusion about the line between clinical engineers (engineers) and BMETs (technicians), the word <i>engineering</i> was deemed limiting from the administrator's perspective and unworkable from the educator's perspective.  (An ABET-accredited college could not name an associate degree program \"engineering\".)  Also, the adjective <i>clinical</i> limited the scope to hospitals.  It remains unresolved how widely or officially accepted this change is or will be, and how this will affect Clinical Engineering Certification (CCE) or the formal recognition of clinical engineering as a subset of <a href=\"/wiki/Biomedical_engineering\" title=\"Biomedical engineering\">biomedical engineering</a>. For <a href=\"/wiki/Regulation_and_licensure_in_engineering\" title=\"Regulation and licensure in engineering\">regulatory and licensure reasons</a> true engineering specialities must be definable in a way that distinguishes them from technicians with whom they work.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Definition\">Definition</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Clinical_engineering&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Definition\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>A clinical engineer is defined by the ACCE as \"a professional who supports and advances patient care by applying engineering and managerial skills to healthcare technology.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>  This definition was first adopted by the ACCE Board of Directors on May 13, 1991.  Clinical engineering is also recognized by the Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES), the major professional organization for biomedical engineering, as being a branch within biomedical engineering. <sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>There are at least two issues with the ACCE definition that cause some confusion. First, it is phrased so broadly that it's not readily evident that \"clinical engineer\" is a subset of \"biomedical engineer\". Many times the terms are used interchangeably: some hospitals refer to their relevant departments as \"Clinical Engineering\" departments, while others call them \"Biomedical Engineering\" departments. Indeed, as noted above, the <i>technicians</i> are almost universally referred to as \"biomedical equipment technicians,\" regardless of the name of the department that they might work under. However, the term <i>biomedical engineer</i> is generally thought to be more all-encompassing, including engineers who work in the primary design of medical devices for manufacturers, or in original R&amp;D, or in academia\u2014whereas clinical engineers generally work in hospitals solving problems that are very close to where equipment is actually used in a patient care setting. The clinical engineers in some countries such as India are trained to innovate and find technological solutions for the clinical needs.<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> The other issue not evident from the ACCE definition is the appropriate educational background for a clinical engineer. Generally, the expectation of the certification program is that an applicant for certification as a clinical engineer will hold an accredited bachelor's degree in engineering (or at least engineering technology).\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_future\">The future</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Clinical_engineering&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: The future\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The management of healthcare technology is becoming increasingly complex.<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Degree_programs\">Degree programs</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Clinical_engineering&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Degree programs\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The University of Connecticut offers a two-year clinical engineering internship program where students work part-time as clinical engineers during the Fall and Spring semester at a hospital in New England.

Clinical engineering is a modality of the clinical scientist profession, registered by the <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.hcpc-uk.org\">HCPC</a>.  The responsibilities of clinical engineers are varied, and can include providing specialist clinical services, inventing and developing medical devices, and medical device management.    The roles typically involve both patient contact and academic research.    Clinical engineering units within an NHS organisation are often part of a larger medical physics department.   Clinical engineers, are supported and represented by the Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine (IPEM), within which the clinical engineering special interest group oversees the engineering activities.  The three primary aims of Clinical Engineering with the NHS are:\n</p>\n<ol><li>To ensure medical equipment in the clinical environment is available and appropriate to the <i>needs of the clinical service</i>.</li>\n<li>To ensure medical equipment functions <i>effectively and safely.</i></li>\n<li>To ensure medical equipment and its management represents <i>value for patient benefit</i>:</li></ol>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Skills_required\">Skills required</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Clinical_engineering&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Skills required\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Clinical engineering supports a broad range of healthcare activities, and therefore the specific person requirements for the role are equally varied.  However clinical scientist must be able to work with patients, clinical staff and a range of other professionals, therefore being able to communicate often in complex situations appropriately is essential.   As a scientist you will be required to keep up to date with advances in your area, and will often have the opportunity to communicate research and development to others.    Clinical engineers will have a scientific first degree (often engineering or physics) before going on to train and register as a clinical scientist., and many also are educated to a doctoral level, either as part of their clinical engineering training, or prior to training.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Registration_in_the_UK\">Registration in the UK</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Clinical_engineering&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: Registration in the UK\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Clinical engineers are registered as clinical scientists by the <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.hcpc-uk.org\">HCPC</a>.   Assessment of trainees prior to registration is provided by the Association of Clinical Scientists (ACS) and the Academy of Healthcare Science (AHCS).   There are two programmes for attaining registration from the HCPC as a clinical scientist.   The first is a Certificate of Attainment, awarded on successful completion of the NHS Scientist Training Programme (STP), and the second is through the Certificate of Equivalence, awarded on successful demonstration of equivalence to the STP.   This second route is normally chosen by individuals that have significant scientific experience prior to seeking registration.

This was aimed at indigenous biomedical device development as well as technology management, and thereby contribute to the overall development of healthcare delivery in the country.\n</p><p>During the course, students of engineering are given an insight into biology, medicine, relevant electronic background, clinical practices, device development and even management aspects. Additionally, students are paired with clinical doctors from CMC and SCTIMST to get hands-on experience during internships. An important aspect of this training is simultaneous, long term and detailed exposure to clinical environment as well as to medical device development activity. This is aimed at making students understand the process of identifying unmet clinical needs and thus, contributing to the development of new medical devices in the country. A unique feature of the course is clinical attachment which exposes the students to the clinical environment. The program also trains engineers to manage and ensure safe and effective use of technology in health care delivery points.\n</p><p>The minimum qualification for joining this course is a bachelor's
