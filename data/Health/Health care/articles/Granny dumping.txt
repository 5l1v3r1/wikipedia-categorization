Granny dumping (informal) is a term that was introduced in the early 1980s and is defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as "the abandonment of an elderly person in a public place such as a hospital or nursing home, especially by a relative."  It may be carried out by family members who are unable or unwilling to continue providing care due to financial problems, tiredness, or stress.  The phenomenon is not new.  A practice, known as ubasute, had allegedly existed in Japan centuries ago when senile elders were brought to mountaintops by poor citizens who were unable to look after them. The widespread economic and demographic problems facing Japan have seen it on the rise with relatives dropping off seniors at hospitals or charities.  70,000 elderly Americans were estimated to have been abandoned in 1992 in a report issued by the American College of Emergency Physicians. Social workers have said that this may be the result of millions of people who are near the breaking point of looking after their elderly parents who are in poor health.  Incidents of granny dumping can happen before long weekends and may peak before Christmas when families head off on holidays. Caregivers in both Australia and New Zealand report that old people without acute medical problems are dropped off at hospitals. As a result, hospitals and care facilities have to carry an extra burden on their limited resources.
