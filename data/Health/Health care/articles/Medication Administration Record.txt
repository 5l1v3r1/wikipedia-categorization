A Medication Administration Record  or MAR (eMAR for electronic versions) is the report that serves as a legal record of the drugs administered to a patient at a facility by a health care professional.  The MAR is a part of a patient's permanent record on their medical chart. The health care professional signs off on the record at the time that the drug or device is administered. MARs are commonly referred to as drug charts. The actual chart varies from hospital to hospital and country to country. However they are typically of the format: A kardex (plural kardexes) is a genericised trademark for a medication administration record.   The term is common in Ireland and the United Kingdom. In the Philippines, the term is used to refer the old census charts of the charge nurse usually used during endorsement, in which index cards are used, but has been gradually been replaced by modern health data systems and pre-printed charts and forms.
