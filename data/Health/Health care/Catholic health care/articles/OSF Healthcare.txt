OSF HealthCare is a not-for-profit Catholic health care corporation that operates a medical group, hospital system, and other health care facilities in Illinois and Michigan.   Headquartered in Peoria, Illinois, OSF HealthCare is owned and operated by the Sisters of the Third Order of St. Francis.  The sisters arrived in Iowa City, Iowa in 1875 from Germany.  At the request of Rev. Bernard Baak in Peoria, Illinois, six sisters were sent there to care for the sick in 1876.  The sisters became an independent religious community in 1877.  A major expansion of OSF Saint Francis Medical Center, the largest of the corporation's hospitals, was completed in 2010. In April 2012, the Sisters dropped a bid to acquire health care corporation in Rockford after the Federal Trade Commission challenged the merger as anti-competitive.   Also, in April 2012, Sister Judith Ann Duvall gave an interview to the Peoria Journal Star, and emphasized that charitable aid, not solely profit, was the core basis for the Order's and OSF HealthCare's existence (though the Peoria hospital is well situated financially, and with a large endowment).   Sister Judith Ann is also the subject of the 2013 documentary Divine Prescription: Stories of Faith, Community and Healing,  produced by Diva Communications. The OSF HealthCare operates acute care facilities.  The system includes thirteen hospitals, two colleges of nursing, and two long-term care facilities.  The OSF Medical Group has 97 locations, and employs 653 primary care providers and 288 specialty care providers.   The OSF Home Care has an average daily census of 198.   OSF Saint Francis, Inc. and OSF Healthcare Foundation are also operated by OSF Healthcare.  OSF HealthCare owns OSF Saint Francis, Inc., comprising health care-related businesses, and OSF HealthCare Foundation, the philanthropic arm of OSF HealthCare.
