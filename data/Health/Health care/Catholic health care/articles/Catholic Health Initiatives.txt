In fiscal year 2014, CHI provided $910 million in charity care and community benefit - a nearly 20% increase over the previous year - for programs and services for the poor, free clinics, education and research. Charity care and community benefit totaled more than $1.7 billion with the inclusion of the unpaid costs of Medicare. The health system, which generated revenues of almost $13.9 billion (FY 2014), has total assets of $21.8 billion. In January 2013, the hospital's defense lawyers provoked controversy by arguing against a wrongful death lawsuit that unborn fetuses should not be classed as persons, contradicting Catholic doctrine.  When the case was submitted to the three bishops of Colorado for review, they issued a joint statement which reiterated their commitment to defending human dignity against attacks.
