Mercury is traditionally used in dental restorations known as amalgam. In October 2013, Australia's Department of the Environment and Energy signed The Minamata Convention in call for the reduction amalgam usage by means of nine measures eventually phasing down the use of amalgam. (3). Mercury can be released into the environment when amalgam is placed, finished and polished or removed from a patient mouth and can be either rinsed into sewage systems or disposed of in landfill. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)#Releases_in_the_environment) By complying with the Australian Dental Association (ADA) Policy 6.11 (4) and the current edition of the International Organization for Standardization ISO11143 Dentistry – Amalgam Separators (5), reducing the amount of mercury entering the environment by means of installing amalgam separators and traps to collect and separate amalgam waste before it enters the sewage system. Amalgam that is collected from traps is then collected and recycled for reuse (6). With the phasing out of manual processing of radiographs and switching to digital radiography allows for practices not having to purchase developing liquids and these liquids are harmful to the environment and need to be collected to be disposed of correctly(4, 6).

Green Dentistry, A Metamorphosis Towards an Eco-Friendly Dentistry: A Short Communication. JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND DIAGNOSTIC RESEARCH. 2014;. BlondeRanga91 (talk) 13:19, 14 May 2018 (UTC)  Eco-friendly dentistry (also called environmentally friendly dentistry, green dentistry or sustainable dentistry) is a sustainability and marketing term that refers to the aim of reducing the detrimental impact of dental services on the environment while still being able to adhere to the regulations and standards of the dental industries in their respective countries. There are no official governing agencies to regulate if an office meets Eco-friendly standards. Dental offices in United States of America can be recognised as an Eco-friendly office by becoming a member of the Eco Dentistry Association.   Green Dentistry has been defined by the Eco Dentistry Association as "a high-tech approach that reduces the environmental impact of dental offices and encompasses a service model for dentistry that supports and maintains wellness. Dental offices apply the concepts of Eco-friendly dentistry by reducing waste in an attempt to have a minimal impact on the environment. Eco-friendly practices have been implemented into many professions & movements.   The term eco-friendly dentistry has roots originating from the Environmental movement and Environmentalism, which, in the Western world, is often perceived as having begun in the 1960’s and 70’s. The rise of this movement is often credited to Rachel Carson , conservationist and author of the book, Silent Spring. Subsequently, legislation in many countries throughout the world began gaining momentum in the 1970s and continues to the present day . The actual beginnings of the movement, in the Western world, can be traced back even further to the intellectuals, philosophers and thinkers of the 1830s and 1840s. Most notable of these is philosopher and Transcendentalist, Henry David Thoreau. These writings have been continually expanded upon into the present day (see Environmental philosophy) .  Eco-friendliness also has meaning in another context as a marketing term. It is used by companies to appeal to consumers of goods and services as having a low impact on the environment.  Market research has found that an increasing number of consumers purchase goods and services that appeal to the values of environmental philosophy . The dental industry has adopted the concept of eco-friendliness both in a well-meaning, philosophical context and as a marketing term so that patients who subscribe to principles of sustainability can choose to visit these offices.  The term has been criticised as being used for ”greenwashing”. Legislation in countries around the world have Trade Comissions and such to stop companies profiting with baseless claims on their goods and services.  Individuals and bodies that work in the dental industry have also subsequently adopted the principals of sustainability and environmentalism and also as an advertisement to patients, clients and consumers. The Eco-dental association is an accreditation organisation in the United States and proposed outcomes towards becoming more sustainable. In 2008, the Eco Dentistry Association was co-founded by Dr. Fred Pockrass and his wife, Ina Pockrass. The Eco-Dentistry Association (EDA) provides "education, standards and connection" to patients and dentists who practice green dentistry. The EDA aims to help dentists "come up with safe and reusable alternatives that lower a dentists' operating cost by replacing paper with digital media whenever possible."  As of February, 2011, the EDA has approximately 600 members. . After the inception of the EDA, the dental industry in America saw more dentists and oral surgeons choosing to make their offices environmentally friendly.  The word eco-friendly was added to the Oxford English Dictionary in March 2008.  In 2011, The Australian Dental Association implemented a policy of sustainability to provide guidelines to assist in the environmental sustainability of dental offices in Australia.   To be environmentally responsible, offices can incorporate the four R's of environmental responsibility. The four R's are: reduce, reuse, recycle & rethink.       Surgery and Laboratory Switching to digital radiography eliminates the generation of soluble silver and lead waste. Both of these substances are leachable toxins which have the propensity to contaminate soil and ground water .  Switching to reusable impression trays to reduces the disposal of single-use trays  . Using compostable or biodegradable barrier bags to cover the dental chair, bracket table and other parts of the surgery  .  Switching to reusable cloth or fabric bags when sterilising instruments instead of using single-use sterilisation pouches  .  Purchasing items in bulk or requesting that your supplier to combine items in order to reduce packaging waste  .  Opt to apply fluoride varnish instead of fluoride trays to reduce usage of singe-use trays  .   Energy and Efficiency Dental offices use a high amount of electricity each and everyday. Unfortunately without electricity an office cannot run. By using technology such as motion sensors can help reduce the amount of electricity used especially when not in use  . Electrical equipment that are not in use should be switched off at the plug, because when left on standby they are still generating power  . Items such as computers that need to be left on, should have monitor turned off to save power  .  In Australia, incandescent light bulbs are being phased out   and more efficient type pf light are being implemented. Using light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) can reduce the amount of energy used for lighting by 50% or more .  Energy Savings Australia have developed an app   and an introductory video   to help Australians make better energy efficient choices.   Using these energy efficient technologies and smarter lighting choices  creates an environmentally sustainable approach that will not only reduced energy bills but also help reduce the dental industry's  carbon footprint  .    Energy Renewables There is a scant amount of solid scientific information regarding the carbon footprint of the dental industry.     The dental office could consider utilisation of solar hot water, solar electricity panels and passive heating/cooling systems in order to reduce carbon emissions.   Waste Minimisation Waste reduction is important in the protection and preservation of the environment. According to WHO  , the dental industry can implement waste minimalization in the following ways:     Reduce purchasing – choosing less hazardous and wasteful materials and supplies •   Use physical cleaning methods instead of chemical •	Order frequently and in small quantities to avoid accumulation of expired products •	Use products in the order of expiry date: oldest to newest  •	Use of all contents within the product  Further research shows that there are many other ways to reduce waste in order to be an eco-friendly. These include:   •   Carpooling to work or send a large amount of lab work at once to reduce the impact of carbon emissions to the environment.    •  Laundering cloth gowns rather than using disposable gowns.   •  Items such as Dappen dishes can be reprocessed.   •  Using scrap paper instead of notepads.     •  Use autoclavable stainless steel impression trays instead of plastic disposable ones.   •  Use instrument sharpening stones instead of disposing dull instruments.   •  Donating old instruments to overseas dental groups / recycling old instruments         E-Measure Having a paperless dental office reduces or eliminates the use of paper by going digital. This involves converting patient files, medical histories and other documentation to an electronic system. Going paperless not only makes information sharing easier and accessible but is a great way of keeping personal information secure. This saves money, boosts productivity and saves space as there is no need for any filing cabinets and is a great way of ensuring clinical records are more accurate.   Using digital radiography allows to keep all the patients records in one spot, reduces the amount of radiation exposure and images and clinical photographs can be shared without losing the quality of the image.

With the phasing out of manual processing of radiographs and switching to digital radiography allows for offices not having to purchase developing liquids and these liquids are harmful to the environment and need to be collected to be disposed of correctly.        Water Management • Installing a water meter to monitor water usage. • Handwashing sinks with motion-activated taps. • Collect the water bills for the last year to benchmark a water usage audit.  • Place interpretive signs about water conservation in staff rooms, toilets and surgeries.  • Maintain and repair taps or fittings .  • Use a non-water-based approach to cleaning where possible.  • Retro flow controllers in key usage areas   • Install 4-, 5- or 6-star water efficient appliances where appropriate.   Dental practices can recycle paper, cardboard, aluminum and plastics from plastic barriers and other water products contributing to sustainable environmentally friendly practices. Autoclave bags can be separated after opening and the paper and plastic recycled separately. To become more eco-friendly or environmentally friendly dental practices can purchase biodegradable products therefore allowing more waste associated with the running of the practice to be recycled. Shredding of paper documents and recycling shredded paper will contribute to sustainable practices. In the dental offices lunch room food scraps can be recycled rather then being placed in the general waster. Leadership & innovation  According  to the Eco Dentistry Association, eco-friendly dentistry involves taking initiative to build a dental environment by sustainable practices and materials. However, eco-friendly dentistry is not bound by only sustainable manufacturing distribution, waste reduction, pollution prevention, energy conservation, water conservation, patient care and workplace policies. Eco-friendly dentistry is about leadership and innovation. Influencing others around them to part-take in the cause. Eco-friendly dentistry needs to be widespread to make a large impact on the environment and on the dental industry. It is important to create and implement educational programs to enlighten others to follow. Eco-friendly dentistry is about being innovative, discovering new ideas and ways to promote environmentally safe practices.
