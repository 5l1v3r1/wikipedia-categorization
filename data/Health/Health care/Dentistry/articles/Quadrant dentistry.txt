Quadrant dentistry is a treatment approach sometimes used in individuals who need much dental treatment. :189,190 Quadrant dentistry means that all the dental treatment required in a quadrant is carried out in a single appointment. This is perceived as convenient for some dentists and some patients, as fewer appointments are required overall. The dentition is divided into quadrants: Inferior alveolar nerve blocks anesthetize all the teeth in a lower quadrant, so it can be convenient as only one injection is required for quadrant dentistry carried out in the lower teeth. Rubber dam is often used in this technique.  If a tooth extraction is carried out in the same appointment as placing an amalgam filling, amalgam tattoo can result.
