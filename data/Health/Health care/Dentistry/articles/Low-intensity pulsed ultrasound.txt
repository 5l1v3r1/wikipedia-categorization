 Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) is a medical technology, generally using 1.5 MHz frequency pulses, with a pulse width of 200 μs, repeated at 1 kHz, at a spatial average and temporal average intensity of 30 mW/cm2.  As of 2009 research for the use of LIPUS to treat soft tissue injuries were in the early stages.  As of 2012 it was being studied for dental problems.  Starting around the 1950s this technology was being used as a form of physical therapy for ailments such as tendinitis.  Low intensity pulsed ultrasound has been proposed as a therapy to support bone healing after fractures, osteotomies, or delayed healing. A 2017 review, however, found no trustworthy evidence for the use of low intensity pulsed ultrasound for bone healing.  An associated guideline issued a strong recommendation against its use in bone healing.  Evidence as of 2014 was insufficient to justify its use to prevent non healing of bone fractures.  Tentative evidence supports better healing with the use of the system in long bones that have not healed after three months.  Some reviews suggested inconclusive evidence of benefit.  One industry supported meta-analysis suggested it as a potential alternative to surgery for established nonunions.  Most studies suggesting benefit were funded by manufacturers of ultrasound devices.  In 2018, a study published in the journal Brain Stimulation, reported that experiments on mice showed that whole-brain LIPUS therapy markedly improved cognitive dysfunctions without serious side effects by enhancing specific cells related to dementia's pathology. Clinical trials are underway.
