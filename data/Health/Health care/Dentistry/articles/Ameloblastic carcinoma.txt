Ameloblastic carcinoma is a rare form of odontogenic tumor, one that develops in the jawbones from the epithelial cells that generate the tooth enamel. Symptoms include swelling in the jaw and pain, both of which get worse as the cancer grows. It is usually treated with surgery; chemotherapy has not been proven to be effective.  Though some people have no symptoms the symptoms that may occur include: Nasal congestion and discharge may occur if the tumor spreads to the maxilla. The majority of cases appear sporadically in patients without a past history of cancer. Though the exact cause is unknown, researchers have speculated that diet, stress, environmental factors, and immunologic abnormalities play a part in causing certain types of cancer including Ameloblastic Carcinoma. Chemotherapy has not proven effective in treating Ameloblastic Carcinoma, leaving surgical removal of the tumor one of the only options. Though surgery may be effective, the tumor tends to reoccur years later, requiring the patient to follow a life-long schedule of examinations.
