Allied Healthcare is the UK’s largest domiciliary care business and a leading provider of outsourced healthcare services to the English primary care sector.  Allied Healthcare started in 1972, with a nursing home in Staffordshire. It now has 140 branches across the UK and Ireland.   Allied Healthcare was acquired by Saga group  in 2011.   In December 2015, Saga agreed to sell Allied Healthcare to Aurelius Group,  which describes themselves as  a pan-European asset manager with offices in Munich, London, Stockholm, and Madrid.  Nestor Primecare Services Ltd., registered in Stafford, is the legal entity behind the Allied Healthcare brand.  It also provides Out-of-hours services.  On 21 April 2018, Allied Healthcare announced it would seek a Company Voluntary Arrangement to protect itself from creditors due to a "highly challenging environment", through it would continue to operate without redundancies.  In October 2014 Allied Healthcare, then owned by Saga, was ordered to pay the legal costs of Elaine Fernandez, a nurse who was awarded more than £80,000 by an employment tribunal in 2013. It ruled she was unfairly dismissed and suffered detriment for making protected whistleblowing disclosures. The tribunal said the company had pursued a "defensive position" that was "unreasonably hostile".  She had raised concerns after Hywel Dda Health Board which commissioned the company to provide nursing care for a disabled patient decided to replace nurses with healthcare assistants.
