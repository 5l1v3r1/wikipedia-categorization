As a result, such a patient may receive something other than the normal <a href=\"/wiki/Standard_of_care#Medical_standard_of_care\" title=\"Standard of care\">standard of care</a>; the deviation may be in the direction of either greater or lesser safety and quality.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>VIP medicine may be initially reflected in expedited care in an emergency room or more immediate and direct access to specialists, bypassing <a href=\"/wiki/Primary_care\" title=\"Primary care\">primary care</a> providers.

A high rate of signing-out of the hospital <a href=\"/wiki/Against_medical_advice\" title=\"Against medical advice\">against medical advice</a> was a notable attendant problem.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Motivation\">Motivation</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=VIP_medicine&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Motivation\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Prominent or famous people who fall ill have obvious reasons for desiring instant and ample medical care. Additionally, they have a desire to avoid public scrutiny in matters of private medical care, as all patients do, and may demand special accommodations on this basis. They may want to avoid the prying eyes of journalists as well as those of the curious onlookers among the hospital staff who may not be directly involved in their care. Their desire for privacy is an understandable aspect of their need for extra security. Often the pressure on medical staff for special accommodations comes from a VIP's entourage rather than from the patient.\n</p><p>Medical personnel are also not immune to becoming fascinated by the presence of a celebrity or powerful figure. Physicians and hospitals may relish the extra revenue accruing from the treatment of VIP patients, sometimes in the form of lavish donations, and so may accommodate them accordingly. Some wealthy patients are not above gifting individual providers lavishly in hopes of easier accommodation of their needs, a situation that creates a conflict of interest when specific requests may be counter to a patient's welfare.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"VIP_wards\">VIP wards</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=VIP_medicine&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: VIP wards\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Often characterized by walnut-paneled rooms and high-thread-count bed sheets, VIP accommodations at large hospitals have traditionally inspired special, sometimes sarcastic, nicknames such as \"the Gold Coast\" and \"Millionaires' Row\".

Excessive drug prescriptions may be written and imaging studies ordered. Some health care programs for corporate executives, for example, involve periodic full-body <a href=\"/wiki/CT_scan\" title=\"CT scan\">CT scans</a> as screening tests as part of the \"chairman's physical\", a measure considered entirely unjustified as routine care. Over-medication may result. Imaging tests may actually increase the risk of cancer from radiation exposure and have never really been shown to improve anyone's health. And if there is an <a href=\"/wiki/Incidental_finding\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Incidental finding\">incidental finding</a>, as there often is, more tests might be ordered, which may lead to unnecessary biopsies.</li>\n<li>A VIP may insist on the senior-most specialist at an academic institution or teaching hospital\u2014the chair of the department of medicine, or of surgery, for instance. But the senior-most, or most eminent, caregiver is not necessarily the most skilled at performing a given procedure. Such an individual may be out of practice, or no longer up-to-date, and the \"no name\" subordinate may actually be much more skilled.</li>\n<li>In their haste to attend to a VIP without stint, star-struck administrators, doctors and nurses may, in their distraction and flustration, provide substandard care. (A case in point was when former President <a href=\"/wiki/Gerald_Ford\" title=\"Gerald Ford\">Gerald Ford</a> was discharged from the hospital with the diagnosis of an inner-ear infection when, in fact, he had suffered a stroke.<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>) Many VIP wings are physically removed some distance  from the rest of the hospital; in the case of a \"code\", such as a cardiac arrest in the VIP area, staff may be dangerously far away. Even proper routine staffing with the appropriate specialist nursing care (cardiac nurses, orthopedic nurses, etc.) may not get all the way out to an exceptional, isolated patient.</li>\n<li>VIPs also have particular issues with privacy because everyone is interested in their health and may compromise confidentiality when managing medical records and studies.</li>\n<li>Medical personnel may acquiesce to a VIP's unorthodox requests, even when doing so represents a breach of standards or is frankly dangerous to other patients. Although a Middle Eastern royal at Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital had a <a href=\"/wiki/Drug-resistance\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Drug-resistance\">drug-resistant infection</a>, nurses and physicians there in 2014 complied when he asked that they not wear protective gowns because he felt the gowns implied that he was \"dirty\", which he found offensive.<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> VIPs may be prescribed narcotics or other controlled substances when an ordinary patient would be denied them, or they may be over-medicated with larger amounts of such drugs than appropriate.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Solutions_to_related_problems\">Solutions to related problems</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=VIP_medicine&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Solutions to related problems\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Some medical institutions have drafted new policy directed at correcting some of the excesses of VIP medicine.

At the <a href=\"/wiki/Mayo_Clinic\" title=\"Mayo Clinic\">Mayo Clinic</a> in Minnesota, new policy states that personal gifts to staff in excess of $25 value cannot be accepted and must be forwarded to the development office.<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Notable_medical_VIP_suites.2C_wards.2C_and_floors\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Notable_medical_VIP_suites,_wards,_and_floors\">Notable medical VIP suites, wards, and floors</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=VIP_medicine&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Notable medical VIP suites, wards, and floors\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable plainlinks\">This list is <a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Lists#Incomplete_lists\" title=\"Wikipedia:WikiProject Lists\">incomplete</a>; you can help by <a class=\"external text\" href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=VIP_medicine&amp;action=edit\">expanding it</a>.</div>\n<ul><li>The Pavilion at <a href=\"/wiki/Brigham_and_Women%27s_Hospital\" title=\"Brigham and Women&#39;s Hospital\">Brigham and Women's Hospital</a>, Boston.</li>\n<li>The Phillips House at <a href=\"/wiki/Massachusetts_General_Hospital\" title=\"Massachusetts General Hospital\">Massachusetts General Hospital</a>, Boston.<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Notable_practitioners_of_VIP_medicine\">Notable practitioners of VIP medicine</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=VIP_medicine&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Notable practitioners of VIP medicine\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Max_Jacobson\" title=\"Max Jacobson\">Max Jacobson</a>, physician to 1950s and '60s celebrities; known as \"Dr Feelgood\"</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Theodor_Morell\" title=\"Theodor Morell\">Theodor Morell</a>, Adolf Hitler's personal physician</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Conrad_Murray\" title=\"Conrad Murray\">Conrad Murray</a>, Michael Jackson's personal physician</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/George_C._Nichopoulos\" title=\"George C.
