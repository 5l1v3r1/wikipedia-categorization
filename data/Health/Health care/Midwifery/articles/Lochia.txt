In the field of obstetrics, lochia is the vaginal discharge after giving birth (puerperium) containing blood, mucus, and uterine tissue.  Lochia discharge typically continues for 4 to 6 weeks after childbirth,  which is known as the postpartum period. It is sterile for the first 2  days, but not so by the third or fourth day, as the uterus begins to be colonized by vaginal commensals such as non-hemolytic streptococci and E. coli.  It progresses through three stages:  Note: Ambulant patients < 2 weeks, Moribund Patients > 2 weeks, Preterm Delivery < 2 weeks, Twin Delivery > 2 weeks. In general, lochia has an odor similar to that of normal menstrual fluid. Any offensive odor or change to a greenish color indicates contamination by organisms such as chlamydia or saprophytic. Lochia that is retained within the uterus is known as lochiostasis  or lochioschesis, and can result in lochiometra  (distention of the uterus - pushing it out of shape). Lochiorrhea describes an excessive flow of lochia and can indicate infection.
