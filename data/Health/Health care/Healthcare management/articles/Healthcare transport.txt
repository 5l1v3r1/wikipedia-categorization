Healthcare Transport is the systematic process by which patient- and business-critical materials, such as patient specimens, pharmaceuticals, supplies and medical records are transported to and from multiple touch points within healthcare organizations.  Each year, 83% of adults and 90% of children in the United States have contact with a health care professional. In total, these events add to greater than 1.1 billion ambulatory care visits to physician offices, hospital outpatient departments and emergency rooms. According to a recent article  by Dr. Robert Handfield,  a true healthcare transport partner supports healthcare organizational business objectives beyond transactional pickups and deliveries to address cost efficiencies, centralization, standardization, error reduction, technology maximization, management reporting for strategic decision-making, system connectivity and analytics for a platform for growth. The daily movement of these critical materials directly impacts an organizationâ€™s ability to deliver optimal care.
