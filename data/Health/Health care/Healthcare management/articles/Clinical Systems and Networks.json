The technological demands place limits on the type of work organization possible, but a work organization has social and psychological properties of its own that are independent of <a href=\"/wiki/Technology\" title=\"Technology\">technology</a>\u2026.. A socio-technical system must also satisfy the financial conditions of the industry of which it is a part. It must have economic validity. It has in fact social, technological and economic dimensions, all of which are interdependent but all of which have independent values of their own.\u2019 \u201d   (Rice:  Productivity and Social Organization.)\nSource:  Trist, E.L., Higgin, G.W., Murray, H., Pollock, A.B.

Traditional approaches have sought to manage health problems by tighter control of organisations which cover a wide range of health problems, hospitals and <a href=\"/wiki/Care_in_the_Community\" title=\"Care in the Community\">community care</a> for example with patients being referred to the former and discharged to the latter. This two-box approach has many weaknesses, implying, for example, that a hospital is not a community service. Another approach is to present different levels of care in the form of a <a href=\"/wiki/Venn_diagram\" title=\"Venn diagram\">Venn diagram</a>.\n</p><p>For serious, acute problems, a fractured <a href=\"/wiki/Femur\" title=\"Femur\">femur</a> for example the spectrum of the relative contributions of the different sectors of care, are consistent from between countries and within a country. <a href=\"/wiki/Self_care\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Self care\">Self care</a> is minimal, primary care by an <a href=\"/wiki/Ambulance\" title=\"Ambulance\">ambulance</a> service brief, and most care is provided in <a href=\"/wiki/Secondary_care\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Secondary care\">secondary care</a>, with <a href=\"/wiki/Tertiary_care\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Tertiary care\">tertiary care</a> being needed for the person who has multiple injuries in addition to the fractured femur and needs the services of a <a href=\"/wiki/Trauma_center\" title=\"Trauma center\">trauma center</a>. For chronic conditions, however the distribution of care is often sub optimal because the indications for moving from one level of care to another are often unclear and may be influenced by emotional and, apparently, irrational factors. \nEven if the number of patients in each part of the spectrum is correct there will be some\n</p><p>\u2022\tReceiving care that is more intensive than they need\n\u2022\tReceiving care that is less intensive that they need\n</p><p>Both groups reduce the value derived from the resources invested\n</p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw2189\nCached time: 20180921212942\nCache expiry: 86400\nDynamic content: true\nCPU time usage: 0.040 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.062 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 93/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 4340/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 16/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 9/40\nExpensive parser function count: 1/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\nLua time usage: 0.016/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 820 KB/50 MB\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   47.130      1 Template:Orphan\n100.00%   47.130      1 -total\n 68.51%   32.291      1 Template:Ambox\n  4.01%    1.890      1 Template:Monthyear-1\n  3.69%    1.741      1 Template:Monthyear\n  2.98%    1.406      2 Template:PAGENAMEU\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:25168936-0!canonical and timestamp 20180921212942 and revision id 807944107\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","hidden":"","*":"Orphaned_articles_from_May_2016"},{"sortkey":"","hidden":"","*":"All_orphaned_articles"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Healthcare_management"}],"links":[{"ns":14,"exists":"","*":"Category:Orphaned articles from May 2016"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Ambulance"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Care in the Community"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Closed system"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Dataset"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Feedback loop"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Femur"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Field of study"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Goal"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Healthcare"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Healthcare system"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Hospital"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Operations management"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Parkinson's disease"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Primary care"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Renal failure"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Secondary care"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Self care"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Socio-technical systems"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Technology"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Tertiary care"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Trauma center"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Venn diagram"},{"ns":0,"*":"Probity"},{"ns":4,"exists":"","*":"Wikipedia:Orphan"},{"ns":12,"exists":"","*":"Help:Link"}],"templates":[{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Orphan"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Ambox"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Monthyear"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Monthyear-1"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:PAGENAMEU"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Unsubst"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Message box"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:No globals"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Yesno"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Arguments"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Message box/configuration"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/data"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/config"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/shared"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/blacklist"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Namespace detect/data"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Namespace detect/config"}],"images":["Wiki_letter_w.svg"],"externallinks":["//edwardbetts.com/find_link?q=Clinical_Systems_and_Networks"],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Examples of the uses of the term system relevant to healthcare","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Clinical_Systems_and_Networks","byteoffset":348,"anchor":"Examples_of_the_uses_of_the_term_system_relevant_to_healthcare"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Setting of Objectives","number":"2","index":"2","fromtitle":"Clinical_Systems_and_Networks","byteoffset":3879,"anchor":"Setting_of_Objectives"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Clinical Systems and Networks","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q5133800"}]}}
