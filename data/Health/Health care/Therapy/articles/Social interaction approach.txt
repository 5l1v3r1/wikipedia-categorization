The Social interaction approach (SIA) is a type of brief therapy.  It is characterised by the client being in charge of the therapy session as the counselor acts as a mediator.  It is based on socio-communicative functions.  It is useful in language advancement, where children cue their parents to supply appropriate language experiences.  SIA provides efficient social communication at any point in child development.
