Maintenance therapy is a medical therapy that is designed to help a primary treatment succeed.   For example, maintenance chemotherapy may be given to people who have a cancer in remission in an attempt to prevent a relapse.  This form of treatment is also a common approach for the management of many incurable, chronic diseases such as periodontal disease, Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.
