Abbott Informatics is a subsidiary of Abbott Laboratories that develops and sells web-based laboratory information management systems (LIMS) - software used to manage the collection, processing, storage, retrieval and analysis of information generated in laboratories. The company was founded by Itschak Friedman and Dinu Toiba in Israel in 1986, was originally named Laboratory Information Management Systems, and developed and sold LIMS software called "Starlims"; the company itself eventually was renamed to Starlims.   By 2005, the company's software was installed at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and in systems of state health authorities in 12 US states.  The company held its IPO in the US in 2007.   Friedman served as CEO until the company was acquired by Abbott Laboratories in 2009 for $123 million; at that time the company had 160 employees and most of its operations and sales were in the US, the UK, and Hong Kong.   By the time of the sale, Starlims was offered as a web application.  Abbott intended to fold Starlims' products offerings into its other health information technology businesses to strengthen its clinical diagnostics business.  In 2014, Abbott changed the subsidiary's name from Starlims to Abbott Informatics.
