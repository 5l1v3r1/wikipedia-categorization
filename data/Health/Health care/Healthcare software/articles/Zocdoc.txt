Zocdoc is an online medical care appointment booking service, providing free of charge medical care search facility for end users by integrating information about medical practices and doctors' individual schedules in a central location. The company is based in New York City, with offices in Scottsdale, Arizona and Pune, India. Zocdoc provides a scheduling system on paid subscription basis for medical personnel. The scheduling system can be accessed by subscribers both as an online service and via the deployed office calendar software, or integrated with their websites.  The subscriber's schedules are available to the  patients. The end user-searchable database includes specialties, range of services, office locations, photographs, personnel educational background and user-submitted reviews.   For each doctor the users are able to review the free slots in the schedule and make appointments for specific time slots.  The service was launched during the TechCrunch40 conference in 2007.  Initially limited to Manhattan,  it has since expanded to cover 40% of the U.S. population across 2000+ cities, and is  used by more than 5,000,000 people per month.       The service may be used as Android,  iOS, or web application,  as well as Spanish-language version with the launch of Zocdoc en Espa√±ol.  In October 2012, the company launched its first new product since inception: Zocdoc Check-in, which  allows patients to fill out their paperwork online in advance of their visit.  As of June 2013, the company had raised over $95 million in venture capital from investors.
