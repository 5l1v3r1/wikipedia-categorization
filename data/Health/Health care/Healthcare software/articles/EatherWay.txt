EatherWay is an appointment scheduling software developed by AlignMinds Technologies to help people to schedule their medical appointments.  The system offers three channels for its users to book doctor appointments - normal telephony, internet or sms. It acts as a website, a platform to receive and send text messages and an automated system to receive and respond to voice calls.   For doctors, EatherWay can act as a customisable patient flow management system.  The system is intended to avoid the long queues in hospitals and clinics and to reduce the waiting times of patients.
