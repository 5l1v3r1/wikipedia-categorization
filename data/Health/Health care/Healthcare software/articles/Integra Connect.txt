Integra Connect is a healthcare technology company focused on oncology and urology practices, as well as emergency medicine companies and the broader life sciences industry.  Integra Connect was founded in 2015 by Raj Mantena and a team of healthcare executives following the passage of the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015.  Integra Connect announced itself more publicly at the HIMSS 2017 conference in February of 2017 and has 1,400 employees in 10 offices worldwide.  In 2017, it was announced that Innovative Oncology Business Solutions' Community Oncology Medical Home program triage pathways would be integrated into Integra Connect's Oncology Care Model  and population health technologies.  Triage activities enabled through Integra Connect’s solutions will focus on first responders (phone operators) and nurses, who will be guided through step-by-step clinical decision making as they discuss and assess a wide variety of patient issues such as pain, nausea, and vomiting.   In 2016, the Large Urology Group Practice Association partnered Integra Connect to develop advanced alternative payment models specific to urology, with an initial focus of value-based prostate cancer care.  Integra Connect conducted a survey of about 800 physicians in 2017   with 100 percent of survey respondents admitting they have not yet fully grasped MACRA's impact on their practices, 51 percent of respondents said they don’t believe their EHR can handle value-based care, and 62 percent of respondents either don't know how, or have no plans, to fund these investments. Integra Connect recently announced EHR partnerships with three leading community oncology practices:  Augusta Oncology, Utah Cancer Specialists and Hudson Valley Cancer Center   .  These practices will use Integra Connect's oncology EHR to improve patient care and experience, replacing legacy EHRs which were not designed with value-based care in mind.
