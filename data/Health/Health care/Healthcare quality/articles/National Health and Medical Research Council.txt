  The National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) is Australia's peak funding body for medical research, with a budget of roughly $900Â million a year.   The Council was established to develop and maintain health standards and is responsible for implementing the National Health and Medical Research Council Act 1992.   NHMRC is a material agency and is incorporated under the federal Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997. It was a part of the Department of Health and Ageing portfolio until mid-2007 when it became a self-governing statutory authority. Along with the Australian Research Council (ARC), NHMRC is one of the Australian government's two main agencies for allocating competitively research funding to academics and researchers at Australian universities. NHMRC research grading is commonly used to assess medical publications. These include, from the most reliable to least: systematic review, randomized control trial, cohort study, case control, case series.  In 2010 the NHMRC's new online system for grant applications was the subject of criticism after a series of technical problems.  The community organisation Organisation Intersex International Australia criticised the NHMRC for funding research programs that pathologise intersex variations as disorders.
