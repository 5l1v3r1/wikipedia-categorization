In 1973, Congress passed the <a href=\"/wiki/Health_Maintenance_Organization_Act_of_1973\" title=\"Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973\">Health Maintenance Organization Act</a>, which encouraged rapid growth of Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs), the first form of managed care.\n</p><p>Managed care plans are widely credited with subduing medical cost inflation in the late 1980s by reducing unnecessary hospitalizations, forcing providers to discount their rates, and causing the health care industry to become more efficient and competitive. Managed care plans and strategies proliferated and quickly became nearly ubiquitous in the U.S. However, this rapid growth led to a consumer backlash. Because many managed care health plans are provided by for-profit companies, their cost-control efforts created widespread perception that they were more interested in saving money than providing health care.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Nation&#39;s_Business_4-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Nation&#39;s_Business-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> In a 2004 poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a majority of those polled said they believed that managed care decreased the time doctors spend with patients, made it harder for people who are sick to see specialists, and had failed to produce significant health care savings. These public perceptions have been fairly consistent in polling since 1997.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The backlash included vocal critics, including disgruntled patients and consumer-advocacy groups, who argued that managed care plans were controlling costs by denying medically necessary services to patients, even in life-threatening situations, or by providing low-quality care.

As defined in the act, a federally-qualified HMO would, in exchange for a subscriber fee (premium), allow members access to a panel of employed <a href=\"/wiki/Medical_doctor\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Medical doctor\">physicians</a> or a network of doctors and facilities including <a href=\"/wiki/Hospital\" title=\"Hospital\">hospitals</a>.

In practice, an HMO is a coordinated delivery system that combines both the financing and the delivery of health care for enrollees. In the design of the plan, each member is assigned a \"gatekeeper\", a <a href=\"/wiki/Primary_care_physician\" title=\"Primary care physician\">primary care physician</a> (PCP) responsible for the overall care of members assigned. Specialty services require a specific referral from the PCP to the specialist. Non-emergency hospital admissions also require specific pre-authorization by the PCP. Typically, services are not covered if performed by a provider not an employee of or specifically approved by the HMO unless it defines the situation to be an emergency.\n</p><p>Financial sanctions for use of emergency facilities in non-emergency situations were once an issue, but prudent layperson language now applies to all emergency-service utilization, and penalties are rare.\n</p><p>Since the 1980s, under the <a href=\"/wiki/ERISA\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"ERISA\">ERISA</a> Act passed in Congress in 1974 and its <a href=\"/wiki/Federal_preemption\" title=\"Federal preemption\">preemptive</a> effect on state common law tort lawsuits that \"relate to\" Employee Benefit Plans, HMOs administering benefits through private employer health plans have been protected by federal law from <a href=\"/wiki/Medical_malpractice\" title=\"Medical malpractice\">malpractice litigation</a>, on the grounds that the decisions regarding patient care are administrative rather than medical in nature.

The deductible must be paid in full before any benefits are provided. After the deductible is met, the coinsurance benefits apply. If the PPO plan is an 80% coinsurance plan with a $1,000 deductible, the patient pays 100% of the allowed provider fee up to $1,000. The insurer will pay 80% of the other fees, and the patient will pay the remaining 20%.  Charges above the allowed amount are not payable by the patient or insurer but written off as a discount by the physician.\n</p><p>Because the patient is picking up a substantial portion of the \"first dollars\" of coverage, PPO are the least expensive types of coverage.<sup id=\"cite_ref-17\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-17\">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Point_of_service_.28POS.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Point_of_service_(POS)\">Point of service (POS)</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Managed_care&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Point of service (POS)\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Point_of_service_plan\" title=\"Point of service plan\">Point of service plan</a></div>\n<p>A POS plan uses some of the features of each of the above plans.

For example, if patients stay in a network of providers and seeks a referral to use a specialist, they may have a copayment only. However, if they use an out of network provider but do not seek a referral, they will pay more.\n</p><p>POS plans are becoming more popular because they offer more flexibility and freedom of choice than standard HMOs.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Private_fee-for-service_.28PFFS.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Private_fee-for-service_(PFFS)\">Private fee-for-service (PFFS)</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Managed_care&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: Private fee-for-service (PFFS)\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>There are basically two types of health insurance: fee-for-service (indemnity) and managed care. Policies may vary from low cost to all-inclusive to meet different demands of customers, depending on needs, preferences and budget. Fee-for-service is a traditional kind of health care policy: insurance companies pay medical staff fees for each service provided to an insured patient. Such plans offer a wide choice of doctors and hospitals.\n</p><p>Fee-for-service coverage falls into Basic and Major Medical Protection categories. Basic protection deals with costs of a hospital room, hospital services, care and supplies, cost of surgery in or out of hospital, and doctor visits. Major Medical Protection covers costs of serious illnesses and injuries, which usually require long-term treatment and rehabilitation period. Basic and Major Medical Insurance coverage combined are called a Comprehensive Health Care Plan. Policies do not cover some services.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Managed_care_in_indemnity_insurance_plans\">Managed care in indemnity insurance plans</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Managed_care&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10\" title=\"Edit section: Managed care in indemnity insurance plans\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Many \"traditional\" or \"<a href=\"/wiki/Insurance#Indemnification\" title=\"Insurance\">indemnity</a>\" health insurance plans now incorporate some managed care features, such as precertification for non-emergency hospital admissions and utilization reviews. They are sometimes described as \"managed indemnity\" plans.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Impacts\">Impacts</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Managed_care&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11\" title=\"Edit section: Impacts\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The overall impact of managed care remains widely debated. Proponents argue that it has increased efficiency, improved overall standards, and led to a better understanding of the relationship and quality. They argue that there is no consistent, direct correlation between the cost of care and its quality, pointing to a 2002 Juran Institute study which estimated that the \"cost of poor quality\" caused by overuse, misuse, and waste amounts to 30 percent of all direct healthcare spending.<sup id=\"cite_ref-PWC_7-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-PWC-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> The emerging practice of <a href=\"/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine\" title=\"Evidence-based medicine\">evidence-based medicine</a> is being used to determine when lower-cost medicine may in fact be more effective.\n</p><p>Critics of managed care argue that \"for-profit\" managed care has been an unsuccessful health policy, as it has contributed to higher health care costs (25\u201333% higher overhead at some of the largest HMOs), increased the number of uninsured citizens, driven away health care providers, and applied downward pressure on quality (worse scores on 14 of 14 quality indicators reported to the National Committee for Quality Assurance).<sup id=\"cite_ref-18\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-18\">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup> Others argue that managed care puts the emphasis on financial implications instead of healthcare. In hospital meetings, it has been reported that senior staff feel \"the only people with real decisions to make are the insurers\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-19\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-19\">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The most common managed care financial arrangement, <a href=\"/wiki/Capitation_(healthcare)\" title=\"Capitation (healthcare)\">capitation</a>, places healthcare providers in the role of micro-health insurers, assuming the responsibility for managing the unknown future health care costs of their patients. Small insurers, like individual consumers, tend to have annual costs that fluctuate far more than larger insurers. The term \"Professional Caregiver Insurance Risk\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-20\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-20\">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-21\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-21\">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup> explains the inefficiencies in health care finance that result when insurance risks are inefficiently transferred to health care providers who are expected to <a href=\"/wiki/Capitated_reimbursement\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Capitated reimbursement\">cover such costs</a> in return for their capitation payments. As Cox (2006) demonstrates, providers cannot be adequately compensated for their insurance risks without forcing managed care organizations to become price uncompetitive vis-a-vis risk retaining insurers. Cox (2010) <sup id=\"cite_ref-22\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-22\">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup> shows that smaller insurers have lower probabilities of modest profits than large insurers, higher probabilities of high losses than large insurers, provide lower benefits to policyholders, and have far higher surplus requirements. All these effects work against the viability of healthcare provider insurance risk assumption.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Managed_care&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Healthcare_in_the_United_States\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Healthcare in the United States\">Healthcare in the United States</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Health_insurance_in_the_United_States\" title=\"Health insurance in the United States\">Health insurance in the United States</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Independent_medical_review\" title=\"Independent medical review\">Independent medical review</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Medical_care_ratio\" title=\"Medical care ratio\">Medical care ratio</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/URAC\" title=\"URAC\">URAC</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Managed_care&amp;action=edit&amp;section=13\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap mw-references-columns\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh?term=managed%20care\">Managed Care Programs</a>.
