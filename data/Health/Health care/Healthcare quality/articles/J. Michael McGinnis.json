He attended public schools for K-12 in San Mateo, but from ages 9 to 17, his summers were spent back in Missouri, working on his maternal grandfather\u2019s corn, wheat and soy bean farm in central Missouri.  Active in student government from an early age, he continued those interests as a pre-med undergraduate at the <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley\" title=\"University of California, Berkeley\">University of California at Berkeley</a>, serving as the president of his graduating class.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Education_and_professional_training\">Education and professional training</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=J._Michael_McGinnis&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Education and professional training\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>During his undergraduate years at <a href=\"/wiki/U.C._Berkeley\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"U.C.

This competitive program still thrives 50 years later, sending over 75 students to DC every summer. McGinnis graduated from Berkeley in 1966 with a BA in political science (political theory), and then attended <a href=\"/wiki/UCLA\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"UCLA\">UCLA</a>, receiving both an MA in political science (international relations) and an MD in 1971.

He was class commencement speaker for all three of his university graduating classes: Berkeley, <a href=\"/wiki/UCLA_Medical_School\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"UCLA Medical School\">UCLA Medical</a>, and the Kennedy School at Harvard. After an internship in internal medicine at the <a href=\"/wiki/Boston_City_Hospital\" title=\"Boston City Hospital\">Boston City Hospital</a>, McGinnis completed a residency in preventive medicine while serving in the <a href=\"/wiki/U.S._Public_Health_Service\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"U.S. Public Health Service\">U.S. Public Health Service</a> in 1972 as an international medical officer.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"International_contributions\">International contributions</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=J._Michael_McGinnis&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: International contributions\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>As part of his graduate studies in international relations, McGinnis spent time in residency at the <a href=\"/wiki/World_Health_Organization\" title=\"World Health Organization\">World Health Organization</a> offices in <a href=\"/wiki/Lausanne\" title=\"Lausanne\">Lausanne</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Geneva\" title=\"Geneva\">Geneva</a>, exploring the diplomatic dynamics at the formation of the organization and the role it played in using its practical humanitarian mission to forge collaborative activities among often competing nations.

In 1974, he was recruited by <a href=\"/wiki/DA_Henderson\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"DA Henderson\">DA Henderson</a> to join the World Health Organization's smallpox eradication program in India. Working initially as a field epidemiologist tracking and containing reported cases, McGinnis assumed responsibility as WHO's State Coordinator for the eradication program in <a href=\"/wiki/Uttar_Pradesh\" title=\"Uttar Pradesh\">Uttar Pradesh</a>, India's largest state, and oversaw the completion of the eradication effort and the implementation of the surveillance system for the maintenance phase of the program.\n</p><p>Returning to the United States after the end of smallpox, McGinnis shifted his focus for the next two decades to domestic health policy (see below), but from 1995 to 1996, again at the request of the World Health Organization, he became chair of the <a href=\"/wiki/World_Bank\" title=\"World Bank\">World Bank</a>/<a href=\"/wiki/European_Commission\" title=\"European Commission\">European Commission</a> Sectoral Task Force on Health and Human Services in Bosnia.  This was one of several task forces established to manage support for postwar reconstruction of the basic infrastructure, economic, and human service capabilities in the war-torn region.

His 1993 paper in the <a href=\"/wiki/Journal_of_the_American_Medical_Association\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Journal of the American Medical Association\">Journal of the American Medical Association</a>, <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8411605\">\u201cActual Causes of Death\u201d</a> co-authored with <a href=\"/wiki/William_Foege\" title=\"William Foege\">William Foege</a>, focused attention on the root causes of the nation\u2019s leading killers and underscored the preventability of many of the nation\u2019s leading health threats. Building on a growing evidence base linking lifestyle, environment, and behavior to health, the McGinnis and Foege article pointed out that the conditions holding leading positions on mortality tables\u2014e.g. heart disease, cancer, stroke, injury, diabetes\u2014were in fact caused substantially by factors such as tobacco, diet and activity patterns, alcohol, toxic agents, and other potentially controllable sources. They identified nine leading preventable root causes of death, and calculated that the behavior-related factors on the list alone accounted for about 40% of deaths in the United States.\n</p><p>McGinnis extended his work to reframe the notion of health, from a view that is disease-centric to one that captures more broadly the full range of factors that lead to disease and early death\u2014or to good health. Drawing from the work on actual causes, as well as a developing evidence base on the influence of stress, class distinctions, socio-economic status, and genetics, he organized his assessment around the perspective that health is fundamentally shaped by determinants that fall within five domains: genetic predispositions, social circumstances, physical environments, behavioral choices, and medical care. Underscoring that the most important dynamics occur at the intersections of the determinant domains, his 2002 paper in <a href=\"/wiki/Health_Affairs\" title=\"Health Affairs\">Health Affairs</a>, <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11900188\">\u201cThe Case for More Active Policy Attention to Health Promotion\u201d</a>, co-authored with Pamela Russo and James Knickman, summarized quantitative assessments of the relative contributions of each of these five domains to the overall burden of early death in the population. As noted in the paper\u2019s title, the most notable policy asynchrony they pointed out was that, while only 10 to 15% of premature deaths could be avoided through improvements in health care, 95% of aggregate national spending on health goes to medical care services.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Healthy_People_program\">The Healthy People program</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=J._Michael_McGinnis&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: The Healthy People program\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In 1977, McGinnis was a Fellow at <a href=\"/wiki/Harvard_Medical_School\" title=\"Harvard Medical School\">Harvard Medical School\u2019s</a> Center for Community Health and Medical Care when he accepted an offer from the newly appointed Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare <a href=\"/wiki/Joseph_Califano\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Joseph Califano\">Joseph Califano</a> to return to Washington to work in the <a href=\"/wiki/Carter_Administration\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Carter Administration\">Carter Administration</a>.

Begun when he was serving as Chair of the Secretary\u2019s Task Force on Disease Prevention and Health Promotion for HEW Secretary Joseph Califano and Surgeon General <a href=\"/wiki/Julius_Richmond\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Julius Richmond\">Julius Richmond</a> in 1978, it started as an effort to develop a Surgeon General\u2019s report to serve as a U.S. answer to <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/ph-sp/pube-pubf/perintrod-eng.php\">A New Perspective on the Health of Canadians</a>, a groundbreaking report released in 1974 by Canadian Minister of Health <a href=\"/wiki/Marc_Lalonde\" title=\"Marc Lalonde\">Marc Lalonde</a>.\n</p><p>McGinnis felt the U.S. report could go beyond simply marshaling the scientific evidence underpinning the power of prevention, to establish quantifiable, evidence-based goals for improving the health of Americans through preventive interventions. This strategy reflected McGinnis' experience in India with the successful eradication of <a href=\"/wiki/Smallpox\" title=\"Smallpox\">smallpox</a>, which used quantified targets to drive focus and the deployment of resources. Published in 1979, <i><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/retrieve/ResourceMetadata/NNBBGK/p-segmented/true\">Healthy People: The Surgeon General's Report on Health Promotion and Disease Prevention</a></i> included the first-ever measurable, decade-long goals for reducing death rates for Americans by 1990 at each of the major life stages: reducing infant mortality by 35%, childhood mortality by 20%, adolescent and young adult mortality by 20%, and adult mortality by 25%. For older adults, the goal was to reduce the average number of sick days by 20% over the decade.\n</p><p>McGinnis also launched a parallel effort involving each of the agencies of the <a href=\"/wiki/U.S._Public_Health_Service\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"U.S. Public Health Service\">U.S. Public Health Service</a> (<a href=\"/wiki/National_Institutes_of_Health\" title=\"National Institutes of Health\">National Institutes of Health</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Centers for Disease Control\">Centers for Disease Control</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration\" title=\"Food and Drug Administration\">Food and Drug Administration</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Indian_Health_Service\" title=\"Indian Health Service\">Indian Health Service</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Health_Resources_and_Services_Administration\" title=\"Health Resources and Services Administration\">Health Resources and Services Administration</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Substance_Abuse_and_Mental_Health_Services_Administration\" title=\"Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration\">Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration</a>), in cooperative work with non-governmental experts from around the country to develop measurable 1990 objectives in 15 priority areas within the three prevention domains: health promotion, health protection, and clinical preventive services. These objectives targeted improvements on issues such as tobacco use, environmental quality, and high blood pressure control, child passenger restraints, occupational health, and environmental quality deemed necessary to achieve the national goals. The objectives were released in 1980 in <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.eric.ed.gov/PDFS/ED209206.pdf\">Promoting Health/Preventing Disease: Objectives for the Nation</a>.\n</p><p>A broad range of stakeholders rallied around the newly minted national prevention agenda, including through the Healthy People Consortium, which brought states, major cities, and voluntary national organizations together to adopt and tailor these national objectives to their particular needs and priorities.  When the 1990 results came in, progress toward better health was on or close to the stated goals in each case: a 35% reduction in infant mortality, a 25% reduction in child deaths, a 12% reduction for adolescent and young adult deaths, a 25% lower adult death rate, and 17% fewer days of disability for older adults.
