The Compliance Team Inc., is a US for-profit organization which runs the "Exemplary Provider" accreditation programs, a US-based alternative to the Joint Commission.  It was set up in 1994 and is based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In 2006, The Compliance Team was formally granted national deeming authority by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services as an accrediting body for all type of durable medical equipment (DME) including respiratory, mobility, woundcare, orthopedic, prosthetics, orthotics, diabetic, ostomy, and incontinence supplies. DME point of service providers include pharmacy, home care, podiatrists and orthopedic surgeons.  The Compliance Team has accredited approximately 5,000 DMEPOS providers in the USA and Puerto Rico. It has been reported that demand for participation in their Exemplary Provider Program has significantly increased since being awarded Medicare deeming status.
