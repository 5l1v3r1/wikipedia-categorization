The purpose of the Flight Test Safety Committee (FTSC) is to initiate and sustain a flight test related safety organization intended to promote flight safety, reduce the risk of mishap, promote risk reduction management and continually improve the flight test profession's communication and coordination. The Flight Test Safety Committee (FTSC) was formed in November 1994 by members of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots (SETP), the Society of Flight Test Engineers (SFTE) and the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA). Several other additional organizations presently comprise the FTSC.
