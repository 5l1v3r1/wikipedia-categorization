The Canadian Society of Safety Engineering (CSSE) is a Canadian association which promotes accident prevention. It was founded in 1949 by a small group of individuals drawn together in the common cause of accident prevention.  It grew from a provincially based organization to become a large professional organization for health and safety practitioners. Today, the CSSE has over 5,000 members across Canada, the United States, and around the world. The CSSE supports the operation of 35 local chapters, which provide a local forum for information exchange and networking among professionals. Through chapter meetings and activities, members promote and enhance the profile of the profession in communities throughout Canada. The mission of the CSSE is to be the resource for professional development, knowledge and information exchange to its members, its profession and the Canadian public. Certified Health and Safety Consultant (CHSC) The CHSC designation is awarded by the CSSE to health and safety professionals who have met certain academic and experience requirements and passed a series of examinations designed to test knowledge of occupational health and safety.
