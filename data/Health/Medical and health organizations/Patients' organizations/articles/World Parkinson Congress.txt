The World Parkinson Congress, often referred to as the WPC, is a non-religious, non-political, and non-profit making organization concerned with the health and welfare of people living with Parkinson's disease (PD) and their families and caregivers.  Founded in 2004, the WPC aims to bring the Parkinson's community together, under one roof, to allow for cross-pollination of community leaders to create opportunities to generate more robust ideas around the science and care of Parkinson's. The WPC Inc. has nearly 170 Organizational Partners      from around the world     There is no other International meeting focussed just on Parkinson's disease, nor is there an international format that looks at Parkinson's science and care that also invites people with Parkinson's to have a seat at the table.  Each World Parkinson Congress provides a unique forum for partnership between international patient and neurological organizations, the pharmaceutical industry. The  1st World Parkinson Congress - WPC 2006,   attracted more than 3,150 delegates from nearly 60 countries; the WPC 2010 had more than 3,000; WPC 2013 had more than 3,300 delegates.  Those delegates included a unique mix ofÂ : health professionals and researchers;  1100   people with Parkinson's, care partners and guests;  and members of press.
