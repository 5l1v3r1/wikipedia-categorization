The National Council on Problem Gambling was founded in 1972 by Msgr. Joseph A. Dunne and Dr. Robert Custer, among others. From the outset the Council established two principles that it continues to espouse today: that the organization would be the advocate for problem gamblers and their families, and that it would maintain a neutral stance regarding the activity of gambling. Its mission is to lead state and national stakeholders in the development of comprehensive policy and programs for all those affected by problem gambling with the purpose of serving as the national advocate for programs and services to assist problem gamblers and their families. The National Council is neither for nor against legalized gambling. The NCPG concentrates efforts on the national level, while the state affiliates work at the state and local level.  NCPG's network of state affiliate, individual and corporate members includes leaders in prevention, education, treatment, enforcement, research, responsible gaming and recovery communities. A large portion of the NCPG funding comes from its membership program. NCPG membership is organized with 3 classes of members: state affiliate, corporate and individual. The NCPG's major programs include the following: The Executive Director of the NCPG, Keith Whyte, has worked for The American Gaming Association.
