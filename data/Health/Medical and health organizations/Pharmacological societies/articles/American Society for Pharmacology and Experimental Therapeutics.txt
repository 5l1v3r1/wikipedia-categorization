The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics (ASPET) is an international scientific society founded in late 1908 by John Jacob Abel of Johns Hopkins University (also the founder of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology), with the aim of promoting the growth of pharmacological research.   Many society members are researchers in basic and clinical pharmacology who help develop disease-fighting medications and therapeutics.  ASPET is one of the constituent societies of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB).  The society's headquarters are in Bethesda, Maryland on the FASEB campus. The current president is Ken E. Thummel.  The society publishes three research journals and a review journal: Starting in 2012 these subscriptions are only offered online only. ASPET also publishes a quarterly newsletter, The Pharmacologist and Molecular Interventions magazine from 2001-2011. The society gives out several awards:  Travel awards are also given to students and postdocs.
