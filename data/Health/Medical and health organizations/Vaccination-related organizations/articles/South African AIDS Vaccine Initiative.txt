The South African AIDS Vaccine Initiative or SAAVI is a South African organisation with the mission of coordinating the research and development of HIV vaccines in and for South Africa. SAAVI was established in 1999 by the South African government as a project of the South African Medical Research Council. SAAVI frequently partners with the HIV Vaccine Trials Network.  In June 2009, SAAVI announced that it was testing a new HIV vaccine candidate but suspended all further vaccine development indefinitely due to lack of funds.  Official website
