Global Vaccines, Inc is a non-profit company set up to design and develop affordable vaccines for people in poor countries. In 2006, Robert E. Johnston, Ph.D. and Clayton W. Beard, Ph.D., opened the doors of Global Vaccines, Inc (GVI), a not-for-profit company, spinning out from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, in order to develop new vaccines free from the limitations of high profit-margin requirements. The company develops platform vaccine technologies that can be applied to a broad spectrum of disease targets selected on the basis of global public health needs rather than market potential. It is located in the Research Triangle Park in North Carolina. In several preclinical trials, Global Vaccines' novel technologies have already shown remarkable promise across a range of disease targets.    Primary technology publications from GVI
