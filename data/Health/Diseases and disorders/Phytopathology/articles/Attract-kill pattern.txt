An attract-kill pattern is an interaction between plant roots and pathogen, which plays an important role in suppression of Phytophthora disease in intercropping systems. The recent research from Key Laboratory of Agro-Biodiversity and Pest Management of Education Ministry of China indicated that maize roots attracted the zoospores of Phytophthora capsici and inhibited their motility. Then a large amount of cystospores closed to maize roots were lysed. The phenomenon has been widely found in various interactions between roots of non-host plant and Phytophthora.
