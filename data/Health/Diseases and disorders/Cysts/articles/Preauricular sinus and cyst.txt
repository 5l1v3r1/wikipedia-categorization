A preauricular sinus (also known as a congenital auricular fistula, a congenital preauricular fistula, a Geswein hole,  an ear pit, :782 or a preauricular cyst ) is a common congenital malformation characterized by a nodule, dent or dimple located anywhere adjacent to the external ear.  Frequency of preauricular sinus differs depending the population: 0.1–0.9% in the US, 0.9% in the UK, and 4–10% in Asia and parts of Africa.  Preauricular sinuses are inherited features, and most often appear unilaterally. They are present bilaterally in 25–50% of cases.  Preauricular sinuses and cysts result from developmental defects of the first and second pharyngeal arches.  This and other congenital ear malformations are sometimes associated with renal anomalies.   In rare circumstances these pits may be seen in genetic conditions such as branchio-oto-renal syndrome; however these conditions are always concurrent with other health concerns.  Occasionally a preauricular sinus or cyst can become infected.  Most preauricular sinuses are asymptomatic, and remain untreated unless they become infected too often.  Preauricular sinuses can be excised surgically, but often present a high risk of recurrence.  Courses of treatment typically include the following:
