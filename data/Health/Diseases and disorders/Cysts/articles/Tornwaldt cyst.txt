A Tornwaldt cyst is a benign cyst located in the upper posterior nasopharynx. It can be seen on computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head as a well-circumscribed round mass lying in the midline. In most cases, treatment is not necessary. It was first described by Gustav Ludwig Tornwaldt.
