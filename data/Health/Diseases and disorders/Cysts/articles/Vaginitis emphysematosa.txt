Vaginitis emphysematosa is a rare, benign vaginal cyst known from 173 cases.     Those women affected were 42 to 65 years.  The cysts appear grouped but defined from one another, smooth, and can be as large as 2Â cm.  Symptoms included: vaginal discharge, itching, sensation of pressure, appearance of nodules, and sometimes a "popping sound".   The cause is unknown. Histological examination showed the cysts contained pink hyalin-like material, foreign body-type giant cells in the cyst's wall, with chronic inflammatory cell fluid. The gas-filled cysts are identified with CT imaging. The gas contained in the cysts has been analysed and consists of nitrogen, oxygen, argon, carbon dioxide, and sulfur dioxide.  Treatment may not be required and no complications follow the resolution of the cysts.  It may be associated with immunosuppresion, trichomonsis, or Haemophilus vaginalis infection.   Vaginitis emphysemotosa is characterized by gas-filled cysts in the vaginal wall. The first mention of the cyst was in 1877 by Zweifel.
