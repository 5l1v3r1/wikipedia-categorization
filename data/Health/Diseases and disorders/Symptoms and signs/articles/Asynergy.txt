Asynergy is defective or absent co-ordination between organs, muscles, limbs or joints, resulting in a loss in movement or speed. Asynergy is most likely to occur during complex movements, where several individual muscle contractions are needed to act in unison. Asynergy may be caused by cerebellar disorders. In severe cases of asynergy, the result in the patient is decomposition of movement. In order to complete the simplest tasks, a person needs to perform it in a series of individual tasks.
