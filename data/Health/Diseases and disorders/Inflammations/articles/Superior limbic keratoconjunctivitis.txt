Superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis is an ocular disease  characterized by episodes of recurrent inflammation of the superior cornea and limbus, as well as of the superior tarsal and bulbar conjunctiva.    Even though the pathophysiology remains unclear, it is thought that mechanical trauma from tight upper lids or loose redundant conjunctiva could lead to the disruption of normal epithelium.   This mechanical hypothesis is supported by the increased lid apposition of exophthalmic thyroid patients, who are known to have an increased incidence of superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis.   Patients present with red eye, burning, tearing, foreign body sensation, mild photophobia.  Inflammation and thickening of the conjunctiva is observed, especially at the limbus.Lubrication is an effective treatment for this pathology.
