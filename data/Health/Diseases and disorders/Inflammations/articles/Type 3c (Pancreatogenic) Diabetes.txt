Type 3c diabetes (also known as Pancreatogenic diabetes) is a form of diabetes that is being researched.  It involves the exocrine and digestive functions of the pancreas.  Out of all the diabetics, 5â€“10% may actually be type 3c diabetics.  In 80% of people who suffer from this condition, chronic pancreatitis seems to be the cause.  The same complications that occur for other types of diabetics (type 1 and type 2) may occur for type 3c diabetics.  These include retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, and cardiovascular disease.  Patients with this condition are advised to follow the same risk-reduction guidelines as the other diabetics do and keep blood sugars as normal as possible to minimize any complications.

Avoiding toxins to the body such as alcohol and smoking reduce pancreatic inflammation.  Also, eating a diet rich in fiber and consuming normal amounts of fat may help.  Oral pancreatic enzymes may be given.  Maintaining sufficient levels of vitamin D can also reduce symptoms and help manage the disease better. Medications such as insulin may be given in order to lower blood sugars.  For not so high blood sugars, oral treatments in the form of a pill or capsule may be given.
