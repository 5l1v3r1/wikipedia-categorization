Actinic conjunctivitis is an inflammation of the eye contracted from prolonged exposure to actinic (ultraviolet) rays.  Symptoms are redness and swelling of the eyes.  Most often the condition is caused by prolonged exposure to Klieg lights, therapeutic lamps, or acetylene torches.  Other names for the condition include Klieg conjunctivitis, eyeburn, arc-flash, welder's conjunctivitis, flash keratoconjunctivitis, actinic ray ophthalmia, x-ray ophthalmia, and ultraviolet ray ophthalmia.  Conjunctivitis eye condition contracted from exposure to actinic rays. Symptoms are redness and swelling.   Conjunctivitis is prevalent among children of the highlands of Ecuador. The finding supports the hypothesis that prolonged exposure to the sun at altitude—in the less dense atmosphere (with the resultant lower UV absorption)—is the main cause of the disease.
