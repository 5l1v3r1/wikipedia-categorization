Myopericarditis is a combination of both myocarditis and pericarditis appearing in a single individual, namely inflammation of both the pericardium and the heart muscle. It can involve the presence of fluid in the heart.  Myopericarditis refers primarily to a pericarditis with lesser myocarditis, as opposed to a perimyocarditis, though the two terms are often used interchangeably. Both will be reflected on an ECG.  Myopericarditis usually involves inflammation of the pericardium, or the sac covering the heart. The ACAM2000 smallpox vaccine has been known to cause myopericarditis in some people.
