Photophthalmia ( pho·toph·thal·mia (fōt″of-thal´me-ah) ) is ophthalmia or inflammation of the eye, especially of the cornea and conjunctiva due to exposure to intense light of short wavelength (as ultraviolet light), as in snow blindness.  It involves occurrence of multiple epithelial erosions due to the effect of ultraviolet rays,  especially between 311 and 290 nm. Snow blindness occurs due to reflection of ultraviolet rays from snow surface. Photoretinitis is another form that can occur due to infra-red rays (eclipse burn of retina). It can present with the following:  Crooke’s glass  is a prophylactic aid consisting of a spectacle lens combined with metallic oxides  to absorb ultraviolet or infrared rays  and should be used by those who are prone to exposure e.g. Welding workers, cinema operators. The following may provide relief:
