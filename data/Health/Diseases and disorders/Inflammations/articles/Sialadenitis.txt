Sialadenitis (sialoadenitis) is inflammation of a salivary gland. It may be subdivided temporally into acute, chronic and recurrent forms. In chronic recurrent sialadenitis or chronic sclerosing sialadenitis, acute attacks are managed with conservative therapies such as hydration, analgesics (mainly NSAIDs), sialogogues to stimulate salivary secretion, and regular, gentle gland massage.  If infection is present, appropriate cultures should be obtained, followed by empirical antibiotic therapy initially,  for example amoxicillin/clavulanate or clindamycin which cover oral flora. If there are attacks more than approximately 3 times per year or severe attacks, surgical excision of the affected gland should be considered.
