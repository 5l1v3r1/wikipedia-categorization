Dislocation of hip (coxofemoral luxation) may occur in domestic animals. It is a not rare condition, usually unilateral, in: The same illness also exists in human medicine. In dogs, it occurs mainly in an upwards and forwards direction. Hence, the affected leg is shortened, and the greater trochanter prominent. In cattle, it occurs mainly craniodorsally or caudoventrally, but other directions are possible. A typical stance is seen in craniodorsal luxations, with a shortened limb, and a protrusion of greater trochanter. Attempts in reduction in cattle are generally not successful. Affected animals, at least not too heavy ones, can live with the disease for a long time because of the formation of a sort of pseudo-joint in the hip. Dogs with hip dysplasia and unilateral dislocation can live if the other leg is not too severely hit. Then there is a severe muscular atrophy of the  thigh. Compensation occurs with musculation of the shoulders.
