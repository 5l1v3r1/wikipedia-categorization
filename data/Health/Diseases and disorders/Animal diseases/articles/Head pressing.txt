Head pressing is a veterinary condition characterized by standing close to a wall or corner face-first without moving.[clarification needed] This condition is seen in pets such as dogs and cats, and also other animals such as cows, horses, and goats. Head pressing is usually a sign of a neurological disorder, especially of the forebrain (e.g., prosencephalon disease),  or of toxicity due to liver damage, such as portosystemic shunt and hepatic encephalopathy.  It should be distinguished from bunting, which is a normal behavior found in healthy animals. A liver shunt is a congenital or acquired condition that may lead to toxicity and head pressing. Additional symptoms include drooling and slow maturation early in development. Older animals may suffer from liver cirrhosis.  Several viruses that cause encephalitis or meningoencephalitis can lead to the neurological sign of head pressing, see for example Eastern equine encephalitis virus and Bovine herpesvirus 5.
