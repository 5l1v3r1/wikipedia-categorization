The following is a list of mental disorders as defined by the DSM and ICD. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) is the American Psychiatric Association's standard reference for psychiatry which includes over 450 different definitions of mental disorders.  The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) published by the World Health Organization (WHO) is the international standard system for classifying all medical diseases.  It also includes a section on mental and behavioral disorders. The diagnostic criteria and information in the DSM and ICD are revised and updated with each new version. This list contains conditions which are currently recognised as mental disorders as defined by these two systems. There is disagreement in various fields of mental health care, including the field of psychiatry, over the definitions and criteria used to delineate mental disorders. Of concern to some professionals is whether certain mental disorders should be classified as 'mental illnesses'  or whether they may be better described as neurological disorders, or in other ways.
