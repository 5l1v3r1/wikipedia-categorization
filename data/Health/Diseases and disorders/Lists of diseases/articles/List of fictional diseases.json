Fortunately for most of the other sentient races in Babylon 5, their lack of such specialized neurotransmitter cells render them immune to the disease, save for the Pak'Ma'Ra, whose Green Cells were similar enough to the Markab Yellow Cells that a Pak'Ma'Ra died of it on the station.

The disease was named after an island on their homeworld where its inhabitants were wiped out by the disease, an island noted in Markab history for its decadence and immorality. The story of the island was eventually used to frighten small Markab children into behaving. Even accusing a Markab of being infected with the disease can bring shame, paranoia, fear, and an angry response from the accused, and Markab doctors would frequently certify someone's death from the disease as death by natural causes, so the family could avoid a scandal and the implied accusation that they or their family were unclean or immoral.\n</p>\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ecola\n</td>\n<td><i><a href=\"/wiki/Spaceballs:_The_Animated_Series\" title=\"Spaceballs: The Animated Series\">Spaceballs: The Animated Series</a></i>\n</td>\n<td><a href=\"/wiki/Escherichia_coli\" title=\"Escherichia coli\">E. coli</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Ebola\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Ebola\">Ebola</a> injected into a carbonated drink, creating a \"deadly soda that will kill our enemies.\" Drinking the soda causes immediate and profuse vomiting, which then spreads the disease.

A second strain (VITAS II) broke out in the 2020s, killing an additional 10%. Symptoms begin 12 hours after infection and begin with symptoms similar to influenza before developing into severe anaphylaxis leading to death usually by the airways swelling shut. Though treatable with modern drugs, at the initial outbreak of VITAS over 75% of the world's population became infected before a cure was discovered.\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>White Fever\n</td>\n<td><i><a href=\"/wiki/Ravenloft\" title=\"Ravenloft\">Ravenloft</a></i>\n</td>\n<td>A disease that is usually unique to the Core Domain of Valachan. Symptoms include weakness, exhaustion, chills, and loss of strength. Magical remedies cannot cure it, but conventional medicine can hasten recovery. In truth, \"white fever\" is one of many hoaxes orchestrated by Valachan's ruler, Baron Urik von Kharkov, in order to hide his true nature from his subjects. The illness is actually caused by the vampiric feeding of the Baron and his servants.\n</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=List_of_fictional_diseases&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=List_of_fictional_diseases&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><cite id=\"CITEREFSue_Samuelson1980\" class=\"citation\">Sue Samuelson (July 1980), \"The Cooties Complex\", <i>Western Folklore</i>, Western States Folklore Society, <b>39</b> (3): 198\u2013210, <a href=\"/wiki/JSTOR\" title=\"JSTOR\">JSTOR</a>&#160;<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"//www.jstor.org/stable/1499801\">1499801</a></cite><span title=\"ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.jtitle=Western+Folklore&amp;rft.atitle=The+Cooties+Complex&amp;rft.volume=39&amp;rft.issue=3&amp;rft.pages=198-210&amp;rft.date=1980-07&amp;rft_id=%2F%2Fwww.jstor.org%2Fstable%2F1499801&amp;rft.au=Sue+Samuelson&amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fen.wikipedia.org%3AList+of+fictional+diseases\" class=\"Z3988\"><span style=\"display:none;\">&#160;</span></span></span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-2\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><cite class=\"citation web\">Jumamil, Jannah Corrine B.
