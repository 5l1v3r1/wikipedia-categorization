World Cancer Day is an international day marked on February 4 to raise awareness of cancer and to encourage its prevention, detection, and treatment. World Cancer Day was founded  by the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) to support the goals of the World Cancer Declaration, written in 2008. The primary goal of World Cancer Day is to significantly reduce illness and death caused by cancer  and is an opportunity to rally the international community to end the injustice of preventable suffering from cancer.  World Cancer Day targets misinformation,  raises awareness, and reduces stigma.  Multiple initiatives run on World Cancer Day to show support for those affected by cancer. One of these movements is #NoHairSelfie, a global movement to have "hairticipants" shave their heads either physically or virtually to show a symbol of courage for those undergoing cancer treatment.  Images of participants are then shared over social media.  Hundred of events around the world also take place . In 2016, World Cancer Day started a three-year campaign under the tagline of 'We can. I can.', which explored the power of collective and individual actions to reduce the impact of cancer.  Prior to 2016, the campaign themes included "Not Beyond Us" (2015) and "Debunk the Myths" (2014).  2019 will be the start of a new campaign theme.
