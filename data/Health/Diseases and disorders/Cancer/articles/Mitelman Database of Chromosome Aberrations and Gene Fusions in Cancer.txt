The Mitelman Database of Chromosome Aberrations and Gene Fusions in Cancer is a free access database devoted to chromosomes, genes, and cancer. A recent review noted that "It was first published in 1983 as a book named "The Catalog of Chromosome Aberrations in Cancer", containing 3,844 cases. In 2000, it became an online database on open access hosted by the NCI. The information is organized into sub-databases: The "Cases Quick Searcher" lists cytogenetic aberrations in individual cancer cases. The "Molecular Biology Associations Searcher" compile gene rearrangements in cancer. The "Clinical Associations Searcher" is based on tumor type. This database shows raw data. It is very reliable as each case is manually collected by prominent experts: Felix Mitelman, Bertil Johansson, and Fredrik Mertens. Taking in consideration all the progress made in cancer cytogenetics, it would have been much slower without the Mitelman database."   The database was last updated on August 23, 2017, with a total number of cases = 67,625, and a total number of gene fusions = 10,933
