Birk-Barel syndrome is a rare genetic disorder associated with the KCNK9 gene. Signs and symptoms include mental retardation, hypotonia, hyperactivity, and syndromic facies.  Due to imprinting, mutations in the maternal copy of KCNK9 cause the condition, while mutations in the paternal copy do not. As such, this condition can only be inherited from the mother.
