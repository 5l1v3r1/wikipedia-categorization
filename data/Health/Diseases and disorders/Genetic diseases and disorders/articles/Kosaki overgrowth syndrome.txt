Kosaki overgrowth syndrome (KOGS) is a rare syndrome caused by mutations in the PDGFRB gene.  The features of this syndrome affect the face, skin, brain and the body. Face: Skin: Brain: Body: The height, lower-segment, hand, and foot length are all greater than usual. No inheritance pattern has been described as these mutations appear to have arisen de novo. This syndrome is due to mutations in a single copy of the PDGFRB gene. This condition was first described in Japan in 2011 by Watanabe et al.  These authors thought the condition was the Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome but the patient lacked a mutation in the SKI gene. A second case was described by Takenouchi et al in 2015.  These authors recognised that this condition was novel and on performing a whole genome sequecing found mutations in the PDGFRB gene. A further 24 cases were reported in 2017 by Gawli≈Ñski et al.
