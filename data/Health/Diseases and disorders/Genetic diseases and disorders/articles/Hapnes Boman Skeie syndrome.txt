Hapnes Boman Skeie syndrome is a rare genetic disorder first described by Sveln Hapnes et al. in 1980. It is characterized by subcutaneous angiolipomas around the wrists, knees, and ankles.  It is also known as "anomalous insertion of extensor tendons of fingers",  a name derived from the condition that the tendons of the fingers are attached in such a way that the fingers cannot open or close normally. Though the tumors extend deeply into the muscle tissue, joints, and tendons, the tumors did not invade these structures.
