Sclerosteosis is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by bone overgrowth.  It was first described in 1958   but given the current name in 1967.  Excessive bone formation is most prominent in the skull, mandible and tubular bones.  It can cause facial distortion and syndactyly.  Increased intracranial pressure can cause sudden death in patients.  It is a rare disorder that is most prominent in the Afrikaner population in South Africa (40 patients), but there have also been cases of American and Brazilian families.  Sclerosteosis is caused by mutations in the gene that encode for the sclerostin protein.
