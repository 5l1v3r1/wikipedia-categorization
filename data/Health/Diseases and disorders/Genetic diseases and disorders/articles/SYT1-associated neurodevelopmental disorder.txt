SYT1-associated neurodevelopmental disorder is a rare genetic disorder due to mutations in the synaptotagmin-1 (SYT1) gene.  This condition is caused by mutations in the SYT1 gene. This gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 12 (12q21.2).  This disorder is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. Synaptotagmin 1  is involved in neurotransmitter granule release and synaptic vesicle endocytosis. The mutations associated with this disorder seem to affect synaptic vesicle endocytosis function. Epileptic seizures are not a feature of this condition. The head circumference is normal.  The diagnosis may be suspected on the basis of the clinical features listed above.  MRI of the brain is usually normal but the EEG is always abnormal.  The diagnosis is made by sequencing the SYT1 gene. There is no known curative treatment for this condition presently.  Supportive management of its various clinical presentations is the best that is available at the moment. This condition was first described in 2018.
