Dunnigan-type familial partial lipodystrophy, also known as FPLD Type II and abbreviated as (FPLD2), is a rare monogenic form of insulin resistance characterized by loss of subcutaneous fat from the extremities, trunk, and gluteal region. FPLD recapitulates the main metabolic attributes of the insulin resistance syndrome, including central obesity, hyperinsulinemia, glucose intolerance and diabetes  usually type 2,  dyslipidemia, hypertension,  and early endpoints of atherosclerosis.  It can also result in hepatic steatosis.  FPLD results from mutations in LMNA gene, which is the gene that encodes nuclear lamins A and C.       Ankyrin: Long QT syndrome 4
