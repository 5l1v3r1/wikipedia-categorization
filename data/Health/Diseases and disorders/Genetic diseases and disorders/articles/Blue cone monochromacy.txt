Blue cone monochromacy (BCM) is an inherited eye disease that causes severely impaired color discrimination, low vision, nystagmus and photophobia         due to the absence of functionality of red (L) and green (M) cone photoreceptor cells in the retina.   This form of retinal disorder is a recessive X-linked disease    and manifests its symptoms in early infancy.    Blue cone monochromacy is considered a stationary (non-progressive) disease, although there is evidence of disease progression with macular degeneration in many patients.   Cone photoreceptor cells  in the retina are responsible for day-light vision, color vision,      visual acuity and sight in the central visual field. Blue cone monochromacy is a severe condition in which neither the cones sensible to red light, L-cones, nor the cones sensible to green light, M-cones, are fully functional, and only rods and cones sensible to blue light, S-cones, are functional.   A variety of symptoms characterize blue cone monochromacy:         affected individuals show, since after birth, low vision with a visual acuity between 20/60 and 20/200 and poor color discrimination. Phenomena such as photophobia (hemeralopia), which describes the event in which light is perceived as an intense glare, often manifest. Moreover, nystagmus  is present since the age of 2 months and may slowly decrease with age.  Families with BCM-affected individuals show a recessive X-linked inheritance pattern.     The majority of subjects with blue cone monochromacy are thought to have a stable condition, although there are cases of evidence of disease progression with macular changes.    Blue cone monochromacy is inherited from the X chromosome.      The genes involved in the BCM are on chromosome X, at position Xq28,  at the end of the q arm of the X chromosome. The genes’ names are: LCR is the Locus Control Region, and acts as a promoter of the expression of the two opsin genes thereafter.   In the absence of this gene, none of the following two opsin genes are expressed in the human retina.   In addition, it ensures that only one of the two opsin genes (red or green) is expressed exclusively in each cone.   OPN1LW  and OPN1MW   are respectively the genes that contain the genetic code for protein opsin needed  for the capture of light, red (Long Wave) and green (Medium Wave).   The gene responsible for the formation of the blue photopigment is in a position far away, on chromosome 7  and the gene responsible for the formation of rhodopsin (the rod photopigment) is located on chromosome 3. There are many genetic mutations that can affect this group of genes, LCR, OPN1LW and OPN1MW      that lead to the BCM: a deletion of the LCR  ,   intragenic deletion of exons within the genes OPN1LW and OPN1MW  and a 2 steps mechanism with an homologous recombination and a punctual inactivation.   The point mutation is the so-called C203R. The name of the point mutations indicates the position at which mutation has occurred, in this case the amino acid position 203 and which has been replaced, in this case a C = Cysteine with an R = Arginine. The C203R mutation causes the opsin protein once formed does not carry the folding,  that is it doesn’t take the proper three-dimensional form. Other point mutations are the P307L  and R247X.  The last one replaces arginine with the Stop codon, prematurely stopping at position 247 the formation of the protein (nonsense mutation). Other mutations on genes OPN1LW and OPN1MW that lead to the blue cone monochromacy are constituted by a set of point mutations called for example LIAVA.   Blue cone monochromacy will be caused by the production of new hybrid gene, like in the previous case, from the homologous recombination of OPN1LW and OPN1MW. Exon 3 of the hybrid gene contains the following amino acids in the positions indicated: 153 Leucine, 171 Isoleucine, 174 Alanine, 178 Valine and 180 Alanine. This genotype has the abbreviated name LIAVA.  Another disease of the retina that is associated with the position Xq28 is Bornholm Eye Disease (BED).  Finally note there is also a particular mutation of the two genes OPN1LW and OPN1MW which causes a different disease from the blue cone monochromacy. This type of mutation is named W177R and is a misfolding mutation that, if present on both opsin genes cause cone dystrophy with evidence of degeneration and cell death of the cones.  In a male child, from 2 months upwards, an aversion to light and nystagmus  may lead to the suspicion of a case of blue cone monochromacy, but it does not provide sufficient indications to establish the form of the condition. To identify a case of blue cone monochromacy, it is necessary to reconstruct the family history  ,  with the condition linked to the transmission of the X chromosome, if there are other cases in the family.       The electroretinogram (ERG), can demonstrate the loss of cone function with retained rod function.    In adult individuals a color test like a Farnsworth D-15,  a Farnsworth Munsell 100 Hue test  can be part of the diagnosis tools and a Berson test   makes it possible to distinguish blue cone monochromacy from other diseases. Visual acuity is usually tested in adults and is between 20/60 and 20/200.  There is no cure for blue cone monochromacy; however, the efficacy and safety of various prospective treatments are currently being evaluated. Gene therapy is actually the most promising one.   The goal of gene therapy  studies is to virally supplement retinal cells expressing mutant genes associated with the blue cone mMonochromacy phenotype with healthy forms of the gene; thus, allowing the repair and proper functioning of retinal photoreceptor cells in response to the instructions associated with the inserted healthy gene. Corrective visual aides and personalized vision therapy provided by Low Vision Specialists may help patients correct glare and optimize their remaining visual acuity. Tinted lenses for photophobia allow for greater visual comfort.  A magenta (mixture of red and blue) tint allows for best visual acuity since it protects the rods from saturation while allowing the blue cones to be maximally stimulated. BCM is a cause of inherited low vision   with approximately 1/100,000 individuals experiencing the disease within their lifetime.   The disease affects male recipients of the X-linked mutation, while females usually remain unaffected carriers of the BCM trait.     The disease is known since many years. The first detailed description of blue cone monochromacy is that given by Huddart (1777).  The subject of that report 'could never do more than guess the name of any color; yet he could distinguish white from black, or black from any light or bright color...He had 2 brothers in the same circumstances as to sight; and 2 brothers and sisters who, as well as his parents, had nothing of this defect.' Sloan in 1954 studied several patients affected by blue cone monochromacy.   Blackwell and Blackwell (1961)  described patients who can distinguish blue and yellow signals and seems to have functional rods and S-cones cells. Information presented by Spivey (1965)  indicated that affected persons can see small blue objects on a large yellow field and vice versa. The disease has been studied also by Alpern et al. (1960)  and by Fleischman in 1981.  The most important results have been obtained in 1989 and 1993 by Nathans et al.   and by Reyniers et al. in 1991  who identified the genes causing blue cone monochromacy. Following previous important works several research groups worked on blue cone monochromacy with the aim to describe genotype and phenotype features of the disease.         High-resolution imaging of the cone mosaic in the living human eye using Adaptive Optics has made it possible to address the question of how different genetic rearrangements affect the retinal phenotype at the cellular level. Cone Mosaic studies performed with Adaptive Optics technology revealed a disrutpion of the normal pattern of photoreceptors human cone mosaic in presence of the most frequent causative blue cone monochromacy genetic mutations. Adaptive optics images show that the number of visible cones was significantly reduced and the regularity of the cone mosaic was disrupted compared to normals. These imaging data suggest that failure to express opsin results in the early degeneration of the associated cone photoreceptor.     Only in the last few years, blue cone monochromacy has been studied with the aim to find a treatment.   Future treatments may involve gene therapy.   In fact it seems that in case of a genetic deletion of the human cone visual pigment there is a sufficient number of photoreceptors  to warrant Gene Therapy. In 2015 scientists at the University of Pennsylvania evaluated possible outcoming measures of BCM gene therapy  A previous important result shows that in adult primates it is possible to restore colour vision through an AAV gene therapy that introduced a new opsin in the primate retina.  A mouse model of blue cone monochromacy has been treated with gene-based therapy.
