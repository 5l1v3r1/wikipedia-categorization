To date at least twenty five different genes have been implicated in causing GnRH deficiency conditions such  Kallmann syndrome (KS) or other forms of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism through a disruption in the production or activity of GnRH. These genes involved cover all forms of inheritance and no one gene defect has been shown to be common to all cases which makes genetic testing and inheritance prediction difficult.   The number of genes known to cause cases of KS / CHH is still increasing.  In addition it is thought that some cases of KS / CHH are caused by two separate gene defects occurring at the same time.  A table of known genes responsible for cases of GnRH deficiency conditions is shown below. Listed are the estimated prevalence of cases caused by the specific gene, additional associated symptoms and the form of inheritance.   Between 35-45% of cases of KS / CHH have an unknown genetic cause.
