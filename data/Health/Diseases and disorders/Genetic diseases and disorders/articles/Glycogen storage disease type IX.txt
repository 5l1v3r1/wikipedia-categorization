Glycogen storage disease type IX is a hereditary deficiency of glycogen phosphorylase kinase B that affects the liver and skeletal muscle tissue. It is inherited in an X-linked or autosomal recessive manner.  The signs and symptoms in glycogen storage disease type IX include:  Most of these signs and symptoms diminish as adulthood sets in.  Glycogen storage disease type IX can be inherited via:   The diagnosis of glycogen storage disease IX consists of the following:   There are two types of this inherited condition, glycogen storage disease IXa1 and glycogen storage disease IXa2 that affect the liver of an individual.  Mutations in PHKA2 have been seen in individuals with glycogen storage disease IXa2.[medical citation needed] The management of Glycogen storage disease IX requires treatment of symptoms by frequent intake of complex carbohydrates and protein to combat the low blood sugar. A nutritionist will advise on suitable diets. Liver function is regularly monitored and problems managed as they arise. However, liver problems have only been successfully treated by a transplant. Routine checks of metabolism are needed to ensure blood sugar (glucose) and ketones are managed. Regular moderate exercise is beneficial, although over-vigorous exercise is to be avoided, especially in those with enlarged livers.
