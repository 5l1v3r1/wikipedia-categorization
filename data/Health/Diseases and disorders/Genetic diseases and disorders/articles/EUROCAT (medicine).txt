EUROCAT is a European organization that describes itself as "a network of population-based registries for the epidemiological surveillance of congenital anomalies, covering 1.5 million births in 20 countries of Europe".  They were founded in 1979, with the goal of improving the collection of data about congenital disorders, and the standardization of that data.   They have published extensions to ICD-10 Chapter Q, which helps to provide unique codes for individual conditions. As of  2006[update], approximately a quarter of new births in the European Union are reported to EUROCAT.
