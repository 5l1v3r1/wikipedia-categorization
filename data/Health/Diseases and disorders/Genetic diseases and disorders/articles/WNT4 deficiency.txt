WNT4 deficiency is a rare genetic disorder that affects females and it results in the underdevelopment and sometimes absence of the uterus and vagina. WNT4 deficiency is caused by mutations of the WNT4 gene. Abnormally high androgen levels are found in the blood and can initiate and promote the development of male sex characteristics. This is seen as male pattern of hair growth on the chest and face. Those with this genetic defect develop breasts but do not have their period. Mayer–Rokitansky–Küster–Hauser syndrome is a related but distinct syndrome. Some women who have an initial diagnosis of  MRKH have later been found to have WNT4 deficiency. Most women with MRKH syndrome do not have genetic mutations of the WNT4 gene.  The failure to begin the menstrual cycle may be the initial clinical sign of WNT4 deficiency. WNT4 deficiency can cause significant psychological challenges and counseling is recommended.
