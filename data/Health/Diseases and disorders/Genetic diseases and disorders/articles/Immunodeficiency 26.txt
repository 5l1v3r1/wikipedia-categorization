Immunodeficiency 26 is a rare genetic syndrome. It is characterised by absent circulating B and T cells and normal natural killer cells. The features of this condition include recurrent candidiasis and lower respiratory tract infections.  Diagnosis is made by examination of the circulating lymphocytes and gene sequencing. This condition is due to mutations in the DNA-PKcs gene and is inheritable in an autosomal recessive fashion.  The gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 8 (8q11.21) on the minus strand. It encodes a protein of 4128 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 469 kiloDaltons. The encoded protein is a protein kinase that is activated by DNA. This protein acts as a sensor for damaged DNA. This condition is rare. Only two cases have been described up to 2017.  This condition was described in 2009 by van der Burg et al.
