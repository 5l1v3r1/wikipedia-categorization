Pascual-Castroviejo syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive condition characterized by facial dysmorphism, cognitive impairment and skeletal anomalies.  These can be divided into four areas This disease is caused by mutations in the transmembrane and coiled-coil domain-containing protein 1 (TMCO1) on the long arm of chromosome 1. Pascual-Castroviejo syndrome is rare. About 20 cases have been reported worldwide. The diagnosis may be provisionally made on clinical grounds. Further diagnostic tests include serum and urine analysis for lactic acid, a chest X ray (or cardiac CT or MRI) and echocardiography. Biopsies from cardiac and skeletal muscle will show the presence of lipid and glycogen. Testing for mitochondrial abnormalities including adenosine nucleotide transporter deficiency and decreases in the respiratory chain complexes I and IV can also be done.  This condition forms part of the spectrum of  TMCO1 defects. There may be some overlap in features. There is no known treatment for this condition. Surgery may be helpful in treating the cleft lip and palate.  All cases to date have been reported in children. Long term prognosis is not known.  This condition was first described in 1975.
