The Bardetâ€“Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a ciliopathic human genetic disorder that produces many effects and affects many body systems.  It is characterized principally by obesity, retinitis pigmentosa, polydactyly, hypogonadism, and kidney failure in some cases.  Historically, mental retardation has been considered a principal symptom but is now not regarded as such. The symptoms of Bardet-Biedl disorder vary among people within a family. Affected people won't have the greater part of the indications talked about underneath. Moreover, the seriousness of particular indications may shift enormously also. The effects of this disorder include cone-rod dystrophy, postaxial polydactyly, truncal obesity, kidney abnormalities and learning difficulties.
