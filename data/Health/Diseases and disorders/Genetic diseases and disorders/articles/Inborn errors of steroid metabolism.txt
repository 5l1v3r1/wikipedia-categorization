An inborn error of steroid metabolism is an inborn error of metabolism due to defects in steroid metabolism. A variety of conditions of abnormal steroidogenesis exist due to genetic mutations in the steroidogenic enzymes involved in the process, of which include: In addition, several conditions of abnormal steroidogenesis due to genetic mutations in receptors, as opposed to enzymes, also exist, including: No activating mutations of the GnRH receptor in humans have been described in the medical literature,  and only one of the FSH receptor has been described, which presented as asymptomatic.
