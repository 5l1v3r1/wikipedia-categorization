Ring chromosome 20 syndrome is one of the more common ring chromosome-associated conditions.  This occurs when both ends of chromosome 20 are deleted and the ends join together to form a ring. The most obvious feature of this condition is epilepsy.  Epilepsy usually manifests in infancy or early childhood, and usually does not respond well to medication.   Some people with ring 20 chromosome have intellectual disability. A minority of those affected have abnormal facial features, low muscle tone, behavioral problems, or short stature.
