Transitional cell carcinoma is the most common type of bladder cancer and cancer of the ureter, urethra, renal pelvis, the ureters, the bladder, and parts of the urethra and urachus.    It originates from tissue lining the inner surface of these hollow organs - transitional epithelium.    The invading tumors can extend from the kidney collecting system to the bladder.

A carcinoma is a cancer that begins in a tissue that lines the inner or outer surfaces of the body, and that generally arises from cells originating in the endodermal or ectodermal germ layer during embryogenesis. Symptoms vary between individuals and can be dependent upon the stage of growth of the carcinoma. Presence of the carcinoma can lead to be asymptomatic blood in the urine (hematuria),  Hematuria can be visible or detected microscopically. Visible hematuria is when urine  appears red or brown and can be seen with the naked eye. Other symptoms are not specific. Other inflammatory conditions that affect the bladder and kidney can create similar symptoms. Early detection facilitates curing the disease.
