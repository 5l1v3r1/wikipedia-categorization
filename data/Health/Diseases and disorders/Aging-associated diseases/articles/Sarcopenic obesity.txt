Sarcopenic obesity is a medical condition which is defined as the presence of both sarcopenia and obesity.  Sarcopenia refers to the presence of low muscle mass and either low muscular strength or low physical performance. When this is accompanied by a high fat mass the condition is known as sarcopenic obesity.  The symptoms are similar to those of sarcopenia and obesity. The individual may show a BMI that is appropriate and healthy to his or her age but will look fat in appearance. The disease is caused due to a variety of reasons: The problem of diagnosing a person with the condition is hard as there is no reference value for the appropriate lean mass. This is because healthy people tend to show variations in their composition due to their body types. An appropriate weight training and weight loss program can help to improve the patient's condition. The term is a mix of two different words- Sarcopenia and Obesity. "Sarcopenia" meaning loss of muscle and "Obesity" which is the increase in fat percentage.
