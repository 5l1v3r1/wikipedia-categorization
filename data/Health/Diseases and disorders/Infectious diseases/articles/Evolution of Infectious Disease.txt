Evolution of Infectious Disease  is a 1993 book by the evolutionary biologist Paul Ewald.  In this book Ewald contends the traditional view that parasites should evolve toward benign coexistence with their hosts. He draws on various studies which contradict this dogma and asserts his own theory that is based on fundamental evolutionary principles. This book provides one of the first in-depth presentations of insights from evolutionary biology on various fields in health science, including epidemiology and medicine.
