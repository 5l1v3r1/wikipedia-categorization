Epiblepharon is characterised by a congenital horizontal fold of skin near the margin of the upper or lower eyelid caused by the abnormal insertion of muscle fibres. This extra fold of skin redirects the lashes into a vertical position, where they may contact the globe. This is found most commonly in Asian individuals, especially children.
