Pseudohyperaldosteronism (also pseudoaldosteronism) is a medical condition that mimics hyperaldosteronism.   Like hyperaldosteronism, it produces hypertension associated with low plasma renin activity, and metabolic alkalosis associated with hypokalemia.  Unlike hyperaldosteronism, it involves aldosterone levels that are normal or low (hypoaldosteronism). This condition is characterized by hypertension, kaliuresis and reduced plasma renin. This condition has several known causes, dietary and genetic.  Dietary causes include the chronic excessive ingestion of licorice.  Licorice inhibits the 11-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type II (Protein:HSD11B2) enzyme resulting in inappropriate stimulation of the mineralocorticoid receptor by cortisol. Genetic causes include Liddle's syndrome.
