The glandular odontogenic cyst is a rare odontogenic cyst.  In 85% of cases, it is found in the mandible, especially in anterior areas.  It is more common in adults in their fifth and sixth decades.  On radiographs, it can appear as a unilocular or multilocular radiolucency (dark area).  Since the glandular odontogenic cyst can range in size, treatment can be as simple as enucleation and curettage to en bloc resection of the affected jaw.
