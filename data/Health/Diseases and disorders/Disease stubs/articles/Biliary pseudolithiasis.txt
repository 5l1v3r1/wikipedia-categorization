Biliary pseudolithiasis refers to an unusual complication of ceftriaxone where the drug complexes with calcium and mimics gallstones.   It is reversed when ceftriaxone administration is stopped.  It was first described in 1988 by Schaad et al. as "reversible ceftriaxone-associated biliary pseudolithiasis".
