Alimentary toxic aleukia, or aleukia, is a mycotoxin-induced condition characterized by nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, leukopenia (aleukia), hemorrhaging, skin inflammation, and sometimes death.  Alimentary toxic aleukia almost always refers to the human condition associated with presence of T2 Toxin. Alimentary toxic aleukia was first characterized in the early 19th century after affecting a large population in the Orenburg district of the former U.S.S.R. during World War II. The sick people had eaten overwintered grain colonized with Fusarium sporotrichioides and Fusarium poae.
