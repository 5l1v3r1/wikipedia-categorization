Hereditary pyropoikilocytosis (HPP) is an autosomal recessive form of hemolytic anemia characterized by an abnormal sensitivity of red blood cells to heat and erythrocyte morphology similar to that seen in thermal burns. Patients with HPP tend to experience severe haemolysis and anaemia in infancy that gradually improves, evolving toward typical elliptocytosis later in life. However, the hemolysis can lead to rapid sequestration and destruction of red cells.  Splenectomy is curative when this occurs. HPP has been associated with a defect of the erythrocyte membrane protein spectrin and with spectrin deficiency.It was characterized in 1975. It is considered a severe form of hereditary elliptocytosis.  Mutations of the alphaspectrin gene causes this disease.  HPP can be considered as a subset of hereditary elliptocytosis to homozygous and it leads to severe disruption.  Genetic testing for the presence of mutations in protein molecules is considered to be a confirmatory testing technique. It is important to know the risks regarding the transmission and dangers of HPP.  Ankyrin: Long QT syndrome 4
