Thrombocytopenic purpura are purpura associated with a reduction in circulating blood platelets which can result from a variety of causes,  such as kaposi sarcoma. By tradition, the term idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura is used when the cause is idiopathic. However, most cases are now considered to be immune-mediated. Another form is thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Diagnosis is done by the help of symptoms and only blood count abnormality is thrombocytopenia.
