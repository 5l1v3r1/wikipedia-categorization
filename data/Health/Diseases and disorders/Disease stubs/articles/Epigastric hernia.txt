An epigastric hernia is a type of hernia which may develop in the epigastrium (upper, central part of the abdomen). Epigastric hernias usually appear in adults. Unlike the benign diastasis recti, epigastric hernia may trap fat and other tissues inside the opening of the hernia, causing pain and tissue damage.  The primary risk factors are obesity and pregnancy.  Computed tomography scans of the suspected areas with intravenous contrast can assist in diagnosis.  Symptomatic epigastric hernias are repaired with surgery.  Even if they are asymptomatic, they can be surgically corrected for cosmetic reasons. In general, cosmetic surgery on infants is delayed until the infant is older and better able to tolerate anaesthesia.
