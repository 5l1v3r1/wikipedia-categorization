Haemorrhagic disease of the newborn, also known as vitamin K deficiency bleeding (VKDB), is a coagulation disturbance in newborn infants due to vitamin K deficiency. As a consequence of vitamin K deficiency there is an impaired production of coagulation factors II, VII, IX, X, protein C and protein S by the liver, resulting in excessive bleeding (hemorrhage). The disease causes an increased risk of bleeding. The most common sites of bleeding are the umbilicus, mucous membranes, gastrointestinal tract, circumcision and venepunctures. Newborns are relatively vitamin K deficient for a variety of reasons. They have low vitamin K stores at birth, vitamin K passes the placenta poorly, the  levels of vitamin K in breast milk are low and the gut flora has not yet been developed (vitamin K  is normally produced by intestinal bacteria). Precise diagnosis by measuring proteins induced by vitamin k absence (PIVKA). But this is usually not required. Treatment consists of vitamin K supplementation.  This is often given prophylactically to newborns shortly after birth.
