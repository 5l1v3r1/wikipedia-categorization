Eosinopenia is a form of agranulocytosis where the number of eosinophil granulocytes is lower than expected. Leukocytosis with eosinopenia can be a predictor of bacterial infection.  It can be induced by stress reactions, Cushing's syndrome, or the use of steroids.  Pathological causes include burns and acute infections.
