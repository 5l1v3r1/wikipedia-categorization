Platelet transfusion refractoriness is the failure to achieve the desired level of blood platelets in a patient following a platelet transfusion. The cause of refractoriness may be either immune or nonimmune based. Among immune-related refractoriness, antibodies against HLA antigens are the primary cause.  Non-immune causes include splenomegaly (enlargement of the spleen), fever, and recent chemotherapy.  Platelet transfusion refractoriness is typically diagnosed using the corrected count increment, which requires 4 items of information:  The CCI is calculated as follows: CCI= (Post-transfusion platelet count - Pre-transfusion platelet count)(BSA) รท (number of platelets transfused). A CCI greater than 7500 indicates a sufficient post-transfusion increment, whereas a CCI less than 7500 is considered diagnostic of platelet refractoriness.  Immune-mediated refractoriness usually shows little or no increment in the immediate post-transfusion platelet count.  Non-immune refractoriness may show an initial rise in platelet count, but a subsequent 8-hour or 12-hour post-transfusion sample shows a return to the baseline platelet count.
