Band keratopathy is a corneal disease derived from the appearance of calcium on the central cornea. This is an example of metastatic calcification, which by definition, occurs in the presence of hypercalcemia.   Symptoms include pain and decreased visual acuity. Etiologies: Uveitis, interstitial keratitis, superficial keratitis, phthisis, sarcoidosis, trauma, intraocular silicone oil, systemic diseases (hypercalcemia, vitamin D intoxication, Fanconi's Syndrome, hypophosphatemia, gout, 'milk-alkali' syndrome, myotonic dystrophy, chronic mercury exposure). Band keratopathy is seen when there is calcification of the epithelial basement membrane, Bowman's membrane, and the anterior stroma with destruction of Bowman's membrane.  The calcium salts are intracellular when the process is due to alteration of systemic calcium metabolism, whereas they are extracellular when due to local disease. Topical disodium EDTA can be used as a chelating agent.
