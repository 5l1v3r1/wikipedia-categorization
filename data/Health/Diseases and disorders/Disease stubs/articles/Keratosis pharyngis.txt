Keratosis Pharyngis is a medical condition where keratin grows on the surface of the pharynx, that is the part of the throat at the back of the mouth.  Keratin is a protein that normally occurs as the main constituent of hair and nails. It is characterized by the presence of whitish-yellow dots on the pharyngeal wall, tonsils or lingual tonsils. They are firmly adherent and cannot be wiped off.  The surrounding region does not show any sign or inflammation or any other constitutional signs. The disease usually shows spontaneous regression. One patient who was diagnosed with Keratosis Pharyngis had white spots on the base of the tongue and on the pharynx, and hurt a little when swallowing. No treatment was found to help, but the condition went away by itself eventually.
