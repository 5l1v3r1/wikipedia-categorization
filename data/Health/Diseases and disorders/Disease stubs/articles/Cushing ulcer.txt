A Cushing ulcer, named after Harvey Cushing,   is a gastric ulcer associated with elevated intracranial pressure. It is also called von Rokitansky-Cushing syndrome. Apart from in the stomach, ulcers may also develop in the proximal duodenum and distal esophagus. The mechanism of development of Cushing ulcers is thought to be due to direct stimulation of vagal nuclei as a result of increased intracranial pressure. Alternatively, it may also be a direct result of Cushing reaction. Efferent fibers of the vagus nerve then release acetylcholine onto gastric parietal cell  M3 receptors, causing insertion of hydrogen potassium ATPase vesicles into the apical plasma membrane. The end result is increased secretion of gastric acid with eventual ulceration of the gastric mucosa. Diagnosis can be done by Endoscopy. Patients should be put on proton pump inhibitors during the course of treatment until their ICP lowers to a normal level.
