Post-vagotomy diarrhea is a form of diarrhea which occurs in 10% of patients after a truncal vagotomy, which can range from severe to debilitating in approximately 2% to 4% of patients.  However, the occurrence of post-vagotomy diarrhea is significantly reduced after proximal selective vagotomy, specifically when celiac and hepatic branches of the vagus are retained.  Surgical treatment for refractory post-vagotomy diarrhea is rarely needed and at least one year from the occurrence of symptoms should be allotted to ensure all non-surgical treatments have been appropriately explored. Under severe cases, where surgical intervention does become necessary, a 10Â cm reverse jejunal inteposition is usually the procedure of choice.
