Nasal septal hematoma is a condition affecting the nasal septum.  It can be associated with trauma.  Because the septal cartilage has no blood supply of its own and receives all of its nutrients and oxygen from the perichondrium, an untreated septal hematoma may lead to destruction of the septum. Immediate drainage is necessary. Failure to recognise septal hematomas, or treat in a timely fashion, can cause a saddle nose deformity. To treat a septal hematoma it is incised & drained to prevent avascular necrosis of the septal hyaline cartilage which depends on diffusion of nutrients from its attached nasal mucosa. Small hematomas can be aspirated with a wide-bore needle. Large hematomas are drained by an incision parallel to nasal floor.  Systemic antibiotics are given after the incision and drainage to prevent local infection.
