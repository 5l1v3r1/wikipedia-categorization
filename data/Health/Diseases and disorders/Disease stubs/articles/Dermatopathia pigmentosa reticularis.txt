Dermatopathia pigmentosa reticularis (DPR), also known as dermatopathia pigmentosa reticularis hyperkeratotica et mutilans, dermatopathia pigmentosa reticularis hypohidotica et atrophica and dermatopathic pigmentosa reticularis, :511 is a rare, autosomal dominant  congenital disorder that is a form of ectodermal dysplasia.  Dermatopathia pigmentosa reticularis is composed of the triad of generalized reticulate hyperpigmentation, noncicatricial alopecia, and onychodystrophy. :856 Symptoms include lack of sweat glands, thin hair, brittle nails, mottled skin, and lack of fingerprints. DPR is comparable to Naegeli syndrome, both of which are caused by a specific defect in the keratin 14 protein.  see also Template:Congenital malformations and deformations of skin appendages, Template:Phakomatoses, Template:Pigmentation disorders, Template:DNA replication and repair-deficiency disorder
