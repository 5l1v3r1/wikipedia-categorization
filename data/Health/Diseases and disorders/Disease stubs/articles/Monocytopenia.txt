Monocytopenia is a form of leukopenia associated with a deficiency of monocytes. The causes of monocytopenia include: acute infections, stress, treatment with glucocorticoids, aplastic anemia, hairy cell leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, treatment with myelotoxic drugs and genetic syndromes, as for example MonoMAC syndrome.  It has been proposed as a measure to predict neutropenia,  though some research indicates that it is less effective than lymphopenia.
