Lymphangiosclerosis, also known as sclerotic lymphangitis,  is a condition involving the hardening of a lymph vessel connected to a vein in the penis. It can look like a thick cord and can feel like a hardened, almost calcified or fibrous, vein. It tends to not share the common blue tint with a vein however. It can be felt as a hardened lump or "Vein" even when the penis is flaccid, and is even more prominent during an erection. It is fairly common and can follow a particularly vigorous sexual activity. In most cases it tends to go away if given rest and more gentle care, for example by use of lubricants. Even without rest or gentle care, in some cases it will simply disappear after a few weeks on its own.
