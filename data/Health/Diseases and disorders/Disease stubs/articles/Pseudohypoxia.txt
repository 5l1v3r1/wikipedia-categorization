Pseudohypoxia refers to increased cytosolic ratio of free NAD to NADH in cells, caused by hyperglycemia.  Research has shown that declining levels of NAD+ during aging cause pseudohypoxia, and that raising nuclear NAD+ in old mice reverses pseudohypoxia and metabolic dysfunction, thus reversing the aging process.  It is expected that human NAD trials will begin in 2014.  Pseudohypoxia is a feature commonly noted in poorly-controlled diabetes.
