Retrognathia (or retrognathism) is a type of malocclusion which refers to an abnormal posterior positioning of the maxilla  or mandible,  particularly the mandible, relative to the facial skeleton and soft tissues.  A retrognathic mandible is commonly referred to as an overbite, though this terminology is not used medically.
