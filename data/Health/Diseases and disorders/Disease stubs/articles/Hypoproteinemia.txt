Hypoproteinemia is a condition where there is an abnormally low level of protein in the blood. There are several causes that all result in oedema once serum protein levels fall below a certain threshold.  Decreased serum protein reduces the osmotic pressure of the blood, leading to loss of fluid from the intravascular compartment, or the blood vessels, to the interstitial tissues, resulting in edema. This is termed as hypoproteinemia. Hypoproteinemia is often confirmed by testing for serum albumin and total protein levels.
