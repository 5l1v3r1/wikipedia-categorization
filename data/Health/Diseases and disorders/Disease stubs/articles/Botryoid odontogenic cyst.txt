Botryoid odontogenic cyst is a variant of the lateral periodontal cyst.  It is more often found in middle-aged and older adults, and the teeth more likely affected are mandibular (lower) canines and premolars.  On radiographs, the cyst appears "grape-like". Often patients with this condition are symptomatic.  The botryoid odontogenic cyst is a multi-compartmentalized variant of the lateral periodontal cyst.  It is similar to the lateral periodontal cyst in all its features except that its polycystic nature is often evident through its multilocular pattern on radiographs. Histologically also it resembles the lateral periodontal cyst which has a distinctive thin, nonkeratinized epithelium which is 1-5 cell layers thick and resembles the reduced enamel epithelium.  reference can be made to the histologic details given by shear and pindborg
