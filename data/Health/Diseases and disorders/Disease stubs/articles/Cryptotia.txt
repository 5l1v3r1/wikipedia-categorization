Cryptotia is the condition where an ear appears to have its upper portion buried underneath the side of the head.  The condition also involves underdeveloped scapha and antihelical crura.  Cryptotia is also known as buried ear or hidden ear.  Cryptotia is often treated through surgery which involves releasing the ear from its buried position, reshaping the cartilage and using local tissue to resurface the released cartilage.
