Tracheal agenesis is a rare birth defect  with a prevalence of less than 1 in 50,000,  in which the trachea fails to develop. The defect is normally fatal,   although occasional cases have been reported of long-term survival following surgical intervention.   There are three main types of tracheal agenesis, designated Types I, II and III.  In 2013, a case was reported of a South Korean child with tracheal agenesis who had been successfully treated after having been kept alive in an intensive care unit for the first two and a half years of her life. She then had an artificially created trachea implanted that had been created by tissue engineering using her own stem cells.   The patient however later died from complications.
