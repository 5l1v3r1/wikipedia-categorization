An esophageal motility disorder (EMD) is any medical disorder causing difficulty in swallowing, regurgitation of food and a spasm-type pain which can be brought on by an allergic reaction to certain foods. The most prominent one is dysphagia. It is a part of CREST syndrome, referring to the five main features: calcinosis, Raynaud syndrome, esophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyly and telangiectasia.  There are contractions along the lower esophagus when this condition happens. These contractions prevent the passage of food.  Dysphagia could be for solid only or for solid and liquid.
