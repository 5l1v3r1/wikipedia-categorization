Follicular hyperplasia (or "reactive follicular hyperplasia" or "lymphoid nodular hyperplasia") is a type of lymphoid hyperplasia. It is caused by a stimulation of the B cell compartment.  It is caused by an abnormal proliferation of secondary follicles and occurs principally in the cortex without broaching the lymph node capsule. The follicles are cytologically polymorphous, are often polarized, and vary in size and shape.  Follicular hyperplasia is distinguished from follicular lymphoma in its polyclonality  and lack of bcl-2 protein expression, whereas follicular lymphoma is monoclonal, and does express bcl-2 ).
