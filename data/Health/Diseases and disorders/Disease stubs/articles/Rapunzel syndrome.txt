Rapunzel syndrome is an extremely rare intestinal condition in humans resulting from ingesting hair (trichophagia).    The syndrome is named after the long-haired girl Rapunzel in the fairy tale by the Brothers Grimm. Trichophagia is sometimes associated with the hair-pulling disorder trichotillomania.  This syndrome is a rare and unusual form of trichobezoar.  The use of the Rapunzel syndrome first appeared in the literature in 1968.  Characteristics of the syndrome include: Rapunzel Syndrome is caused by indigestion of hair. Trichobezoar can be preoperatively diagnosed. However, the diagnosis of the Rapunzel syndrome has to consider several aspects such as the patient's history with disorders like Trichophagia and Trichotillomania.   The diagnosis of the syndrome is also done by endoscopy. A CT scan is recommended to determine the size and the extension of the trichobezoar.  Because the human gastrointestinal tract is unable to digest human hair, the trichobezoar may have to be treated surgically. Patients usually also require psychiatric evaluation and treatment due to the association with impulse control disorders, especially trichotillomania.
