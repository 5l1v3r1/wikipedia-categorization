A ventricular outflow tract obstruction is one type of congenital heart defect in which either the right or left ventricular outflow tract is blocked or obstructed.  These obstructions represent a spectrum of disorders. A right ventricular outflow tract obstruction (RVOTO) may be due to a defect in the pulmonic valve, the supravalvar region, the infundibulum, or the pulmonary artery.  A left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) may be due to a defect in the aortic valve, or a defect located at the subvalvar or supravalvar level.
