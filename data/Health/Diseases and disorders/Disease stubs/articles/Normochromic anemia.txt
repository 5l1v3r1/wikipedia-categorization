Normochromic is a form of anemia in which the concentration of hemoglobin in the red blood cells is within the standard range. However, there are insufficient numbers of red blood cells. This includes: aplastic, posthemorrhagic, and hemolytic anemias and anemia of chronic disease. MCH (average amount of hemoglobin found in the red blood cells in the body) or MCHC (the average weight of that hemoglobin based on the volume of red blood cells) in these cells are normal, both of which are reflections of the health hemoglobin in the blood. Each red blood cell contains approximately 640 million hemoglobin molecules
