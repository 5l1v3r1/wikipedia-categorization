Lymphohemangioma, or lymphohaemangioma, (from Latin  lympha, meaning 'water', Greek  αίμα (haema), meaning 'blood',  αγγείο (angeio), meaning 'vessel', and  –ωμα (–oma), meaning 'tumor') is a disease characterized by swelling of the lymph nodes and blood vessels. It is variously described as a "mixture of clear fluid and blood-filled cysts",   a mass of abnormal swollen veins and lymph nodes, or a tumorous growth of lymph and blood vessels. It is also sometimes described as a misnomer for combined lymphatic and capillary malformation.  Lymphohemangioma commonly appears in and around the eyes and mouth,  but may also occur in other areas, including the pelvis, urethra, bladder,  and in the limbs. Amputation of extremities may be necessary if the disease renders the extremity non-functional.
