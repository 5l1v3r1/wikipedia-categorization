The foreign body granuloma is a response of biological tissue to any foreign material in the tissue.  Tissue-encapsulation of an implant is part of this. An inflammation around a splinter is part of this, too.  The presence of the implant changes the healing response, and this is called the foreign-body reaction (FBR).  FBR consists of: protein adsorption, macrophages, multinucleated foreign body giant cells (macrophage fusion), fibroblasts, and angiogenesis. It has also been proposed that the mechanical property of the interface between an implant and its surrounding tissues is critical for the host response.
