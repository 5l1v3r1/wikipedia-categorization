Mullerian duct anomalies are those structural anomalies caused by errors in müllerian-duct development during embryonic morphogenesis. Factors that precipitate include genetics, and maternal exposure to teratogens.   Genetic causes of müllerian duct anomalies are complicated and uncommon. Inheritance patterns can be autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, and X-linked disorders. Müllerian anomalies can be part of a multiple malformation syndrome.
