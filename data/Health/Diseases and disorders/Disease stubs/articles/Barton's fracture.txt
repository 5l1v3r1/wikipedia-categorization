A Barton's fracture is an intra-articular fracture of the distal radius with dislocation of the radiocarpal joint. There exist two types of Barton's fracture – dorsal  and palmar, the latter being more common. The Barton's fracture is caused by a fall on an extended and pronated wrist increasing carpal compression force on the dorsal rim. Intra-articular component distinguishes this fracture from a Smith's or a Colles' fracture.   Treatment of this fracture is usually done by open reduction and internal fixation with a plate and screws, but occasionally the fracture can be treated conservatively. It is named after John Rhea Barton (1794–1871), an American surgeon who first described this in 1838.
