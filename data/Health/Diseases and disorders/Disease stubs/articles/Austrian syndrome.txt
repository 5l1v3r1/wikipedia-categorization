Austrian syndrome is a medical condition first described by Robert Austrian in 1957. The classical triad consists of pneumonia, endocarditis, and meningitis, all caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. It is associated with alcoholism, due to the presence of hyposplenia (reduced splenic functioning), and can be seen in males between 40 and 60 years old.
