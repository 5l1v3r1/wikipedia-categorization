Non-cirrhotic portal fibrosis (NCPF) is a chronic liver disease  and type of non-cirrhotic portal hypertension (NCPH). It is characterized by 'obliterative portovenopathy', which leads to various problems such as portal hypertension, massive splenomegaly, and variceal bleeding. It is estimated that about 85% of people with NCPF have repeated episodes of variceal bleeding.  Hallmark of the disease is thrombosis/sclerosis of branches of portal vein. Vessels formed are often termed as mesangiosinusoids or periportal cavernoma.
