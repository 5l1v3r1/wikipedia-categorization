Rhinopharyngitis mutilans,   also known as gangosa, is a destructive ulcerative condition that usually originates about the soft palate and spreads into the hard palate, nasopharynx, and nose, resulting in mutilating cicatrices, and outward to the face, eroding intervening bone, cartilage, and soft tissues. It occurs in late stages of yaws, usually 5 to 10 years after first symptoms of infection.
