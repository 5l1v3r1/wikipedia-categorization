Granulomatous prostatitis is an uncommon disease of the prostate, an exocrine gland of the male reproductive system. It is a form of prostatitis, i.e. inflammation of the prostate, resulting from infection (bacterial, viral, or fungal), BCG vaccine, malacoplakia or systemic granulomatous diseases which involve the prostate. Prostatic secretions escape into the stroma and elicit an inflammatory response.
