Types of biliary fistula include: These may be contrasted to a bile leak, in which bile escapes the bile ducts through a perforation or faulty surgical anastomosis into the abdominal cavity. Damage to a bile duct may result in a leak, which may eventually become a biliary fistula. A biliary fistula often occurs in be suspected in a person who has recently undergone a surgical procedure, Pain may occur if the leaked bile is also infected, which can subsequently lead to biliary peritonitis.
