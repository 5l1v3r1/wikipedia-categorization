Ship Foot or Bruised Toenail is a condition where the toenail becomes bruised, usually as a result of a heavy impact such as from football, being stepped on, or dropping something on the toe. Ship Foot is commonly diagnosed by a discolouration of the toenail, usually black, blue, purple or red. The symptoms are caused by trapped blood under the toenail. Blisters and cracked skin may also occur. The term is believed to have originated on warships during the Age of sail, where it was common for sailors to sustain such an injury from the impact of a recoiling cannon. The condition in those days would have often been accompanied by other foot injuries, such as a fractured toe.
