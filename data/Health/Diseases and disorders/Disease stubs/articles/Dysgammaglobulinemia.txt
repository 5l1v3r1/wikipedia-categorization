Dysgammaglobulinemia is a type of immune disorder characterized by a reduction in some types of gamma globulins, resulting in heightened susceptibility to some infectious diseases where primary immunity is antibody based.   It is distinguished from hypogammaglobulinemia, which is a reduction in all types of gamma globulins.  Hyper IgM syndrome can be considered a form of dysgammaglobulinemia, because it results from a failure of transformation from IgM production to production of other antibodies, and so the condition can be interpreted as a reduction of the other types. peripheral: Purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency
