The denuded area of skin seen around projectile wounds is called an abrasion collar. Though this findings is often seen around rifled firearm entry wounds, some other high speed projectile wounds can also have this finding.  A similar finding is also likely in firearm exit wounds if the skin at the exit was crushed between the outgoing bullet and an unyielding object pressed against the skin over the exit site.  The bullet shape influences the size of the abrasion collar.  High velocity bullets with spitzer tip and full metal jacket are less likely to produce abrasion collar compared to civilian bullets which have a cylindrical round nose.
