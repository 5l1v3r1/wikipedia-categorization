T-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (WHO 2008), :219 previously labeled precursor T-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (WHO 2001) :219 and also known as precursor T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma and precursor T acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma  is a form of lymphoid leukemia   and lymphoma  in which too many T-cell lymphoblasts (immature white blood cells) are found in the blood, bone marrow, and tissues, particularly mediastinal lymph nodes. :635 Labeling as leukemia or lymphoma depends on which feature is more pronounced in a given situation, but has no biological or treatment implication. :635 It is uncommon in adults, but represents 15% of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 90% of lymphoblastic lymphoma. :635 The 2008 terminology dropped "precursor" to avoid linguistic redundancy because the lymphoblast is an immature precursor cell by definition. :219  This article incorporates public domain material from the U.S. National Cancer Institute document "Dictionary of Cancer Terms". aggressive: Sézary disease
