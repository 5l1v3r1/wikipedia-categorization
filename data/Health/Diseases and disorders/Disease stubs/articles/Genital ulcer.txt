A genital ulcer is located on the genital area, usually caused by sexually transmitted diseases such as genital herpes, syphilis, chancroid, or Chlamydia trachomatis. Some other signs of having genital ulcers include enlarged lymph nodes in the groin area, or vesicular lesions, which are small, elevated sores or blisters. The syndrome may be further classified into penile ulceration and vulval ulceration for males and females respectively. Genital ulcers are not strictly a sign of an STD. They can occur in patients with Behcet's syndrome, lupus, and some forms of rheumatoid arthritis (all non-communicable diseases). Genital tuberculosis, often caused by direct genital contact with infected sputum, can also present as genital ulcer.
