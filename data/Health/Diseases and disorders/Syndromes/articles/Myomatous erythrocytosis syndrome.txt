Myomatous erythrocytosis syndrome describes an excessive erythrocyte (red blood cells) production, occurring in about 0.5% of individuals affected by uterine leiomyomas (fibroids). This syndrome is believed to be caused by increased erythropoietin (EPO) production by the kidneys or by the leiomyomas themselves.
