Nezelof syndrome (also known as Thymic dysplasia with normal immunoglobulins :85) is an autosomal recessive  congenital immunodeficiency condition due to underdevelopment of the thymus. The defect is a type of purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency with inactive phosphorylase, this results in an accumulation of deoxy-GTP which inhibits ribonucleotide reductase.  Ribonucleotide reductase catalyzes the formation of deoxyribonucleotides from ribonucleotides, thus, DNA replication is inhibited.[medical citation needed] This condition causes severe infections. it is characterized by elevated immunoglobulins that function poorly.   Other symptoms are:  Genetically speaking, Nezelof syndrome is autosomal recessive. the condition is thought to be a variation of severe combined immunodeficiency(SCID)  However, the precise cause of Nezelof syndrome remains uncertain  In the mechanism of this condition, one first finds that the normal function of the thymus has it being important in T-cell development and release into the body's blood circulation  Hassal's corpuscles  absence in thymus(atrophy) has an effect on T-cells.  The diagnosis of Nezelof syndrome will indicate a deficiency of T-cells,  additionally in ascertaining the condition the following is done:   The differential diagnosis for this condition consists of acquired immune deficiency syndrome and severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome   In terms of treatment for individuals with Nezelof syndrome, which was first  characterized in 1964,  includes the following(how effective bone marrow transplant is uncertain )Â : peripheral: Purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency
