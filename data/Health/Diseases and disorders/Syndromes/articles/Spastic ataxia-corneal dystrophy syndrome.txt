 Spastic ataxia-corneal dystrophy syndrome (also known as Bedouin spastic ataxia syndrome) is an autosomally resessive disease. It has been found in an inbred Bedouin family.  It was first described in 1986. A member of the family who was first diagnosed with this disease also had Bartter syndrome. It was concluded by its first descriptors Mousa-Al et al. that the disease is different from a disease known as corneal-cerebellar syndrome that had been found in 1985.  Symptoms include spastic ataxia, cataracts, macular corneal dystrophy and nonaxial myopia. Mental development is normal.
