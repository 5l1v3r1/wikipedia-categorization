Paraneoplastic acrokeratosis, Bazex syndrome (also known as acrokeratosis paraneoplastica of Bazex and acrokeratosis neoplastica)  is a cutaneous condition characterized by psoriasiform changes of hands, feet, ears, and nose, with involvement of the nails and periungual tissues being characteristic and indistinguishable from psoriatic nails. The condition is associated with carcinomas of the upper aerodigestive tract. :665 This condition should not be confused with the other unrelated disease called Bazex syndrome, otherwise referred to as Bazex-Dupre-Christol syndrome. This was first reported by the French Dermatologist, Andre Bazex (1911â€“1988), in 1945. Contrary to some publications, he did not die in 1944, as a victim of the Battle for France, but instead, was alive and well and continued his research on skin diseases up until his retirement in 1980.
