Griscelli syndrome type 2 (also known as "partial albinism with immunodeficiency") is a rare autosomal recessive syndrome characterized by variable pigmentary dilution, hair with silvery metallic sheen, frequent pyogenic infections, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. :866 All types of Griscelli syndrome have distinctive skin and hair coloring.  Type 1 is associated with neurological abnormalities. These include delayed development, intellectual disability, seizures, hypotonia and eye abnormalities. Type 2 - unlike type 1 - is not associated with primary neurological disease but is associated with an uncontrolled T lymphocyte expansion and macrophage activation syndrome. It is often associated with the hemophagocytic syndrome. This latter condition may be fatal in the absence of bone marrow transplantation. Persons with type 3 have the typical light skin and hair coloring but are otherwise normal. There are three types of Griscelli syndrome.  Type 1 is associated with mutations in the MYO5A gene Type 2 is associated with mutations in RAB27A gene.  Both these genes are located on the long arm of chromosome 15 (15q21). Type 3 is associated with mutations in the MLPH gene. All types are inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. This includes Chediak-Higashi syndrome and Elejalde syndrome (neuroectodermal melanolysosomal disease). This syndrome was first described in 1978.  In 2000 types 1 and 2 were distinguished.
