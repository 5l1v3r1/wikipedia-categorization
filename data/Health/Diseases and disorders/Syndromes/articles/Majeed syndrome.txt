Majeed syndrome is an inherited skin disorder characterized by chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis, congenital dyserythropoietic anemia and a neutrophilic dermatosis.   It is classified as an autoinflammatory bone disorder. The condition is found in people with two defective copies (autosomal recessive inheritance) of the LPIN2 gene. LPIN2 encodes lipin-2 which is involved in lipid metabolism.  The pathogenesis of this mutation with the clinical manifestations has not been elucidated.
