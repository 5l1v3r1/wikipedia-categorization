Raymond Céstan syndrome is caused by blockage of the long circumferential branches of the basilar artery.  It was described by Étienne Jacques Marie Raymond Céstan and Louis Jean Chenais.  Along with other related syndromes such as Millard-Gubler syndrome, Foville's syndrome, and Weber's syndrome, the description was instrumental in establishing important principles in brain-stem localization.
