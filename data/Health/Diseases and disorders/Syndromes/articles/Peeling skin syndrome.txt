Peeling skin syndrome (also known as "Acral peeling skin syndrome," "Continual peeling skin syndrome," "Familial continual skin peeling," "Idiopathic deciduous skin," and "Keratolysis exfoliativa congenita" ) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by lifelong peeling of the stratum corneum, and may be associated with pruritus, short stature, and easily removed anagen hair. :502 The acral form can be associated with TGM5.    Only several dozen cases have been reported in the literature, making it rare, but because its symptoms are mild and similar to other disorders it could very well be under-diagnosed.
