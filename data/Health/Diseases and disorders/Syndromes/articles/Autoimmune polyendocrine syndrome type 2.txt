Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 2, a form of autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome also known as Schmidt's syndrome,  or APS-II, is the most common form of the polyglandular failure syndromes.  It is heterogeneous and has not been linked to one gene. Rather, individuals are at a higher risk when they carry a particular human leukocyte antigen (HLA-DQ2, HLA-DQ8 and HLA-DR4). APS-II affects women to a greater degree than men.  Symptoms(and signs) that are consistent with this disorder are the following:    In terms of genetics one finds that autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 2 has an autosomal dominant(and recessive) inheritance   Furthermore, the human leukocyte antigen  involved in this condition are HLA-DQ2(DR3 (DQB*0201)) and HLA-DQ8(DR4 (DQB1*0302)),  genetically speaking, which indicates this is a multifactorial disorder, as well   Should any affected organs show chronic inflammatory infiltrate(lymphocytes), this would be an indication. Moreover, autoantibodies reacting to specific antigens is common, in the immune system of an affected individual  In terms of genetic testing, while it is done for type 1 of this condition, type 2 will only render (or identify) those genes which place the individual at higher risk.  Other methods/exam to ascertain if an individual has autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 2 are:  Management of autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 2 consists of the following:  Some researchers favour splitting this syndrome into three distinct syndromes (numbering 2, 3 and 4), but evidence for these distinct combinations is not convincing.  The condition was recognized by Martin Benno Schmidt (1863 â€“ 1949), a German pathologist, first described in 1926.
