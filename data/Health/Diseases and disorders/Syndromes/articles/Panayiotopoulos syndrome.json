The child, who was initially fully conscious, becomes confused and unresponsive. Eyes turn to one side or gaze widely open. Only half of the seizures end with brief hemiconvulsions or generalized convulsions. Autonomic symptoms may be the only features of the seizures.

This diffuse <a href=\"/wiki/Epileptogenic\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Epileptogenic\">epileptogenicity</a> may be unequally distributed, predominating in one area, which is often posterior. Epileptic discharges in Panayiotopoulos syndrome, irrespective of their location at onset, activate emetic and autonomic centers prior to any other conventional <a href=\"/wiki/Neocortical\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Neocortical\">neocortical</a> seizure manifestations. An explanation for this is that children are susceptible to autonomic disorders as illustrated by the cyclic vomiting syndrome, which is a nonepileptic condition specific to childhood.\n</p><p>Panayiotopoulos syndrome and all other benign childhood focal seizures, with rolandic epilepsy as their main representative, are probably linked due to a common, genetically-determined, mild, and reversible functional derangement of the brain cortical maturational process that Panayiotopoulos proposed as \"benign childhood seizure susceptibility syndrome\". The various EEG and seizure manifestations often follow an age- (maturation-) related localization. Panayiotopoulos syndrome is probably the early onset phenotype of the benign childhood seizure susceptibility syndrome.\nDuring a recorded autonomic seizure, there was a small increase in <a href=\"/wiki/Blood_pressure\" title=\"Blood pressure\">blood pressure</a> (+5/4&#160;mm Hg, systolic/diastolic), pronounced increases in <a href=\"/wiki/Heart_rate\" title=\"Heart rate\">heart rate</a> (+59 bpm) and plasma concentrations of <a href=\"/wiki/Norepinephrine\" title=\"Norepinephrine\">norepinephrine</a> (+242 pg/mL), epinephrine (+175 pg/mL), and <a href=\"/wiki/Vasopressin\" title=\"Vasopressin\">vasopressin</a> (+22.1 pg/mL); <a href=\"/wiki/Serum_glucose\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Serum glucose\">serum glucose</a> was also elevated (206&#160;mg/dL).<sup id=\"cite_ref-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup> The significant increase in plasma vas#pressin may explain the emetic autonomic symptoms.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Diagnosis\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Panayiotopoulos_syndrome&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Diagnosis\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Diagnostic_tests\">Diagnostic tests</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Panayiotopoulos_syndrome&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Diagnostic tests\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Illustrative_samples_of_EEG_from_14_children_with_Panayiotopoulos_syndrome.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c3/Illustrative_samples_of_EEG_from_14_children_with_Panayiotopoulos_syndrome.jpg/220px-Illustrative_samples_of_EEG_from_14_children_with_Panayiotopoulos_syndrome.jpg\" width=\"220\" height=\"333\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c3/Illustrative_samples_of_EEG_from_14_children_with_Panayiotopoulos_syndrome.jpg 1.5x\" data-file-width=\"256\" data-file-height=\"388\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Illustrative_samples_of_EEG_from_14_children_with_Panayiotopoulos_syndrome.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Illustrative samples of EEG from 14 children with Panayiotopoulos syndrome. Note that spikes may be localized in any and usually multiple brain regions (multifocal spikes). Occipital spikes are common (cases 28 and 37) but these are not a prerequisite for diagnosis (cases 40, 43, 44). Cloned-like repetitive multifocal spike-wave complexes,  repetitive spike or sharp and slow wave complexes that appear concurrently in different brain locations of one or both hemispheres, may be abundant (case 35).  Spike location may be shifting in serial EEGs (case 44). Brief generalized discharges may occur alone or with focal spikes (case 42).</div></div></div>\n<p>The most important determinant of the neurodiagnostic procedures is the state of the child at the time of first medical attendance:\n</p><p>(1) The child has a brief or lengthy seizure of Panayiotopoulos syndrome but fully recovers prior to arriving in the accident and emergency department or being seen by a physician. A child with the distinctive clinical features of Panayiotopoulos syndrome, particularly ictus emeticus and lengthy seizures, may not need any investigations other than EEG. However, because approximately 10% to 20% of children with similar seizures may have brain pathology, an MRI may be needed.\n</p><p>(2) The child with a typical lengthy seizure of Panayiotopoulos syndrome partially recovers while still in a postictal stage, tired, mildly confused, and drowsy on arrival to the accident and emergency department or when seen by a physician. The child should be kept under medical supervision until fully recovered, which usually occurs after a few hours of sleep. Then guidelines are the same as in (1) above.\n</p><p>(3) The child is brought to the accident and emergency department or is seen by a physician while ictal symptoms continue. This is the most difficult and challenging situation. There may be dramatic symptoms accumulating in succession, which demand rigorous and experienced evaluation. The seizure may be very dramatic, with symptoms accumulating in succession, convulsions may occur and a child who becomes unresponsive and flaccid demands rigorous and experienced evaluation. The most prominent acute disorders in the differential diagnosis include encephalitis or an encephalopathic state from causes such as infections, metabolic derangement (either inborn error or others such as hypoglycaemia), raised intracranial pressure and so forth. A history of a previous similar seizure is reassuring and may prevent further procedures.\n</p><p><b>Electroencephalography (EEG).</b> EEG is the only investigation with abnormal results, usually showing multiple spikes in various brain locations (Figure).<sup id=\"cite_ref-14\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-15\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-16\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-16\">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-17\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-17\">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup>  There is marked variability of interictal EEG findings from normal to multifocal spikes that also change significantly in serial EEGs.  Occipital spikes are common but not necessary for diagnosis.  Frontal or centrotemporal spikes may be the only abnormality.  Generalised discharges may happen alone or together with focal spikes. A few children have consistently normal EEG, including sleep EEG.  EEG abnormalities may persist for many years after clinical <a href=\"/wiki/Remission_(medicine)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Remission (medicine)\">remission</a>. Conversely, spikes may appear only once in successive EEGs.  Series of EEGs of the same child may present with all of the above variations from normal to very abnormal. EEG abnormalities do not appear to determine clinical manifestations, duration, severity, and frequency of seizures or prognosis.\n</p><p>There are now significant reports of ictal EEGs in 20 cases, which objectively document the seizures of Panayiotopoulos syndrome and their variable localisation at onset.<sup id=\"cite_ref-18\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-18\">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup>  All these recorded seizures occurred while the children were asleep. The onset of the electrical ictal discharge was mainly occipital (7 cases) or frontal (7 cases)and consisted of rhythmic monomorphic decelerating theta or delta activity with small spikes. The first clinical manifestation which appeared long (1\u201310 minutes) after the electrical onset, usually consisted of opening of the eyes as if the children were waking from sleep. At this stage, usually the children responded, often correctly, to simple questions. On many occasions, tachycardia was the first objective sign when ||ECG|| was recorded. Vomiting was a common ictal symptom occurring at any stage of the seizures but not as the first clinical manifestation. Seizures associated with ictal vomiting did not have any particular localization or lateralization. Vomiting occurred mainly when the ictal discharges were more diffuse than localized. Sometimes only retching without vomiting occurred, and on a few occasions, vomiting did not occur. Other autonomic manifestations included mydriasis, pallor, cyanosis, tachypnea, hypersalivation, and perspiration at various stages of the ictus. Of non-autonomic manifestations, deviation of eyes to the right or left occurred before or after vomiting without any apparent EEG localisation; it was present in seizures starting from the occipital or frontal regions.\n</p><p><b>Magnetoencephalography (MEG)</b>. The multifocal nature of epileptogenicity in Panayiotopoulos syndrome has been also documented with MEG, which revealed that the main epileptogenic areas are along the parietal-occipital, the calcarine, or the central (rolandic) sulci. Patients with frontal spikes were significantly older than patients with spikes on rolandic, parieto-occipital, or calcarine sulci. Follow-up MEG demonstrated shifting localization or disappearance of MEG spikes.<sup id=\"cite_ref-19\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-19\">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-20\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-20\">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Illustrative_cases\">Illustrative cases</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Panayiotopoulos_syndrome&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Illustrative cases\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In a typical presentation of Panayiotopoulos syndrome, the child looks pale, vomits, and is fully conscious, able to speak, and understand but complains of \u201cfeeling sick.\u201d Two thirds of the seizures start in sleep; the child may wake up with similar complaints while still conscious or else may be found vomiting, conscious, confused, or unresponsive.\n</p><p>Case 1. A girl had 2 seizures in sleep at 6 years of age. In the first fit she was found vomiting vigorously, eyes turned to one side, pale, and unresponsive. Her condition remained unchanged for 3 hours before she developed generalized tonic-clonic convulsions. She gradually improved, and by the next morning was normal. The second seizure occurred 4 months later. She awoke and told her mother that she wanted to vomit, and then vomited. Within minutes her eyes turned to the right. Her mother, who was on her left, asked, \"Where am I?\" \"There, there,\" the child replied, indicating to the right. Ten minutes later she closed her eyes and became unresponsive. Generalized convulsions occurred 1 hour from onset. Thereafter she recovered quickly. Her EEGs showed occipital paroxysms, but this normalized by the age of 10 years.  The patient had in childhood infrequent vasovagal syncopes and/or syncope-like epileptic seizures.  At last communication with her, she was 29 years of age and following a successful professional career.\n</p><p>Case 2. This case illustrates autonomic status epilepticus with behavioral disturbances that would be difficult to attribute to seizure activity before the motor focal ictal events. A 6-year-old normal boy had a seizure at 4 years of age while traveling on a train with his parents who vividly described the event: \u201cHe was happily playing and asking questions when he started complaining that he was feeling sick, became very pale, and quiet. He did not want to drink or eat. Gradually, he was getting more and more pale, kept complaining that he felt sick, and became restless and frightened. Ten minutes from the onset, his head and eyes slowly turned to the left. The eyes were opened but fixed to the left upper corner. We called his name but he was unresponsive. He had completely gone. We tried to move his head but this was fixed to the left. There were no convulsions. This lasted for another 15 minutes, when his head and eyes returned to normal and he looked better, although he was droopy and really not there. At this stage he vomited once. In the ambulance, approximately 35 minutes from the onset, he was still not aware of what was going on, although he was able to answer simple questions with yes or no. In the hospital he slept for three quarters of an hour and gradually came around, but it took him another half to an hour before he became normal again\u201d. EEG showed occipital paroxysms and MRI was normal. A similar prolonged episode, preceded by behavioral changes, occurred 8 months later at school. He received no medication. Since then he has been well.\n</p><p>Case 3. This case illustrates autonomic status epilepticus with frequent vomiting witnessed from onset. An 8-year-old boy of mixed race had 2 prolonged seizures at the age of 5 years. The first seizure occurred during a brief nap. He woke up and walked with \u201cshaking feet\u201d to his mother, complaining that he felt sick. Within 2 to 3 minutes, his eyes and subsequently his head turned to the extreme right. His mother recalls: \u201cI asked him to look at me, and he would not. If I moved his head to the front, it would go back to the right. Within a minute he vomited, and his eyes started blinking, and there were also tiny jerks of his body, legs, and arms that lasted for a minute. He became unresponsive to anything I said to him. He then was rigid, and he went to a deep sleep like in a coma. In the hospital he continued to be in this unconscious state, ever so often just getting up to be sick, and straight back down again. He did not start to regain consciousness or be aware of people around until about 3 hours later. He was well the next morning and discharged home.\u201d\t\nThe second seizure occurred 6 months later on a ferryboat trip: \u201cHe told me that he felt sick, and on his way to the toilet his eyes and head turned to the right and he was talking out of context, and then he was sick. I thought he was having another fit. He was still able to converse with me in and out of sleep. He did not become unconscious, but he was continuously sick for several hours. By the time we arrived in a hospital 3 hours later, he was improving; he just seemed tired. The doctors told us that this was due to dehydration, for which treatment was provided. He was normal the next morning\u201d. \nAwake EEG 1 month after the first seizure showed only 1 left-sided occipital and a possible frontal midline spike. A second EEG at 8 years of age showed infrequent central, frontal, and midline spikes during sleep.\n</p><p>Case 4. This case illustrates pure autonomic status epilepticus with EEG midline spikes and subsequent rolandic seizures with centrotemporal spikes. A 9-year-old boy returned from school one day looking tired and pale. Five minutes later, he complained of headache and became agitated and paler. Within 5 minutes, he started banging his head on the wall and soon became unresponsive and floppy \u201clike a rag doll,\u201d as well as incontinent of urine and feces with his eyes widely open and pupils markedly dilated. At this stage, he vomited vigorously. This condition continued on his way to the hospital where he arrived by ambulance half an hour from onset. Three hours later, he was still confused, partly unresponsive, pale, and quiet, and he vomited again. Recovery started 4 hours from onset. He did not convulse at any stage. He was apyrexial, and other autonomic functions were normal. He slept and was entirely normal the next morning, discharged home with the diagnosis \u201cepileptic seizure? probably atypical migraine.\u201d\t\nEEG had midline spikes at central midline electrode. On follow-up exam 1 year later, he had 2 typical rolandic seizures, and EEG showed centrotemporal spikes. At last follow-up at 11 years of age, he was well with no further seizures.\n</p><p>Case 5. This case involved seizures manifesting mainly with syncope-like epileptic seizures without emesis.  A 7-year-old boy had from 5 years of age approximately 12 episodes of collapse at school. All episodes were stereotyped but of variable duration from 2 to 35 minutes. While standing or sitting, he slumped forwards and fell on his desk or the floor and became unresponsive as if in \u201cdeep sleep.\u201d There were no convulsions or other discernible ictal or postictal symptoms.Four EEGs consistently showed frequent multifocal spikes predominating in the frontal regions.\n</p><p>Case 6.  This case also illustrates the features of syncope-like epileptic seizures together with other variable autonomic symptoms (emesis, respiratory abnormalities, pallor, mydriasis) in Panayiotopoulos syndrome. A 5-year-old boy at age 13 months woke up vomiting profusely and then, while he was still in bed, became unresponsive and floppy with shallow breathing for 20 minutes. Later the same night, he woke up, vomited, and then collapsed in the bath. He remained flaccid and unresponsive for 1 hour, and his mother, described him as \u201cflat\u201d and pale with dilated nonreactive pupils. At age 20 months, he collapsed on the floor pale, unresponsive, and flaccid for approximately 10 minutes. On another occasion, he was found in bed unresponsive, floppy, and pale for 5 minutes. The last seizure occurred at age 28 months in the nursery. He fell on the floor and remained unresponsive and flaccid for 20 minutes and then he rapidly recovered. EEGs consistently showed multifocal spikes in various brain locations. Cardiologic assessment was normal.<sup id=\"cite_ref-21\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-21\">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Case 7. This case demonstrates that Panayiotopoulos syndrome can also occur with consistently normal interictal EEGs.<sup id=\"cite_ref-22\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-22\">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup>\t\nAt the age of 2 years, a girl had an autonomic status epilepticus during sleep. This was characterized by pallor, progressive impairment of consciousness, and vomiting that lasted 45 minutes. A second episode occurred after 11 months, during sleep, and consisted of impairment of consciousness, hypotonia, deviation of the eyes to the right, hypersalivation, and right-sided clonic convulsions. It was terminated after 45 minutes with rectal diazepam. Treatment with carbamazepine was initiated. After 6 months, she had a third episode similar to the previous ones, but shorter. At the age of 4 years 9 months, during an ambulatory EEG, she had another autonomic seizure with marked ictal EEG abnormalities, but again, the interictal did not show any spikes. Carbamazepine was replaced with phenobarbital. All 12 interictal EEGs during the active seizure period, 6 of them during sleep, were normal. At last follow-up at the age of 16 years, she was well, a good student, unmedicated, and seizure-free for 11 years.\n</p><p>Case 8. This case illustrates that children with Panayiotopoulos syndrome may be misdiagnosed and treated for encephalitis. This boy had a first seizure at age 4 years and 2 months. Whilst sleeping in his mother\u2019s lap, he suddenly vomited. Then his eyes stared into the space upwards, his head deviated to the right, his face turned green and he became incontinent of urine and faeces. The seizure lasted for 15 min and there were no convulsions. Abdominal ultrasound performed because of the vomiting was normal. A second seizure occurred 16 months later at age 5 years and 6 months. At around 10 in the morning he walked into lounge looking pale and irritable. He fell to the floor and developed writhing movements, shaking arms and legs, hypersalivation and incontinence of urine. Convulsions stopped 15 min later with rectal diazepam. He recovered but remained very sleepy. He was febrile ~38.5&#160;\u00b0C. He was treated in a major teaching hospital with triple therapy for suspected encephalitis but in the third day after admission this was stopped and he was discharged home. Brain CT scan, EEG and CSF were normal.  Subsequent EEGs showed infrequent occipital and frontal spikes.  At follow-up aged 7, he was normal and had experienced no further seizures.<sup id=\"cite_ref-23\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-23\">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Classification_and_nomenclature\">Classification and nomenclature</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Panayiotopoulos_syndrome&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Classification and nomenclature\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Panayiotopoulos syndrome is now the formally approved <a href=\"/wiki/Nomenclature\" title=\"Nomenclature\">nomenclature</a> for this syndrome in the new International League against Epilepsy report on classification,<sup id=\"cite_ref-24\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-24\">&#91;24&#93;</a></sup> which abandoned a number of previously used descriptive terms such as early onset benign childhood epilepsy with occipital paroxysms, early onset benign childhood occipital epilepsy, nocturnal childhood occipital epilepsy.

Half of the seizures were lengthy, lasting for hours (autonomic status epilepticus). The EEG of the 21 idiopathic cases showed great variations: 12 had occipital paroxysms or spikes alone or with extraoccipital spikes; 2 had central spikes and giant<a href=\"/wiki/Somatosensory_system\" title=\"Somatosensory system\">somatosensory</a> evoked spikes; 2 had midline spikes; 1 had frontal spikes; 1 had brief generalized discharges; and 3 had consistently normal EEG. Subsequent attention was focused on the predominant group with occipital spikes, which was established as \"early onset benign childhood epilepsy with occipital paroxysms\". The other group of 9 children with extraoccipital spikes or normal EEGs was reevaluated much later; their clinical manifestations and outcome were similar to those patients with occipital spikes. Based on these results, it has been concluded that these 21 children, despite different EEG manifestations, suffered from the same disease, which is now designated as Panayiotopoulos syndrome to incorporate all cases irrespective of EEG localizations.\n</p><p>However, there was initial scepticism and resistance to these findings, including from influential <a href=\"/wiki/Epileptologist\" title=\"Epileptologist\">epileptologists</a> because as explained by Ferrie and Livingston:<sup id=\"cite_ref-44\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-44\">&#91;44&#93;</a></sup>\"(a) ictal vomiting had been considered as extremely rare and hitherto had been mainly described in neurosurgical series of adult patients.
