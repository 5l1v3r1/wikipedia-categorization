Autoimmune polyendocrine syndromes (APS) occur when more than one autoimmune disease occurs in endocrine glands. These syndromes are also called Polyendocrine Autoimmune Disorders. In Type 3, autoimmune thyroiditis and another endocrine autoimmune disease are present, but the adrenal cortex is not involved.
