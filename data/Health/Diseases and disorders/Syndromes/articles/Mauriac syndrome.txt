Mauriac syndrome is a rare complication of diabetes mellitus type 1 characterized by extreme hepatomegaly due to glycogen deposition, along with growth failure and delayed puberty. It occurs in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes as a result of abnormally high blood sugar levels and the symptoms tend to rectify with attainment of normal blood sugar levels.   Abnormally high blood sugar levels are relatively common among patients with type I diabetes, but Mauriac syndrome is rare suggesting that a factor affecting glycogen metabolism in addition to the high level of blood sugar is necessary to cause the syndrome. A study of an adolescent boy with severe Mauriac syndrome found a mutation in PHKG2 which is the catalytic subunit of glycogen phosphorylase kinase (PhK). PhK is a large enzyme complex responsible for the activation of glycogen phosphorylase, the first enzyme in the pathway of glycogen metabolism. Expression of the mutant PHKG2 in a human liver cell line inhibited the enzyme activity of the PhK complex and increased glycogen levels. The mother of the boy with Mauriac syndrome possessed the mutant PHKG2, but did not have diabetes or a clinically detectable enlarged liver. The father of the boy had type 1 diabetes with abnormally high blood sugar levels and the size of his liver and his growth were normal.  The study suggests that a mutant enzyme of glycogen metabolism in addition to an abnormally high blood glucose level is necessary to cause Mauriac syndrome.
