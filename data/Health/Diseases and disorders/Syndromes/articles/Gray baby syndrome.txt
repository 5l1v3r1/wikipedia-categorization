Gray baby syndrome (also termed Gray or Grey syndrome) is a rare but serious side effect that occurs in newborn infants (especially premature babies) following the accumulation of antibiotic chloramphenicol.  Toxic levels of chloramphenicol after 2â€“9 days result in: Two pathophysiologic mechanisms are thought to play a role in the development of gray baby syndrome after  exposure to the anti-microbial drug chloramphenicol.  This condition is due to a lack of glucuronidation reactions occurring in the baby, thus leading to an accumulation of toxic chloramphenicol metabolites:  Due to these two reasons the chloramphenicol level in blood is increased, at higher concentration chloramphenicol blocks electron transport in the liver, myocardium, and skeletal muscles, resulting the above symptoms. The condition can be prevented by using chloramphenicol at the recommended doses and monitoring blood levels,    or alternatively, third generation cephalosporins can be effectively substituted for the drug, without the associated toxicity.  Chloramphenicol therapy should be stopped immediately. Exchange transfusion may be required to remove the drug. Sometimes, phenobarbital (UGT induction) is used.
