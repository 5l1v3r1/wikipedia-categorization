Hereditary hyperbilirubinemia refers to the condition where levels of bilirubin are elevated, for reasons that can be attributed to a metabolic disorder. An example is Crigler-Najjar syndrome. UGT1A1 gene mutations causes the condition. As a result, there can be reduced functionality of the bilirubin-UGT enzyme. Eventually it causes unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and jaundice as substance accumulates in the body due to the reduced ability of the enzyme.
