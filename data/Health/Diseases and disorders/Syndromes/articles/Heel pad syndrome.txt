Heel pad syndrome is a pain that occurs in the center of the heel.  It is typically due to atrophy of the fat pad which makes up the heel. Risk factors include obesity.  Other conditions with similar symptoms include plantar fasciitis.  Treatment includes rest, pain medication, and heel cups.  It becomes more common with age.  The main differential diagnosis of heel pad syndrome is plantar fasciitis. In heel pad syndrome all parts of the heel are tender while in plantar fasciitis typically only the part of the heel closer to the toes is sore.  Manual therapy and exercise have better efficacy in the long term than electrophysical agents and exercise for function, but not for pain.  Manual therapy and exercise are preferably focused at stretching the plantar fascia.  Foot orthoses however do not appear to help with heel pain.
