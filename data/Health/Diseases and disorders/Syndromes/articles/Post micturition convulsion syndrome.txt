Micturition Convulsion syndrome (only  referred to as a “pee shiver” or “piss shiver”) is a small jerk, most commonly in men during or after a long awaited urination.  It is experienced by mostly males with a very small percentage of female experiencing a similar thing. Several studies by companies have documented pee shivers.
