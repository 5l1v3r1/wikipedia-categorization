Activation syndrome is a form of stimulation (sometimes suicidal) or agitation that has been observed in association with some psychoactive drugs.  A causative role has not been established.    Pfizer has denied that sertraline can cause such effects.   Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) have been used in the induction of an "activation syndrome" (restlessness, labiality, etc.). The syndrome generally represents a state change that encourages suicidal tendencies in people under age 25 during the initial weeks of treatment.  SSRI-induced activation syndrome is well-accepted by clinicians.  Evidence reveal that jitteriness/anxiety syndrome predicts an improved prognosis (level D). Further, people with panic disorder with the syndrome may tolerate doses of tricyclic antidepressants without affecting outcome level D.  Activation syndrome resolves within hours of discontinuing the serotonergic agent and initiating care. However, drugs with half-lives may cause symptoms to persist. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) carry the risk, and symptoms persist for several days.
