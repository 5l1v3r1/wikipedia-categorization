Asomatognosia is a neurological disorder characterized as loss of recognition or awareness of part of the body.   The failure to acknowledge, for example, a limb, may be expressed verbally or as a pattern of neglect. The limb may also be attributed to another person, a delusion known as somatoparaphrenia. However, they can be shown their limb and this error is temporarily corrected.   Some authors have focused on the prevalence of hemispatial neglect in such patients.
