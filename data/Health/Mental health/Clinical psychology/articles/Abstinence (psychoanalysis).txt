Abstinence or the rule of abstinence is the principle of analytic reticence and/or frustration within a clinical situation.  It is a central feature of psychoanalytic theory – relating especially to the handling of the transference in analysis.  As Freud wrote in 1914, The cure must be carried through in abstinence.  I mean by that not physical self-denial alone, nor the denial of every desire....But I want to state the principle that one must permit neediness and yearning to remain as forces favoring work and change.The validity of the abstinence principle has been rediscovered and re-affirmed in a variety of subsequent analytic traditions.   The rule of abstinence has come under increasing challenge by Interpersonal and Intersubjective psychoanalysis,  concerned about the inflexibility of the rule, and the way its relentless application may provoke unnecessary hostility, even an iatrogenic transference neurosis.  Defenders of the rule, against the practice of the warm supportive analyst, argue against the easy seductiveness of being overly 'helpful' in a self-defeating way already sketched out by Freud himself.  The concept of optimal responsiveness – balancing frustration and gratification from moment to moment – offers some mediation in the dispute.
