Delusional intuition  is a term applicable in psychiatry that refers to a thought or belief that when expressed either in society, or as usually in a clinical setting, is apparent as being blatantly impossible or unlikely in that the semantic relations of subjects within the speech content  have no basis in reality, i.e. that is of a  thought that  is delusional. This type of  delusion in the context of the intuitive is rather an experience of faux intuition, the person experiences something that resembles the intuitive, but instead the experience is qualified as delusional. This delusion is also described  as Autochthonous.  This description of a psychological phenomenon, that is as observed in the form of expression  within behaviour abnormally, and communicated in abnormal speech, is translated    from the German Wahneinfall.  Wahn translated is specifically a whimsy, false opinion, or fancy.  Is a term relevant to the fields of psychiatry and psychology and describe the expression of thought(s) that have no apparent basis in inference.    A phenomenological understanding  is of an occurrence that is very much like the expression of the spontaneous occurrence of an inspirational  idea, sprung from the soil,   translated into a delusionary vehicle  with the conviction of "immediate enlightenment" (Leon et al 1989)  that occurs as a delire d'embléé id est complete in the actual instance.   The delusion as defined  autochthonous in this context is known  as  primary  (Jaspers 1963).    The delusion is found described in clinical settings as a description of medical symptom of the psychotic illness known as schizophrenia,   and is known within that milieu as a first rank symptom The delusional ideation sometimes occurs from a prior delusional mood (Fish 1985).   According to the Klaus Conrad 1958 account, grātia gratiam parit, the delusion occurs as a second order development of earlier delusionary thinking.
