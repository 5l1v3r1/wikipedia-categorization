  Freaks, Geeks, and Asperger Syndrome: A User Guide to Adolescence is a non-fiction book about how it is like having Asperger Syndrome. The book was written by the then 13-year-old Luke Jackson who has Asperger Syndrome himself. Luke wrote the book because he thought that there were not enough useful things on the internet about the subject.  The point of the book is to explain that it is fine to be different. Luke goes through the problems that people with Asperger Syndrome face such as trouble reading facial expressions and body language. Luke Jackson lives in a family with three brothers and three sisters and his siblings have related difficulties as well.  David Worling of the Canadian Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry said that the book is filled with valuable information and is useful to have in a clinical library.
