Is There No Place On Earth For Me? written by Susan Sheehan and published in 1982 by Houghton Mifflin,  it won the 1983 Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction.  This book recounts the lonely, harrowing life of Sylvia Frumkin who is diagnosed schizophrenic. Sheehan followed Frumkin for two-and-a-half years, much of which was spent inside a mental hospital, Creedmoor Psychiatric Center, in Queens. It presents outstanding reporting on  what itâ€™s like to be mentally ill and how the mental health system often fails in its treatment of those it was designed to help.  The book originally ran as a four-part series in The New Yorker in 1981 and won the 1983 Pulitzer Prize for non-fiction.
