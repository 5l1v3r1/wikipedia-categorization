Lapse: Confessions of a Slot Machine Junkie is a 13-minute short documentary by filmmaker Jonathan VanBallenberghe. It will premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival in April 2013.  When VanBallenberghe turned thirty-six, he realized that he had been addicted to gambling for a third of his life. He decided to end the problem once and for all. His approach to recovery was two-fold: enter into psychotherapy, and make a documentary about the experience. Lapse is a personal documentary that portrays the fractured state of mind of a person in the grip of a gambling addiction. All of the dialogue in Lapse is taken from psychotherapy sessions that the director recorded. Original music was composed by composer Jason Sebastian Russo. The bands Hopewell and Common Prayer supplied additional tracks.
