Warrendale is a 1967 documentary film by Canadian filmmaker Allan King. It was originally produced for broadcast on CBC Television, but was never shown due to King's refusal to edit out the copious profanity in the footage. The film is a cinéma vérité look at the lives of emotionally disturbed children housed in a facility named Warrendale, in Rexdale, at the time, a Toronto suburb. The facility was considered innovative, and met with approval when it first opened in December 1965. But almost a year after it opened, it became the centre of several controversies in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario, and was eventually closed.  Founder John Brown was a New Democratic Party member of the Legislature from 1967 to 1971. Warrendale won awards at the Cannes Film Festival, and French director Jean Renoir declared King a great artist. In 2002, Warrendale was honoured as a "MasterWork" by the Audio-Visual Preservation Trust of Canada.
