Walk Away Renee is a 2011 American documentary film directed by Jonathan Caouette. It is the third full-length feature in Caouette's filmography.  Intended as a companion to Caouette's first film, Tarnation, Walk Away Renee documents Caouette's cross-country journey with his mother, Renee Leblanc.  Leblanc, diagnosed with acute bipolar and schizoaffective disorder, is to enter an assisted living facility close to Caouette's home, therefore necessitating a move from Houston to New York City.  The film was screened as a "work in progress" at the 2011 Festival de Cannes Critics Week.  In July, 2011 distributor Sundance Selects acquired the distribution rights to the film.
