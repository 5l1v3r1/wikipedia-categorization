Are the Kids Alright? is a documentary film which explores mental health care for children and youths at risk in Texas.  Filmmaker, Ellen Spiro, gained unprecedented and unique access to troubled children and their families, as well as the judicial, psychiatric and correctional institutions.  By following several different families, the filmmakers document the results of the decline in the availability of mental health services for the youth who most desperately need it. Geisler, Erin.
