By the turn of the century 'psychopathic inferiority' referred to the type of mental disorder that might now be termed <a href=\"/wiki/Personality_disorder\" title=\"Personality disorder\">personality disorder</a>, along with a wide variety of other conditions now otherwise classified. Through the early 20th century this and other terms such as 'constitutional (inborn) psychopaths' or 'psychopathic personalities', were used very broadly to cover anyone who violated legal or moral expectations or was considered inherently socially undesirable in some way.\n</p><p>The term <b>sociopathy</b> was popularized from 1929/30 by an American <a href=\"/wiki/Psychologist\" title=\"Psychologist\">psychologist</a>, originally intended as an alternative term to indicate that the defining feature was a pervasive failure to adhere to societal norms in a way that could harm others. The term psychopathy also gradually narrowed to the latter sense, based on interpretations of the work of a Scottish psychiatrist and especially checklists popularized by an American psychiatrist and later a Canadian psychologist. Psychopathy became defined in these quarters as a constellation of personality traits allegedly associated with immorality, criminality, or in some cases socioeconomic success.\n</p><p>Official psychiatric diagnostic manuals adopted a mixture of approaches, eventually going by the term <a href=\"/wiki/Antisocial_personality_disorder\" title=\"Antisocial personality disorder\">antisocial or dissocial personality disorder</a>.

In 1801, French psychiatrist <a href=\"/wiki/Philippe_Pinel\" title=\"Philippe Pinel\">Philippe Pinel</a> described without moral judgment patients who appeared mentally unimpaired but who nonetheless engaged in impulsive and self-defeating acts. He described this as insanity without confusion/delusion (manie sans d\u00e9lire), or rational insanity (la folie raisonnante), and his anecdotes generally described people carried away by instinctive fury (instincte fureur). American <a href=\"/wiki/Benjamin_Rush\" title=\"Benjamin Rush\">Benjamin Rush</a> wrote in 1812 about individuals with an apparent \"perversion of the moral faculties\", which he saw as a sign of innate defective organization. He also saw such people as objects of compassion whose mental alienation could be helped, even if that was in prison or what he referred to as the \"<a href=\"/wiki/Christian\" title=\"Christian\">christian</a> system of <a href=\"/wiki/Criminal\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Criminal\">criminal</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Jurisprudence\" title=\"Jurisprudence\">jurisprudence</a>\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-Toch_4-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Toch-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> In 1835 English psychiatrist <a href=\"/wiki/James_Cowles_Prichard\" title=\"James Cowles Prichard\">James Cowles Prichard</a>, based partly on Pinel's publications, developed a broad category of mental disorder he called <a href=\"/wiki/Moral_insanity\" title=\"Moral insanity\">moral insanity</a> - a \"madness\" of emotional or social dispositions without significant <a href=\"/wiki/Delusions\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Delusions\">delusions</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Hallucinations\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hallucinations\">hallucinations</a>. Generally Prichard referred more to eccentric behaviour than, as had Pinel, out of control passions. Prichard's diagnosis came into widespread use in Europe for several decades. None of these concepts are comparable to current specific constructs of psychopathy, or even to the broader category of personality disorders. Moreover, \"moral\" did not necessarily refer at that time to morality but to the psychological or emotional faculties.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In the latter half of the 19th century the (pseudo) scientific study of individuals thought to lack a conscience flourished. Notably the Italian physician <a href=\"/wiki/Cesare_Lombroso\" title=\"Cesare Lombroso\">Cesare Lombroso</a> rejected the view that criminality could occur in anyone and sought to identify particular \"<a href=\"/wiki/Born_criminal\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Born criminal\">born criminals</a>\" who he thought showed certain physical signs, such as proportionately long arms or a low and narrow forehead.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> By the beginning of the 20th century the English psychiatrist <a href=\"/wiki/Henry_Maudsley\" title=\"Henry Maudsley\">Henry Maudsley</a> was writing about not just \"moral insanity\" but the \"moral imbecile\" and \"criminal psychosis\", conditions he believed were genetic in origin and impervious to punishment or correction, and which he applied to the lower <a href=\"/wiki/Social_class\" title=\"Social class\">class</a> of chronic offenders by comparison to \"the higher <a href=\"/wiki/Industry\" title=\"Industry\">industrial</a> classes\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-Toch_4-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Toch-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"First_uses_of_term\">First uses of term</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=History_of_psychopathy&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: First uses of term\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Initially physicians who specialised in mental disorders might be referred to as psychopaths (e.g. the <i>American Journal of the Medical Sciences</i> in 1864) and their hospitals as psychopathic institutions (compare to the etymologically similar use of the term <a href=\"/wiki/Homeopathic\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Homeopathic\">homeopathic</a>). Treatments of physical conditions by psychological or spiritualist methods might be referred to as psychopathic.<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Up to the 1840s, the term psychopathy was also used in a way consistent with its <a href=\"/wiki/Etymology\" title=\"Etymology\">etymology</a> to refer to any illness of the mind. German psychiatrist <a href=\"/wiki/Von_Feuchtersleben\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Von Feuchtersleben\">von Feuchtersleben</a>'s (1845) <i>The Principles of Medical Psychology</i>, which was translated into English, used it in this sense, as well as the roughly equivalent new term <a href=\"/wiki/Psychosis\" title=\"Psychosis\">psychosis</a>, now traced back to <a href=\"/wiki/Karl_Friedrich_Canstatt\" title=\"Karl Friedrich Canstatt\">Karl Friedrich Canstatt</a>'s <i>Handbuch der Medicinischen Klinik</i> (1841).<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> <a href=\"/wiki/William_Griesinger\" title=\"William Griesinger\">William Griesinger</a> (1868) and <a href=\"/wiki/Krafft-Ebing\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Krafft-Ebing\">Krafft-Ebing</a> (1886) also notably employed the term in distinct ways.\n</p><p>The use of the term in a criminological context was popularised by a high-profile legal case in Russia between 1883 and 1885, concerning the murder of a girl who had previously lived in Britain for some time, Sarah Becker (Sarra Bekker). The owner of the <a href=\"/wiki/Pawnbroker\" title=\"Pawnbroker\">pawnbroker</a> shop in which she worked and where her body was found, a retired military man Mr Mironovich, was eventually convicted on circumstantial evidence and imprisoned. In the meantime, however, a Ms Semenova had handed herself in saying she had killed Becker while trying to steal jewellery with h
