The founders of WANA found themselves pushed aside by professionals with money and influence, who made them \"members\" of the new organization. During that period, people who received psychiatric treatment identified themselves as patients, and this term was generally unchallenged as a self-description until the 1970s. A patronizing attitude by some health care workers led to resentment among some current and former patients, which eventually found expression in more militant groups beginning in the early 1970s.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Reaume2002_14-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Reaume2002-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Originated by crusaders in periods of liberal social change, and appealing not so much to other sufferers as to elite groups with power, when the early reformer's energy or influence waned, mental patients were again mostly friendless and forgotten.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Dain1989_9-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Dain1989-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"1950s_to_1970s\">1950s to 1970s</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Psychiatric_survivors_movement&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: 1950s to 1970s\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The 1950s saw the reduction in the use of <a href=\"/wiki/Lobotomy\" title=\"Lobotomy\">lobotomy</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Electroconvulsive_therapy\" title=\"Electroconvulsive therapy\">shock therapy</a>.

Towards the 1960s, <a href=\"/wiki/Psychiatric_medication\" title=\"Psychiatric medication\">psychiatric medications</a> came into widespread use and also caused controversy relating to adverse effects and misuse. There were also associated moves away from large psychiatric institutions to community-based services (later to become a full-scale <a href=\"/wiki/Deinstitutionalization\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Deinstitutionalization\">deinstitutionalization</a>), which sometimes empowered service users, although community-based services were often deficient.\n</p><p>Coming to the fore in the 1960s, an <a href=\"/wiki/Anti-psychiatry\" title=\"Anti-psychiatry\">anti-psychiatry</a> movement challenged the fundamental claims and practices of mainstream psychiatry.

For a time, the movement shared aims and practices with \"radical therapists\", who tended to be <a href=\"/wiki/Marxist\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Marxist\">Marxist</a>. However, the consumer/survivor/ex-patients gradually felt that the radical therapists did not necessarily share the same goals and were taking over, and they broke away from them in order to maintain independence.\n</p><p>By the 1970s, the <a href=\"/wiki/Feminism\" title=\"Feminism\">women's movement</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Gay_activism\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Gay activism\">gay rights movement</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Disability\" title=\"Disability\">disability rights movements</a> had emerged. It was in this context that former mental patients began to organize groups with the common goals of fighting for patients' rights and against forced treatment, stigma and discrimination, and often to promote peer-run services as an alternative to the traditional mental health system. Unlike professional mental health services, which were usually based on the <a href=\"/wiki/Medical_model\" title=\"Medical model\">medical model</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Peer_support\" title=\"Peer support\">peer-run services</a> were based on the principle that individuals who have shared similar experiences can help themselves and each other through self-help and mutual support. Many of the individuals who organized these early groups identified themselves as psychiatric survivors. Their groups had names such as Insane Liberation Front and the Network Against Psychiatric Assault.\n</p><p>In 1971 the <a href=\"/wiki/Scottish_Union_of_Mental_Patients\" title=\"Scottish Union of Mental Patients\">Scottish Union of Mental Patients</a> was founded.<sup id=\"cite_ref-AR_15-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-AR-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup>  In 1973 some of those involved founded the <a href=\"/wiki/Mental_Patients%27_Union\" title=\"Mental Patients&#39; Union\">Mental Patients' Union</a> in London.<sup id=\"cite_ref-16\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-16\">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Dorothy Weiner and about 10 others, including Tom Wittick, established the Insane Liberation Front in the spring of 1970 in <a href=\"/wiki/Portland,_Oregon\" title=\"Portland, Oregon\">Portland, Oregon</a>.

News that former inmates of mental institutions were organizing was carried to other parts of North America. Individuals such as Howard Geld, known as Howie the Harp for his harmonica playing, left Portland where he been involved in ILF to return to his native New York to help found the Mental Patients Liberation Project in 1971. During the early 1970s, groups spread to California, New York, and Boston, which were primarily <a href=\"/wiki/Antipsychiatry\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Antipsychiatry\">antipsychiatry</a>, opposed to forced treatment including forced drugging, shock treatment and involuntary committal.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Reaume2002_14-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Reaume2002-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup> In 1972, the first organized group in <a href=\"/wiki/Canada\" title=\"Canada\">Canada</a>, the Mental Patients Association, started to publish In A Nutshell, while in the US the first edition of the first national publication by ex-mental patients, Madness Network News, was published in Oakland, continuing until 1986.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Reaume2002_14-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Reaume2002-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Some all-women groups developed around this time such as Women Against Psychiatric Assault, begun in 1975 in San Francisco.<sup id=\"cite_ref-17\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-17\">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In 1978 <a href=\"/wiki/Judi_Chamberlin\" title=\"Judi Chamberlin\">Judi Chamberlin</a>'s book <i>On Our Own: Patient Controlled Alternatives to the Mental Health System</i> was published.

It has been suggested that other activists were often more anarchistic and anti-capitalist, felt more cut off from society and more like a minority with more in common with the poor, ethnic minorities, feminists, prisoners &amp; gay rights than with the white middle classes. The leaders were sometimes considered to be merely reformist and, because of their \"stratified position\" within society, to be uncomprehending of the problems of the poor. The \"radicals\" saw no sense in seeking solutions within a capitalist system that creates mental problems. However, they were united in considering society and psychiatric domination to be the problem, rather than people designated mentally ill.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Dain1989_9-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Dain1989-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Some activists condemned psychiatry under any conditions, voluntary or involuntary, while others believed in the right of people to undergo psychiatric treatment on a voluntary basis. Voluntary psychotherapy, at the time mainly psychoanalysis, did not therefore come under the same severe attack as the somatic therapies.  The ex-patients emphasized individual support from other patients; they espoused assertiveness, liberation, and equality; and they advocated user-controlled services as part of a totally voluntary continuum. However, although the movement espoused <a href=\"/wiki/Egalitarianism\" title=\"Egalitarianism\">egalitarianism</a> and opposed the concept of leadership, it is said to have developed a cadre of known, articulate, and literate men and women who did the writing, talking, organizing, and contacting. Very much the product of the rebellious, populist, anti-elitist mood of the 1960s, they strived above all for self-determination and self-reliance. In general, the work of some psychiatrists, as well as the lack of criticism by the psychiatric establishment, was interpreted as an abandonment of a moral commitment to do no harm. There was anger and resentment toward a profession that had the authority to label them as mentally disabled and was perceived as infantilizing them and disregarding their wishes.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Dain1989_9-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Dain1989-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"1980s_and_1990s\">1980s and 1990s</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Psychiatric_survivors_movement&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: 1980s and 1990s\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>By the 1980s, individuals who considered themselves \"consumers\" of mental health services rather than passive \"patients\" had begun to organize self-help/advocacy groups and peer-run services. While sharing some of the goals of the earlier movement, consumer groups did not seek to abolish the traditional mental health system, which they believed was necessary. Instead, they wanted to reform it and have more choice. Consumer groups encouraged their members to learn as much as possible about the mental health system so that they could gain access to the best services and treatments available. In 1985, the National Mental Health Consumers' Association was formed in the United States.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Reaume2002_14-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Reaume2002-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>A 1986 report on developments in the United States noted that \"there are now three national organizations ...
