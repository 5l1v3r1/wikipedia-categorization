The Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance (DBSA), formerly the National Depressive and Manic Depressive Association (NDMDA), is a non-profit organization providing support groups for people with depression or bipolar disorder as well as their friends and family. DBSA's scope, also includes outreach, education and advocacy regarding depression and bipolar disorder.  DBSA employs a small staff and operates with the guidance of a Scientific Advisory Board.  DBSA sponsors online  and "face to face"  support groups. A nonrandomized study found participants in such groups reported their coping skills, medication compliance, and acceptance of their illness correlated with participation. Member hospitalization decreased by 49% (from 82% to 33%).  Following an initial meeting, members were found to be 6.8 times more likely to attend subsequent meetings if accompanied by a member the first time.  DBSA is a not-for-profit 501(c)(3) organization that answers more than 3,000 calls per month on their toll-free information and referral line and receives over 21 million hits per year on their combined websites. Each month, DBSA distributes nearly 20,000 educational materials free of charge to anyone requesting information about mood disorders. DBSA reaches nearly five million people through their educational materials and programs, exhibit materials, and media activities.
