The Common Veterinary Entry Document (CVED) is the official document used in all member states of the European Union (EU) to pre-notify the arrival of each consignment  of live animals (pets not included), live animal products and products of animal origin intended for import to or transit through the EU from third countries.  A CVED can be submitted on paper or by electronic means using the application TRACES (TRAde Control and Expert System).
