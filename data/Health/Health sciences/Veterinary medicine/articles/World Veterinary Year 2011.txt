 World Veterinary Year was celebrated in 2011, in recognition of the 250th anniversary of the founding of the worldâ€™s first veterinary school in Lyon, France, in 1761.  World Veterinary Year was officially launched on 24 January 2011 in Versailles, France.  The slogan was "Vet for health, Vet for food, Vet for the planet!"  The United States Congress proclaimed 2011 as World Veterinary Year, following a proposal by Senators John Ensign and Kurt Schrader, both veterinarians.  The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and DG SANCO held a photography competition early in 2011 entitled "Vets in your daily life" as part of World Veterinary Year 2011.  The competition was won by Indian photographer Somenath Mukhopadhyay, with a photograph of a veterinarian taking the temperature of a goat affected by peste des petits ruminants.
