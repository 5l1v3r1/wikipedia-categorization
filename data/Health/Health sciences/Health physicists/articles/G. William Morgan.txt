G. William Morgan, also known as George William Morgan, health physicist and founding member of the Health Physics Society. Morgan held key health physics positions at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the Manhattan Project and the Atomic Energy Commission. Morgan was instrumental in developing the regulations that we know today as I0 CFR 20, the Standards for Protection against Radiation. When G. William Morgan died in 1984, his will established a substantial fund for the Health Physics Society. The will required that interest from the fund be utilized to have internationally recognized experts present papers at the Society's meetings.  Michael C. O'Riordan from the United Kingdom's National Radiation Protection Board was the first international expert to receive support from the HPS through the Morgan Fund. O'Riordan presented "Radon in Albion" as part of the Indoor Radon Session at the 1989 HPS Annual Meeting in Albuquerque, New Mexico.    Morgan was a Charter member of the Health Physics Society and during the Society's formative years was an active member. He began his health physics career at Oak Ridge National Laboratory as part of the Manhattan Project. He later joined the Atomic Energy Commission and was instrumental in the development of the preliminary regulations that became I0 CFR 20, Standards for Protection against Radiation. He was a great champion of education and helped establish the AEC Health Physics Fellowship Program. After retirement, Morgan became successful in the real estate, but maintained an interest in health physics. The Health Physics Society's Presidents Emeritus Committee has responsibility for the selection of the international expert who will be supported by the G. William Morgan Trust Fund each year. The endowment fund was established in 1984 with $100,000 and during the period 2000-2005 the fund grew to $200,000.
