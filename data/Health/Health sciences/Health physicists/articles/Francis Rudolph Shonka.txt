He was offered and accepted the position of Professor of Physics at St. Procopius College and taught there for 2 years. He attended the University of Chicago during this time and graduated in 1933 with the M.S. degree in physics. Shonka was presented with the opportunity to teach in China, so he traveled to Peiping, China to become Professor and Head of the Physics Department at Fu Jen University for the following 2 years. After China, Shonka returned to St. Procopius College to again teach physics for an additional 2 years. Shonka accepted a position at DePaul University and taught physics for 5 years. Shonka attended the University of Chicago for doctoral studies and in 1941 was awarded a Ph.D. in physics. Arthur H. Compton was his advisor.  Shonka went to the Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago and was promoted to Director, Instrument Research and Development Division. In 1954, Shonka advance to become Director of Research, Physical Science Laboratory at St. Procopius College and remained in this position until he died in 1970.
