A Certified Health Physicist is designated by the letters CHP or DABHP (Diplomat of the American Board of Health Physics) after his or her name. A certification by the ABHP is not a license to practice and does not confer any legal qualification to practice health physics. However, the certification is well respected and indicates a high level of achievement by those who obtain it.  Certified Health Physicists are plenary or emeritus members of the American Academy of Health Physics (AAHP). In 2015, the AAHP web site listed over 1500 plenary and emeritus members.
