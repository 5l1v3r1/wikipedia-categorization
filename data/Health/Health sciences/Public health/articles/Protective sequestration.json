The duration of the quarantine period is determined by the incubation period of the infection, i.e., the time between acquisition of the infectious agent and the development of signs or symptoms of the illness caused by that agent.\n</p><p>During the <a href=\"/wiki/1918_flu_pandemic\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"1918 flu pandemic\">1918 flu pandemic</a>, factors that contributed to the rare successes of protective sequestration were the following:\n</p>\n<ul><li>The community leader(s) recognized the danger posed by the pandemic before it reached the community and implemented protective measures early (before neighboring communities did)</li>\n<li>Taking advantage of the community\u2019s remoteness or natural barriers that were generally, but not always, present, the community leadership established and enforced a cordon around the outer perimeter of the community</li>\n<li>Anyone seeking entry into the community was placed in quarantine for the incubation period of the infection and released into the community only after they were shown to be free of infection. Furthermore, the leadership established a system whereby supplies were delivered and received in a way that eliminated human-to-human contact with those delivering the supplies</li>\n<li>Families were kept together so that life within the protected zone was as normal as possible. Schools remained in session and places of worship remained open, people continued to work, and entertainment remained available</li>\n<li>Protective sequestration measures remained in effect for the duration of the risk.</li></ul>\n<p>The best known historical example is the measures taken by the town of <a href=\"/wiki/Gunnison,_Colorado\" title=\"Gunnison, Colorado\">Gunnison, Colorado</a> during the 1918 influenza epidemic. To prevent an introduction of the infection, the town isolated itself from the surrounding area for two months at the end of 1918. All highways were barricaded near the county lines. Train conductors warned all passengers that if they stepped outside of the train in Gunnison, they would be arrested and quarantined for five days. As a result of the isolation, no one died of influenza in Gunnison during the epidemic.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> Several other communities adopted similar measures.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Markel_1-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Markel-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>An advantage of protective sequestration is that it shields selected people from infection and possibly buys them time for the development and distribution of drugs or vaccine. A disadvantage, apart from its elitism and social and economic cost, is that those sequestered have no opportunity to develop naturally-acquired immunity to the infectious agent through contact with it, and, therefore, they remain susceptible to the agent during subsequent waves of the epidemic or pandemic.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Protective_sequestration&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-Markel-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\">^ <a href=\"#cite_ref-Markel_1-0\"><sup><i><b>a</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Markel_1-1\"><sup><i><b>b</b></i></sup></a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/12/12/pdfs/06-0506.pdf\">H.
