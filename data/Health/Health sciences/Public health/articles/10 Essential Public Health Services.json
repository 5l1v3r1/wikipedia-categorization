1988, the <a href=\"/wiki/Institute_of_Medicine\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Institute of Medicine\">Institute of Medicine</a> (IOM) released an assessment of the U.S. public health system titled, <i>The Future of Public Health</i>. The report described the network of county, state, and national public health agencies as being in \"disarray\" and prompted a national discussion about the state of public health in the country. Questioning the ability of existing public health systems to provide essential services, the report sought to establish a comprehensive framework delineating the \"three fundamental purposes of public health.\" These purposes included \"assessment, policy development, and assurance.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-iii_2-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-iii-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Though health policy academicians identified with and understood the IOM framework, policy makers found its highly conceptual language difficult to apply. Therefore, as part of President Clinton\u2019s 1994 healthcare reform efforts, a federal working-group was tasked with reviewing and supplementing the framework. Under the auspices of both the <a href=\"/wiki/Center_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Center for Disease Control and Prevention\">Center for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s</a> (CDC) Public Health Practice Program Office and the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, the group sought to\n</p>\n<ol><li>explain what public health is,</li>\n<li>clarify the role of public health within the larger healthcare system, and</li>\n<li>provide accountability by linking public health performance to health outcomes.</li></ol>\n<p>These efforts culminated in the publication of <i>The Essential Services of Public Health</i> in late 1994.<sup id=\"cite_ref-iv_3-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-iv-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\nPublic Health Units\n<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\nThe report was well received. Public health agencies and professional organizations began to align guidelines and employ self-assessment tools in support of the ten Essential Services.<sup id=\"cite_ref-v_5-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-v-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> The CDC launched a number of research projects aimed at developing strategies for measuring how well public health agencies provided the services. Many of these studies were the first of their kind and ushered in an era of health agency monitoring and assessment.<sup id=\"cite_ref-vi_6-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-vi-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-vii_7-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-vii-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-viii_8-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-viii-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In 2002, the CDC and several national public health associations launched the <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nphpsp/\">National Public Health Performance Standards Program (NPHPSP)</a>. With the goal of developing a consensus-based set of performance standards for state and local public health delivery systems, the NPHPSP adopted the Essential Public Health Services as \"the fundamental framework\" underpinning its assessment strategy. The NPHPSP consists of three instruments \u2014 The State Public Health System Assessment, The Local Public Health System Assessment, and The Local Public Health Governance Assessment \u2014 and covers the gamut of public health action as described by the Essential Public Health Services.<sup id=\"cite_ref-i_1-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-i-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"List_of_services\">List of services</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=10_Essential_Public_Health_Services&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: List of services\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Monitor_and_evaluate_health_status_to_identify_community_health_problems\">Monitor and evaluate health status to identify community health problems</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=10_Essential_Public_Health_Services&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Monitor and evaluate health status to identify community health problems\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>It is essential for public health organizations to monitor and evaluate the health status of populations in order to identify trends and to target health resources. Components of this service include: utilization of appropriate tools to interpret and disseminate data to audiences of interest; collaboration in integrating and managing public health; and accurate and periodic assessment of the community\u2019s health status.<sup id=\"cite_ref-i_1-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-i-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> Specifically, public health organizations can monitor and evaluate the health status of their populations by creating a disease reporting system, community health profiles, and health surveys. For example, the Los Angeles Department of Public Health completes a Los Angeles County Health Survey (LACHS) every two to four years to obtain population-based data.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ix_9-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ix-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> This information is used for public health assessment and planning and for evaluating changes in health over time in Los Angeles County.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Diagnose_and_investigate_health_problems_and_health_hazards_in_the_community\">Diagnose and investigate health problems and health hazards in the community</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=10_Essential_Public_Health_Services&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Diagnose and investigate health problems and health hazards in the community\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In order to appropriately allocate public health resources, it is essential to diagnose and investigate health problems and hazards in the community. Components in this service include: population-based screening of diseases; access to public health laboratories capable of completing rapid screening and high volume testing; and epidemiologic investigations of disease outbreaks and patterns of disease.<sup id=\"cite_ref-i_1-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-i-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> The Los Angeles County Health and Examination Survey (LA HANES) was piloted in 2011 and aims to establish a profile description of health outcomes of residents of Los Angeles County (e.g. adult obesity and cardiovascular disease is monitored via collection of physical measurements such as blood pressure and body mass index). These survey results will inform public education and chronic disease prevention efforts. Emergency preparedness is also an essential component of public health organizations. Teams must be available and prepared to combat natural disasters, severe weather, outbreaks, <a href=\"/wiki/Bioterrorism\" title=\"Bioterrorism\">bioterrorism</a>, mass casualties and chemical emergencies.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Inform.2C_educate.2C_and_empower_people_about_health_issues\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Inform,_educate,_and_empower_people_about_health_issues\">Inform, educate, and empower people about health issues</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=10_Essential_Public_Health_Services&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: Inform, educate, and empower people about health issues\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Once public health priorities have been established through monitoring and investigation of health problems in the community, educational activities that promote improved health should be disseminated. Components in this service include: both the availability of health information and educational resources and the presence of health education and health promotion programs.<sup id=\"cite_ref-i_1-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-i-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> This can be achieved through media advocacy and social marketing. An example of this is the Eat Less, Weigh Less campaign executed by the <a href=\"/wiki/Los_Angeles_County_Department_of_Public_Health\" title=\"Los Angeles County Department of Public Health\">Los Angeles County Department of Public Health</a> that aims to increase awareness about appropriate portion sizes using advertisements on buses, billboards and social media.<sup id=\"cite_ref-x_10-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-x-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> It is also essential to establish health education and health promotion program partnerships with organizations in the community, such as schools, churches and employment facilities.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Mobilize_community_partnerships_to_identify_and_solve_health_problems\">Mobilize community partnerships to identify and solve health problems</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=10_Essential_Public_Health_Services&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10\" title=\"Edit section: Mobilize community partnerships to identify and solve health problems\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Public health organizations on the local, state and national level can mobilize community partnerships to identify and solve health problems. Components of this service include: building coalitions to utilize the full range of available resources; convening and facilitating partnerships that will undertake defined health improvement projects; and provide assistance to partners and communities to solve health problems.<sup id=\"cite_ref-i_1-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-i-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> Of particular importance is identification of potential stakeholders who will contribute to or benefit from public health activities. <a href=\"/wiki/First_5_LA\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"First 5 LA\">First 5 LA</a> is a community partner who supports targeted programs that address the needs of Los Angeles County children ages zero to five and their families.<sup id=\"cite_ref-xi_11-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-xi-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> They work closely with the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health to improve the physical and emotional health of this population. It is important to note that many of these stakeholders may not be considered to be health-related at first glance. For example, organizations involved in urban planning may be influential in improving the health of its residents. This could include increasing the walkability of a community or the number of parks or bike trails in a neighborhood.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Develop_policies_and_plans_that_support_individual_and_community_health_efforts\">Develop policies and plans that support individual and community health efforts</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=10_Essential_Public_Health_Services&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11\" title=\"Edit section: Develop policies and plans that support individual and community health efforts\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Policies can be effective in modifying human behavior and reducing negative health outcomes. Components in this service include: development of policy to guide the practice of public health; alignment of resources and strategies for community health efforts; and systematic health planning strategies to guide community health improvement.<sup id=\"cite_ref-i_1-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-i-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> In response to increasing rates of obesity and cardiovascular disease, the New York City Board of Health passed a ban on the sale of sodas and other sugary drinks larger than 16&#160;ounces at restaurants, street carts and movie theaters.<sup id=\"cite_ref-xii_12-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-xii-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> In addition to policies that can support health efforts, laws can reduce negative health outcomes. For example, dram shop liability is a law that holds the owner or server at a bar or restaurant where a patron consumed their last alcoholic beverage responsible for injuries or deaths caused as a result of alcohol-related incidents. A systematic review completed by the Task Force on Community Preventive Services, found strong evidence of the effectiveness of this law in reducing alcohol-related harms.<sup id=\"cite_ref-xiii_13-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-xiii-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Enforce_laws_and_regulations_that_protect_and_ensure_public_health_and_safety\">Enforce laws and regulations that protect and ensure public health and safety</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=10_Essential_Public_Health_Services&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12\" title=\"Edit section: Enforce laws and regulations that protect and ensure public health and safety\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>It is important that individuals and organizations comply with existing laws and regulations in order to ensure the overall health and safety of the general public. Components of this service include: reviewing, evaluating, and revising laws and regulations put in place to protect the health and safety of the public; educating persons and organizations about these laws and regulations to improve compliance and encourage enforcement of them; and enforcing actions that protect the health of the public (e.g., protection of drinking water; enforcement of clean air standards; enforcement of laws prohibiting the sale of alcoholic and tobacco products to minors, of laws concerning the use of seat belts and child safety seats; mandating childhood immunizations; facilitating timely follow-ups in the event of hazards and outbreaks of exposure-related diseases; monitoring quality of health services; conducting the timely review of new drugs, biologics, and medical devices; ensuring food safety; and enforcing housing and sanitation codes).<sup id=\"cite_ref-i_1-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-i-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Link_people_to_needed_personal_health_services_and_assure_the_provision_of_health_care_when_otherwise_unavailable\">Link people to needed personal health services and assure the provision of health care when otherwise unavailable</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=10_Essential_Public_Health_Services&amp;action=edit&amp;section=13\" title=\"Edit section: Link people to needed personal health services and assure the provision of health care when otherwise unavailable\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Having access to care when it is needed is important in helping individuals prevent and avoid unfavorable health outcomes and medical costs. At the local level, components of this service include: identifying populations that face barriers to accessing health services and addressing their personal health needs, assuring the linkage of these populations to appropriate health services by coordinating provider services, and developing and implementing interventions that address the barriers they face in attempting to access care. At the state and governance levels, components of this service include: assessing access to and availability of state health services; partnering with public, private, and non-profit sectors to provide a coordinated system of health care; assuring access to this coordinated health care system by using outreach efforts that link individuals to the health services they need; developing and implementing a continuous improvement process to assure the equitable distribution of resources for those in greatest need of these services.<sup id=\"cite_ref-i_1-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-i-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> The National HIV/AIDS Strategy (NHAS) employs this service idea as one of the action steps for achieving increased access to care and improved health outcomes for people living with HIV.<sup id=\"cite_ref-xiv_14-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-xiv-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Assure_a_competent_public_and_personal_health_care_workforce\">Assure a competent public and personal health care workforce</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=10_Essential_Public_Health_Services&amp;action=edit&amp;section=14\" title=\"Edit section: Assure a competent public and personal health care workforce\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Health care workers and staff who are competent (i.e., skilled in the core principles of public health practice) are more likely to provide care and other services more effectively and efficiently compared to those who are not.
