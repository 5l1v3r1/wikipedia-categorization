In the <a href=\"/wiki/United_Kingdom\" title=\"United Kingdom\">United Kingdom</a> in the 1930s, the majority of births occurred in the home.\n</p><p>The first organised obstetric flying squad was started by H. J. Thomson in <a href=\"/wiki/Bellshill\" title=\"Bellshill\">Bellshill</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Lanarkshire\" title=\"Lanarkshire\">Lanarkshire</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Scotland\" title=\"Scotland\">Scotland</a> in 1933 to provide emergency back-up to <a href=\"/wiki/General_practitioner\" title=\"General practitioner\">general practitioners</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Midwives\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Midwives\">midwives</a> involved in <a href=\"/wiki/Home_birth\" title=\"Home birth\">home births</a>.\n</p><p>The commonest major problems dealt with by the squad were:\n</p>\n<ul><li>major <a href=\"/wiki/Obstetrical_hemorrhage\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Obstetrical hemorrhage\">post-partum haemorrhage</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Retained_placenta\" title=\"Retained placenta\">retained placenta</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Obstructed_labour\" title=\"Obstructed labour\">obstructed labour</a></li></ul>\n<p>The mothers were frequently severely shocked and the baby was also likely to be in a precarious position. Many lives were saved during the early years of operation of the service. Other countries with high home-birth rates subsequently copied the idea and set up similar services.\n</p><p>In most <a href=\"/wiki/Developed_countries\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Developed countries\">developed countries</a> the majority of births now occur in hospitals and the <a href=\"/wiki/Ambulance\" title=\"Ambulance\">ambulance</a> services are well-developed, so the need for the service is extremely low. Less than 1% of births in the UK now occur in the home. The priority now is for rapid transport of distressed mothers to a hospital.\n</p><p>The original aim was to primarily manage obstetric complications on site, then secondarily transport the mother and child to hospital. This gradually evolved into primary on-site resuscitation than rapid transport to definitive care in a hospital. The concept of a hospital medical team going to retrieve patients continues in the concept of trauma retrieval teams.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Team_composition_and_equipment\">Team composition and equipment</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Obstetric_Flying_Squad&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Team composition and equipment\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The flying squad typically consisted of an <a href=\"/wiki/Obstetrician\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Obstetrician\">obstetrician</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Anaesthetist\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Anaesthetist\">anaesthetist</a>, midwife, and a helper such as a hospital orderly. The service was activated following a phone call for assistance, and the team members would 'fly' (meaning 'travel quickly') to the scene.\n</p><p>The anaesthetic equipment initially was quite simple and consisted of a <a href=\"/wiki/Schimmelbusch_mask\" title=\"Schimmelbusch mask\">Schimmelbusch mask</a> to administer <a href=\"/wiki/Chloroform\" title=\"Chloroform\">chloroform</a>. Later more sophisticated equipment was used. Of great importance was intravenous infusion equipment, intravenous fluids and later the provision of group O blood.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Obstetric_Flying_Squad&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li>Liang DYS.
