Stenger test is a test of hearing, primarily used to confirm non-organic hearing loss. It is also used to detect subjects who falsely claim to have hearing loss in one ear.  The test is based on Stenger principle.  The principle states that, if a tone of two intensities (one greater than the other) is delivered to two ears of a person simultaneously, the ear which receives the tone of the higher intensity alone hears it.  The test can be done using tuning forks in the clinical setting. The individual is blindfolded before the test starts. Two tuning forks of the same frequency are stricken and kept at a distance of 25 cm from each ear. When asked, the individual will claim to hear it in the normal ear. Then, the tuning fork is brought as close as 8 cm near the feigned ear while maintaining the tuning fork at the normal side at the same distance. The individual will deny hearing anything if he/she is a malingerer. An individual with true deafness should continue to hear the sound on the normal side. Alternatively, this test can be performed more accurately using two-channel audiometer using pure tone signals.
