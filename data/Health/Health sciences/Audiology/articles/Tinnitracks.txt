Tinnitracks is a software for the treatment of tinnitus based on neuro acoustic modulation developed and marketed by Sonormed GmbH. It can be accessed by internet both via computer and via mobile devices and uses a multistage process to individually adapt regular music songs to the unique tinnitus frequency of each patient.  The concept behind this treatment has been developed and researched by the University of Muenster, Germany. Tinnitracks was developed based on this research and provides access to the treatment beyond academic research programs. It has received some awards   and won several start-up competitions, among them the SXSW Accelerator in the category “Digital Health & Life Sciences Technologies” at the 2015 South by Southwest Interactive Festival.   Patients suffering from tinnitus can use the Tinnitracks software to filter their individual tinnitus frequency from their music songs.  By processing a song, the defined frequency is extracted creating a gap called “notch” in the frequency-profile that covers the exact tinnitus frequency as well as about an octave around it. Afterwards, the software checks if the audio profile of the song meets the criteria for the tinnitus treatment.  Accuracy of frequency measurement is paramount in the process, which is why patients are required to visit ENT specialists or acousticians to create an accurate tinnitus audiogram.   Tinnitracks is based on the Tailor-Made Notched Music Training  (TMNMT) ). This approach uses filtered music to reduce the tinnitus loudness. The name TMNMT already stresses the importance of individualization in the whole set-up and refers both to the patient’s individual tinnitus frequency and the use of the patient’s favourite music. By filtering the tinnitus frequency from the music the frequency profile of a song is changed affecting the reactions induced in certain areas of the auditory cortex. Those cortical areas correlated to the frequency that got filtered are no longer stimulated.
