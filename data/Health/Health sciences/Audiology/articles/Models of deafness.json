Deafness is therefore conceptualized from a \"personal tragedy\" stance, with implicit questions naturally arising such as:  \"By what criteria and by whom is the impairment construed as an infirmity; how did the infirmity arise; what are the risks and benefits of the available treatment, if any; what can be done to minimize the disabling effects of the infirmity?\"\n</p><p>Medical ethics and law dictate that it is up to the patient (or the patient's legal representative) to decide the treatments he or she wishes. For this very reason, the question as to whether deafness is physical impairment or personal tragedy to be overcome is secondary to medical doctors and health professions. Similarly, doctors and scientists who engage in research are doing so simply because there is demand for information and for techniques which can restore hearing.\n</p><p>The view that deafness is a \"<a href=\"/wiki/Disability\" title=\"Disability\">disability</a>\" has economic consequences in political environments concerned with <a href=\"/wiki/Social_welfare\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Social welfare\">social welfare</a>.

In better-designed environments, they are disabled less, or not at all. This affirmation arises in part from the understanding that while medical intervention can improve the health issues inherent in certain forms of disability, it does not address societal issues that prevail regardless of the extent or success of medical intervention.  In conjunction with this view of changing the environment from a disabling to an enabling atmosphere, advocates of the social model persevere in the de-institutionalization of disabled persons by encouraging maximum integration with non-disabled peers, especially, but not exclusively, in the school environment.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Cultural_model\">Cultural model</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Models_of_deafness&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Cultural model\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Further information: <a href=\"/wiki/Deaf_culture\" title=\"Deaf culture\">Deaf culture</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Deafhood\" title=\"Deafhood\">Deafhood</a></div>\n<p>The cultural model of deafness arises from, but is not limited to, deaf people themselves, especially congenitally deaf people whose primary language is the <a href=\"/wiki/Sign_language\" title=\"Sign language\">sign language</a> of their nation or community, as well as their children, families, friends and other members of their social networks.

This cultural model of deafness represents the natural evolution of the social networks of a minority language group.  In this view the conceptualization of deafness is seen from a \"community asset\" stance.

Both hearing and deaf parents understand that it is easier for a hearing parent to raise a hearing child because of their intimate understanding of the hearing state of being. It follows that a deaf parent will have an easier experiences raising a deaf child since deaf parents have an intimate understanding of the deaf state of being.

Thus membership is not seen as the act of admittance by an insider group or even by anyone at all, but by examining individual behavior to determine how closely it resembles the known culturally determined behaviors found in the community of deaf people. Since sign language stands as the single most valued aspect of deaf culture, it reveals whether an individual belongs to this <a href=\"/wiki/Minority_language\" title=\"Minority language\">language minority</a> in the same manner as embracing the Spanish language reveals identity with <a href=\"/wiki/Hispanics_in_the_United_States\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hispanics in the United States\">Hispanic-American culture</a>, another example of a language minority.  Groups disadvantaged by majority culture and practices, such as the deaf community, have commonalities with other groups.  For example, people with disabilities, gay people, and women are not linguistic minorities, as are members of the deaf community, since their culturally determined behaviors do not center on a unifying language as in the communities of Hispanic-Americans and Native-Americans.  Gay culture and American deaf culture, both of which experience the disadvantages of being minority cultures, bear resemblance to one another in that most members of these two minority groups do not share their minority identity with their parents and cannot develop it at home. However, gay culture does not rally around a unifying language as is seen with a minority language group like the community of deaf people.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Cultural_deafness_and_the_social_model\">Cultural deafness and the social model</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Models_of_deafness&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Cultural deafness and the social model\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<table class=\"plainlinks metadata ambox ambox-content ambox-Unreferenced\" role=\"presentation\"><tbody><tr><td class=\"mbox-image\"><div style=\"width:52px\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png\" width=\"50\" height=\"39\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/75px-Question_book-new.svg.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/100px-Question_book-new.svg.png 2x\" data-file-width=\"512\" data-file-height=\"399\" /></a></div></td><td class=\"mbox-text\"><div class=\"mbox-text-span\">This section <b>does not <a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citing sources\">cite</a> any <a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability\" title=\"Wikipedia:Verifiability\">sources</a></b>.<span class=\"hide-when-compact\"> Please help <a class=\"external text\" href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Models_of_deafness&amp;action=edit\">improve this section</a> by <a href=\"/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing_with_Wiki_Markup/1\" title=\"Help:Introduction to referencing with Wiki Markup/1\">adding citations to reliable sources</a>.
