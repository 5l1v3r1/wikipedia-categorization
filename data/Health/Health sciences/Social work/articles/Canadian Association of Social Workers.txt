The Canadian Association of Social Workers (CASW) is the national association for the social work profession in Canada.   CASW was founded in 1926  to establish standards of practice for social workers.  It has individual members, and 10 provincial and territorial partner organizations. Its mission objective is to promote positive social services, protect the professionals of social work from mistreatment in Canada, satiate social needs of Canadians by influencing policies and advancing social justice.  It is a member of the International Federation of Social Workers (IFSW), and evaluates the credentials of foreign-trained social workers.  It makes policies and offers advice, decides ethics,   and provides services to social workers.   CASW provides benefits and advantages associated with a professional organization for its members, such as insurance packages that include professional liability insurance, group life, disability, and a retirement plan. The CASW's Code of Ethics, last updated in 2005, together with its Guidelines for Ethical Practice, serve as the benchmark for ethical social work practice in Canada.  Non-registered and registration-inclined social workers who have completed a social work degree use LSW or LMSW, the licensed social worker designation is a common designation for career generalists and licensed master's social worker to those entering the profession with a postgraduate degree. CASW has 9 provincial and territorial partners in Canada, representing all provinces and territories with the exception of Ontario and Qu√©bec.  Affiliate memberships are offered to Social Workers in provinces not represented by a partner organization.
