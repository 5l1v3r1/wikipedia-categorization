Casey Family Programs is a national operating foundation  focused on foster care and child welfare.   Based in Seattle, Washington, Casey Family Programs works in 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. They have offices in Arizona, California, Colorado, the District of Columbia, Georgia, Idaho, New York, Texas and Washington.  The foundation, established by United Parcel Service founder James E. Casey in 1966, has a stated mission "to provide and improve—and ultimately prevent the need for—foster care" in the United States.  Casey Family Programs works primarily in three areas: Casey Family Programs has developed a number of tools used by child welfare agencies, including the Ansell Casey Life Skills Assessment.  In 1966, the Casey family philanthropy, acting through their Annie E. Casey Foundation (AECF), started a child welfare agency (foster care and related services) in the Seattle, Washington area.  When Jim Casey's company, United Parcel Service (UPS), moved its headquarters from Seattle to New York City in 1973, Jim Casey gave the Seattle child welfare agency enough funds to become officially a separate, independent entity from the AECF.  That organization is known today as "Casey Family Programs."     Casey Family Programs evolved over time — broadening its role from traditional foster care to "reach more children and have more of a national impact."  By 2015, Casey Family Programs claimed to be working in "50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico."  In 1976, Jim Casey started similar programs on the east coast, creating Casey Family Services, based in Connecticut and serving the New England states until 2012.  In 2001, Casey Family Programs founded the Marguerite Casey Foundation to help low-income families. Casey Family Programs is also the founding member of Foster Care Alumni of America.
