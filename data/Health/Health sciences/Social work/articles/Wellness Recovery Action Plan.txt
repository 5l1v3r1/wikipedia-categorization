Wellness Recovery Action Plan (WRAP) is a recovery model developed by a group of people in northern Vermont in 1997 in a workshop on mental health recovery led by Mary Ellen Copeland. It has been extensively studied and is now an evidence-based practice, listed in the SAMSHA National Registry of Evidence-Based Programs and Practices (NREPP).  WRAP focuses on a person's strengths, rather than perceived deficits.  WRAP is voluntary and trauma informed. People develop their own WRAP.
