The Waterlow score (or  Waterlow scale) gives an estimated risk for the development of a pressure sore in a given patient. The tool was developed in 1985 by clinical nurse teacher Judy Waterlow. The following areas are assessed for each patient and assigned a point value. Additional points in special risk categories are assigned to selected patients. Potential scores range from 1 to 64.  A total Waterlow score ≥10 indicates risk for pressure ulcer. A high risk score is ≥15. A very high risk exists at scores ≥20. The reverse side of the Waterlow score lists examples of preventive aids and interventions.  While packaged conveniently as a laminated card, the score has received criticism owing to its large number of scored items. This, combined with a lack of operational definitions, may reduce its reliability.
