All of Us (previously known as the Precision Medicine Initiative) is a research project created in 2015 during the tenure of Barack Obama with $215 million in funding that aimed to make advances in tailoring medical care to the individual.  The project aimed to collect genetic and health data from one million subjects.  The initiative was announced during the 2015 State of the Union Address,  was run by the National Institutes of Health and was advised by Verily Life Sciences.  Congress has authorized $1.45 billion for the project.  In October 2016, the project was renamed "All of Us".    By January 2018 an initial pilot project had enrolled about 10,000 people and 2022 was targeted for one million people.   Professor Kenneth Weiss from Pennsylvania State University, in a skeptical review of this project in 2017, suggested that the funding could be better spent elsewhere.
