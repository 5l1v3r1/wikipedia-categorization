Molecular Koch's postulates are a set of experimental criteria that must be satisfied to show that a gene found in a pathogenic microorganism encodes a product that contributes to the disease caused by the pathogen.  Genes that satisfy molecular Koch's postulates are often referred to as virulence factors.  The postulates were formulated by the microbiologist Stanley Falkow in 1988 and are based on Koch's postulates.  The postulates as originally described by Dr. Falkow are as follows: For many pathogenic microorganisms, it is not currently possible to apply molecular Koch's postulates to a gene in question.  Testing a candidate virulence gene requires a relevant animal model of the disease being examined and the ability to genetically manipulate the microorganism that causes the disease.  Suitable animal models are lacking for many important human diseases.  Additionally, many pathogens cannot be manipulated genetically.
