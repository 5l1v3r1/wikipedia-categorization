In epidemiology, the next-generation matrix is a method used to derive the basic reproduction number, for a compartmental model of the spread of infectious diseases. This method is given by Diekmann et al. (1990)  and van den Driessche and Watmough (2002).  To calculate the basic reproduction number by using a next-generation matrix, the whole population is divided into                         n                 {\displaystyle n}     compartments in which there are                         m         <         n                 {\displaystyle m<n}     infected compartments. Let                                    x                        i                             ,         i         =         1         ,         2         ,         3         ,         …         ,         m                 {\displaystyle x_{i},i=1,2,3,\ldots ,m}     be the numbers of infected individuals in the                                    i                        t             h                                     {\displaystyle i^{th}}     infected compartment at time t. Now, the epidemic model is In the above equations,                                    F                        i                             (         x         )                 {\displaystyle F_{i}(x)}     represents the rate of appearance of new infections in compartment                         i                 {\displaystyle i}    .                                     V                        i                                   +                                     {\displaystyle V_{i}^{+}}     represents the rate of transfer of individuals into compartment                         i                 {\displaystyle i}     by all other means, and                                    V                        i                                   −                             (         x         )                 {\displaystyle V_{i}^{-}(x)}     represents the rate of transfer of individuals out of compartment                         i                 {\displaystyle i}    . The above model can also be written as where and Let                                    x                        0                                     {\displaystyle x_{0}}     be the disease-free equilibrium. The values of the Jacobian matrices                         F         (         x         )                 {\displaystyle F(x)}     and                         V         (         x         )                 {\displaystyle V(x)}     are: and respectively. Here,                         F                 {\displaystyle F}     and                         V                 {\displaystyle V}     are m × m  matrices, defined as                         F         =                                                ∂                                F                                    i                                                                         ∂                                x                                    j                                                                          (                    x                        0                             )                 {\displaystyle F={\frac {\partial F_{i}}{\partial x_{j}}}(x_{0})}     and                         V         =                                                ∂                                V                                    i                                                                         ∂                                x                                    j                                                                          (                    x                        0                             )                 {\displaystyle V={\frac {\partial V_{i}}{\partial x_{j}}}(x_{0})}    . Now, the matrix                         F                    V                        −             1                                     {\displaystyle FV^{-1}}     is known as the next-generation matrix. The largest eigenvalue or spectral radius of                         F                    V                        −             1                                     {\displaystyle FV^{-1}}     is the basic reproduction number of the model.
