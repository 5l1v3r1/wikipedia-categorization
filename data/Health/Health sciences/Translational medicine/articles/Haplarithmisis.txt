Haplarithmisis (Greek for haplotype numbering) is a conceptual process in Genetics that enables simultaneous haplotyping and copy-number profiling of DNA samples derived from cells. Haplarithmisis also reveals parental, segregation, and mechanistic origins of genomic anomalies.   The resulting profiles of haplarithmisis are called parental haplarithms (i.e. paternal haplarithm and maternal haplarithm). Haplarithmisis enabled a new form of preimplantation genetic diagnosis, such that not only segmental and full chromosome anomalies could be detected but also it allowed tracing back of these anomalies to meiosis and mitosis.   In its first application in basic genome research, haplarithmisis led to discovery of parental genome segregation, a phenomenon that causes the segregation of entire parental genomes in distinct blastomere lineages causing cleavage-stage chimerism and mixoploidy.
