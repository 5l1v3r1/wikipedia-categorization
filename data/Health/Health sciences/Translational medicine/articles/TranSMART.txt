 tranSMART is an open source data warehouse designed to store large amounts of clinical data from clinical trials, as well as data from basic research, so that it can be interrogated together for translational research. It is also designed to be used by many people, across organizations. It was developed by Johnson & Johnson, in partnership with Recombinant Data Corporation. The platform was released in Jan 2012 and has been governed by the tranSMART Foundation since its initiation in 2013. The tranSMART platform has been adopted and evaluated by numerous pharmaceutical companies, not-for-profits and patient advocacy groups, academics, governmental organisations and service providers.   At the Bio-IT World industry conference both the Innovative Medicines Initiative's U-BIOPRED project and The Michael J. Fox Foundation were awarded a Best Practices Award for their application of the platform.   tranSMART is built on top of the i2b2 clinical data warehouse and leverages the i2b2 star schema for modelling clinical and low-dimensional data.  High-dimensional omics data is stored in dedicated tables where each of the data types (e.g., gene expression, SNP or metabolomics) retains its specific data structure. Both the Oracle and PostgreSQL database management systems are supported for its data storage.
