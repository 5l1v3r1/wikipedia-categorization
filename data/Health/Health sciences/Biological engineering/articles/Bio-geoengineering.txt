Bio-geoengineering is a form of climate engineering which seeks to use or modify plants or other living things to modify the Earth's climate.   Bio-energy with carbon storage, afforestation projects, and ocean nourishment (including iron fertilization) could be considered examples of bio-geoengineering.  Biogenic aerosols can be grown to replace those beneficial aerosols lost as the result of the death of 50% of Earth's boreal forests. Agricultural production of atmospheric aerosols called "monoterpenes" is possible if crops that are rich in monoterpenes are grown.
