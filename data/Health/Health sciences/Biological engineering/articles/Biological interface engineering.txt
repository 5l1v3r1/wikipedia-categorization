Biological interface engineering is a branch of bioengineering (specifically a subset of tissue and biological materials engineering) dedicated to the study of biological response to materials and material response to biologicals. Most applications of biological interface engineering are related (but not limited to) material, structural and geometric configurations of: vasculature devices, orthopedic devices, neurological devices and organ replacement devices. Biological interface engineering involves the marriage of analytical, organic and physical chemistry with genetic, cellular and whole body system biological sciences. Further, biological interface engineering uses concepts developed in traditional materials engineering to describe phenomena observed at the interface of a biological device and a living organism.
