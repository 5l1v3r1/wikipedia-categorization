Gibson assembly® is a molecular cloning method which allows for the joining of multiple DNA fragments in a single, isothermal reaction. It was created by Daniel G. Gibson, Vice President of DNA Technology at Synthetic Genomics Inc (SGI), in collaboration with the J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI).  The entire Gibson assembly reaction requires few components with minor manipulations.   The method can simultaneously combine up to 15 DNA fragments based on sequence identity. It requires that the DNA fragments contain ~20-40 base pair overlap with adjacent DNA fragments. These DNA fragments are mixed with a cocktail of three enzymes, along with other buffer components. The three required enzyme activities are: exonuclease, DNA polymerase, and DNA ligase. The resulting product is different DNA fragments joined into one. Either linear or closed circular molecules can be assembled. There are two approaches to Gibson Assembly. A one-step method and a two-step method. Both methods can be performed in a single reaction vessel. The Gibson Assembly 1-Step method allows for the assembly of up to 5 different fragments using a single step isothermal process.  In this method, fragments and a master mix of enzymes is combined and the entire mixture is incubated at 50 °C for up to one hour. For the creation of more complex constructs with up to 15 fragments, or for constructs incorporating fragments from 100 bp to 10 kb, the Gibson Assembly two-step approach is used. The two-step reaction requires two separate additions of master mix; one for the exonuclease and  annealing step and second for the DNA polymerase and ligation steps. For the two-step approach, different incubation temperatures are used to carry out the assembly process. This DNA assembly method has many advantages compared to conventional restriction enzyme/ligation cloning of recombinant DNA.
