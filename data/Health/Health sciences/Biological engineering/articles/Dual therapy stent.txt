A dual therapy stent is a coronary artery stent that combines the technology of a bioengineered stent and a drug eluting stent to both accelerate healing of the vessel and to block cell proliferation.   One version combines the Genous endothelial progenitor cell capture technology with an antiproliferative, biodegradable sirolimus drug elution.  The Combo Stent has received CE Mark approval.
