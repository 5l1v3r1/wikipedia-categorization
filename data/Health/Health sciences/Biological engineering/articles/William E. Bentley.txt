William E. Bentley is the Robert E. Fischell Distinguished Professor of Engineering and founding Director of the Fischell Institute for Biomedical Devices located in the A. James Clark School of Engineering at the University of Maryland. He was previously the Chair of the Fischell Department of Bioengineering,  where he assisted in establishing the department and provided leadership that led to its nationally ranked status.  Dr. Bentley is also appointed in the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering  at the University of Maryland, College Park and the Institute for Bioscience and Biotechnology Research.  He has served on advisory committees and panels for the NIH, NSF, DOD, DOE, USDA, and several state agencies. He has mentored over 25 Ph.D.s, some of whom are academics at: Cornell University (x2), University of Colorado, Clemson University, University of Connecticut, Tufts University, Postech (Korea), and National Tsing Hua University (Taiwan). Dr. Bentley received his undergraduate (BS, '82) and Master of Engineering degrees ('83) from Cornell University and his Ph.D. ('89) from the University of Colorado, Boulder, all in chemical engineering.  Dr. Bentley worked for the International Paper Company, on alternative fuels and recovery process improvement.  At Maryland since 1989, Dr. Bentley has focused his research on the development of molecular tools that facilitate the expression of biologically active proteins, having authored over 200 related archival publications. Recent interests are on deciphering and manipulating signal transduction pathways, including those of bacterial communication networks, for altering cell phenotype. He was an integral component in the creation of the Bioprocess Scale-Up Facility (BSF) at the University of Maryland. While associated with the BSF, the facility performed contract research projects for MedImmune (Synagis) and Martek (Life's DHA)
