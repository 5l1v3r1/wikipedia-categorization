An academic health science centre (AHSC; also known as an academic health sciences centre, an academic health science(s) system, an academic health science(s) partnership or an academic medical centre) is a partnership between two or more universities and healthcare providers focusing on research, clinical services, education and training.  AHSCs are intended to ensure that medical research breakthroughs lead to direct clinical benefits for patients.  The organisational structures that comprise an AHSC can take a variety of forms, ranging from simple partnerships to, less frequently, fully integrated organisations with a single management board.  There are AHSCs operating in a number of countries including Australia, Canada, the Republic of Ireland, Japan, the Netherlands, Qatar, Singapore, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States.

When contracts were signed with NHS in 2013, AHSCs shared among themselves around Â£60 million of funding. With a clear purpose, structure and approach of individual AHSCs is a matter for local decision especially with the contrasting approaches adopted as well as the differences in opinions voiced out by network founders.  The following AHSCs are currently in operation in the UK:    AHSCs currently in operation in the United States include: AHSCs currently in operation in other parts of the world include:
