 Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust is an NHS trust based in London, United Kingdom. It is one of the largest NHS trusts in England  and together with Imperial College London forms an academic health science centre. The trust was formed in October 2007 by the merger of Hammersmith Hospitals NHS Trust and St Mary's NHS Trust and their integration with Imperial College Faculty of Medicine. It currently manages five hospitals: Charing Cross Hospital; Hammersmith Hospital; Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital; St Mary's Hospital and Western Eye Hospital. In 2012/13 Imperial College Healthcare had a turnover of £971.3 million, employed approximately 9,770 people and treated almost 1.2 million patients.  In July 2014 it was revealed that the Trust was intending to sell  more than half of Charing Cross hospital, 45% of St Mary’s and the whole of the  Western Eye Hospital to raise around 40 per cent of its redevelopment costs.  Charing Cross will be replaced with a £150m “local hospital” development offering planned care on an outpatient or day case basis.  Imperial College Healthcare was formed on 1 October 2007 by the merger of Hammersmith Hospitals NHS Trust and St Mary's NHS Trust with Imperial College London Faculty of Medicine.  In July 2008 Imperial College Healthcare announced that it would be launching a pilot scheme to reward medical teams with bonuses for successful operations.   In January 2009 the results of a study were published in which researchers had successfully captured MRI images of bleeding inside the hearts of 15 Imperial College Healthcare patients who had suffered a heart attack.  In November 2009 a team led by Professor Paul Abel of Imperial College Healthcare performed the first removal of a rectal cancer using ultrasound.  In April 2011 it was reported that Imperial College Healthcare had an underlying financial deficit and faced a potential gap of £40 million between income and expenditure in 2011/12.  In 2012/13 Imperial College Healthcare Trust achieved a year-end adjusted surplus of £9.0 million.  The Trust's interim chief executive is Professor Julian Redhead . The chair of the Trust was Lord Tugendhat from its inception in October 2007 until December 2011 when he was succeeded by Sir Richard Sykes. The clinical services of Imperial College Healthcare are organised into four divisions:  In 2012/13 it achieved a year end adjusted surplus of £9.0 million with a total income of £971.30 million, of which £752.725 million was from patient care activities and £218.549 million was from other operating revenue.  In the same year it had operating expenses of £939.70 million, capital expenditure of £25.0 million.  As at 31 March 2013 it had total assets of £855.737 million, total assets less current liabilities of £687.395 million and total assets employed of £664.033 million.  It ended 2015/6 in deficit of £47.9 million.   This was partly as a result of changes to the NHS tariff.   It reported that vacancies had reached 1/6 of the nursing workforce in July 2015.   In 2017/8 it predicted a deficit of £25.1 million and did not predict a full-year surplus until 2021-22.  The total backlog maintenance bill had risen to £1.3 billion, the largest in the English NHS, and the trust had requested £131 million from NHS Improvement “to mitigate high and significant risk items”.   The trust has opened a clinic in Dubai. It is one of the most commercial NHS trusts, increasing private income, mostly from general and maternity care, by 19% from 2014 to 2016.  About 25% of patients using private services came from overseas.  During 2012/13 the trust employed an average of 9,770 people:  It was named by the Health Service Journal as one of the top hundred NHS trusts to work for in 2015.  At that time it had 8919 full-time equivalent staff and a sickness absence rate of 3.06%. 71% of staff recommend it as a place for treatment and 62% recommended it as a place to work.  It was one of the first trusts to introduce a comprehensive public Wi-Fi service, in 2015. The basic service is free for patients, visitors and staff.  There is also a premium service which enables video and audio streaming.  It has a contract with DHL Supply Chain for non-emergency patient transport services which cost £12.1 million in 2015-16.

It is also part of one of eleven National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centres.   The trust has one of the 11 Genomics Medicines Centres associated with Genomics England which will open across England in February 2014. All the data produced in the 100,000 Genomes project will be made available to drugs companies and researchers to help them create precision drugs for future generations.  In 2016 it set up a project with DeepMind to develop new clinical mobile apps linked to electronic patient records.  The trust was one of 26 responsible for half of the national growth in patients waiting more than four hours in accident and emergency over the 2014/5 winter.
