The Radboud University Medical Center (Dutch: Radboudumc), is the teaching hospital affiliated with the Radboud University Nijmegen, in the city of Nijmegen in the eastern-central part of the Netherlands. The Radboud University Medical Center was founded in 1956. It changed its name to UMC St Radboud and transformed to a complete new organization in 1999 by a merger of the Academisch Ziekenhuis Nijmegen (AZN) (Academic Hospital of Nijmegen) and the medical faculty of the Katholieke Universiteit Nijmegen (Catholic University of Nijmegen), now the Radboud University Nijmegen. Thus, it is a semi-independent medical university and hospital, which is not directly linked to the Radboud University. In 2013 the hospital changed its name to Radboudumc in Dutch and Radboud University Medical Center in English.
