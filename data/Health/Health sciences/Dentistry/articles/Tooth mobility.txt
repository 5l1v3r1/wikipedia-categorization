Tooth mobility is the medical term for loose teeth. Mobility is graded clinically by applying pressure with the ends of 2 metal instruments (e.g. dental mirrors) and trying to rock a tooth gently in a bucco-lingual direction (towards the tongue and outwards again). Using the fingers is not reliable as they are too compressible and will not detect small increases in movement. :184 The location of the fulcrum may be of interest in dental trauma. Teeth which are mobile about a fulcrum half way along their root likely have a fractured root. :184 Normal, physiologic tooth mobility of about 0.25Â mm is present in health. This is because the tooth is not fused to the bones of the jaws, but is connected to the sockets by the periodontal ligament. This slight mobility is to accommodate forces on the teeth during chewing without damaging them. :55 Milk (deciduous) teeth also become looser naturally just before their exfoliation. :197 This is caused by gradual resorption of their roots, stimulated by the developing permanent tooth underneath. Abnormal, pathologic tooth mobility occurs when the attachment of the periodontal ligament to the tooth is reduced (attachment loss, see diagram), or if the periodontal ligament is inflamed. :220 Generally, the degree of mobility is inversely related to the amount of bone and periodontal ligament support left.
