A nickel titanium (NiTi) rotary file is an engine-driven tapered and pointed endodontic instrument made of nickel titanium alloy with cutting edges used to mechanically shape and prepare the root canals during endodontic therapy or to remove the root canal obturating material while performing retreatment. The first NiTi file was introduced to the market in 1991. Superelasticity and shape memory are the properties that make Niti files very flexible. The high flexibility of Niti files makes them superior to stainless steel files for the purpose of rotary root canal preparation. The use of NiTi rotary files in dentistry is a common practice. The main components of a rotary NiTi file are tip size, taper, flutes, helix angle and measuring stop. There can be other features such as redial lands and measuring lines incorporated in some designs. Separation of Niti rotary files happens due to torsional failure, cyclic fatigue or the combination of both in clinical practice.  It has been found that the decision to discard a rotary file after being used with regard to prevention of file separation is dependent on operator's skills and judgment.
