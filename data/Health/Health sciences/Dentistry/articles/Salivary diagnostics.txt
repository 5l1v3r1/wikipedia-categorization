Salivary diagnostics or Salivaomics is a procedure for testing and maintaining the data for diagnostic purposes.  Saliva based hand-held sensors are used to detect and measure proteins and nucleic acids that are present in saliva for diagnosis.  Salivary diagnostic technology is showing promise in the detection and monitoring malignancies at early stage and other various health concerns . The advantages of salivary diagnostics includes ease of collection, elimination of fear of needles, inexpensive testing and reduce risk of disease transmission between healthcare workers and patients. In addition, salivary diagnostic is fast, highly sensitive and specific, portable, user-friendly and can screen for multiple agents simultaneously  contributing in determining the scope of toxin exposure, thereby providing a quicker fight and diagnosis in the event of pandemic, epidemic and bioterrorism .
