Johrei "purification of the spirit" (浄霊, Jōrei), sometimes spelled jyorei, is a form of alternative medicine similar to Reiki.  It was introduced in Japan in the 1930s by Mokichi Okada.     Despite presenting itself as a form of alternative medicine, the Johrei Fellowship maintains that it does not not prescribe, nor diagnose or treat physical illnesses  and that their focus is on spiritual health and world peace instead of physical health. [clarification needed] Okada, who was also a previous member of Omoto, one of Japan's new religions, claimed to have a vision in 1925 of the Buddhist Bodhisattva Kannon (Kuan Yin) and she gave him the divine light, along with a command that Okada proclaim himself a prophet.  He later established the Great Japan Association for the Veneration of the Bodhisattva Kanon, with divine healing as its main purpose.  Practitioners claim to channel vitalist "energy" into patients by waving their hands over the patient's body.   There is a claim that, in lectures and classes, there are numerous reports of dramatic healings.  Aside from its association with these miracles, Johrei is known for its two significant features. The first involves simplicity of the healing practice because the placement of the hand over another person can be performed anywhere.  Egalitarianism constitutes the second feature of Johrei. This is based on the fundamental idea that one person administers healing and another receives it and that "there is no difference between clergy and followers in their ability to transmit the light of God."    Johrei was introduced to America in 1953, and there are numerous Johrei centers throughout the United States and other countries.
