Jesus' cleansing of ten lepers is one of the miracles of Jesus reported in the Gospels (Gospel of Luke 17:11-19).   According to Luke's account, on his way to Jerusalem, Jesus encountered ten lepers. He healed them, but only one returned to thank Jesus afterward. According to Berard Marthaler and Herbert Lockyer, this miracle emphasizes the importance of faith, for Jesus did not say: "My power has saved you" but attributed the healing to the faith of the beneficiaries.
