{"parse":{"title":"Ralstonism","pageid":782207,"revid":855353422,"text":{"*":"<div class=\"mw-parser-output\"><p><b>Ralstonism</b> was a <a href=\"/wiki/Social_movement\" title=\"Social movement\">social movement</a> in 19th century US. It claimed about 800,000 followers. Ralstonism was the brainchild of <a href=\"/wiki/Webster_Edgerly\" title=\"Webster Edgerly\">Webster Edgerly</a> (1852\u20131926). In Edgerly's words, \"Ralstonism is the grandest movement that man is capable of establishing\".\n</p><p>Ralstonism began as the Ralston Health Club, which published Edgerly's writings. It was a hierarchical organization where members were ranked according to the number of \"degrees\" they had, which ranged from 0 to 100. Members advanced five degrees at a time, and each Ralston book that a member purchased counted as five degrees.\n</p><p>Although Edgerly claimed in the 1900 edition of <i>The Book of General Membership of the Ralston Health Club</i> that the letters for the word RALSTON came from <b>R</b>egime, <b>A</b>ctivity, <b>L</b>ight, <b>S</b>trength, <b>T</b>emperation, <b>O</b>xygen and <b>N</b>ature, earlier editions of the same book are credited to <i>Everett Ralston</i>, a <a href=\"/wiki/Pseudonym\" title=\"Pseudonym\">pseudonym</a> of Edgerly, with the implication that Ralstonism is named after this fictitious person.\n</p><p>Edgerly saw his followers as the founding members of a new race, based on <a href=\"/wiki/Caucasian_race\" title=\"Caucasian race\">Caucasians</a>, and free from \"impurities\". He advocated the castration of all \"anti-racial\" (non-Caucasian) males at birth.\n</p><p>Edgerly wrote eighty-two of what would today be called <a href=\"/wiki/Self-help\" title=\"Self-help\">self-help</a> books under the pseudonym \"Edmund Shaftesbury\". They covered subjects like diet, exercise, punctuation, sexual magnetism, artistic deep breathing, facial expressions and <a href=\"/wiki/Ventriloquism\" title=\"Ventriloquism\">ventriloquism</a>. Although Edgerly publicly claimed that the Ralston Company had no goods for sale, he did sell his books through mail order. Many of these books are still available through old-books dealers.\n</p><p>In addition to advice like brushing your teeth, the books make various recommendations, for example that every young man should engage in a form of probationary marriage with a woman old enough to be his grandmother. Edgerly also created his own language, called the \"Adam-Man-Tongue\", with a 33-letter alphabet.\n</p><p><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=The_Magnetism_Club_of_America&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"The Magnetism Club of America (page does not exist)\">The Magnetism Club of America</a>, another Ralstonite organization, was founded to give its members control over the minds of others.\n</p><p>Ralstonites were to follow strict dietary guidelines. For example, watermelons were supposed to be poisonous to Caucasians. Correct diet and proper physical exercise would help readers attain \"<a href=\"/wiki/Personal_magnetism\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Personal magnetism\">personal magnetism</a>\", which would give them control over the thoughts of others. Much of the physical regime demanded moving in graceful curves and arcs and walking exclusively on the balls of one's feet. Because sudden starts and stops and sharp angular movements caused a \"leakage of vital force\", Ralstonites were to even pick marbles in continuous circles. There was a proper way to bathe (dry bath), gesture, sit, stand, sleep, talk and have sex. Edgerly claimed a scientific basis for all this.\n</p><p>In 1900 Edgerly joined forces with the founder of Purina Food Company, which took the name <i>Ralston Purina Company</i> (now <a href=\"/wiki/Nestl%C3%A9_Purina_PetCare\" title=\"Nestl\u00e9 Purina PetCare\">Nestl\u00e9 Purina PetCare</a>). It made whole-wheat cereal that Ralstonites were to consume. The food company Edgerly founded evolved into what is now called <a href=\"/wiki/Ralcorp\" title=\"Ralcorp\">Ralcorp</a>, and was the original owner of the cereal brands <a href=\"/wiki/Chex\" title=\"Chex\">Chex</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Cookie_Crisp\" title=\"Cookie Crisp\">Cookie Crisp</a>.\n</p><p>Between 1894 and 1895 Edgerly bought large areas of farmland along the northern slope of <a href=\"/wiki/Hopewell_Valley\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hopewell Valley\">Hopewell Valley</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/New_Jersey\" title=\"New Jersey\">New Jersey</a>. There Edgerly founded Ralston Heights in 1905, a house built to his own design to contain a community of Ralstonites he meant to be a core of a future City of Ralston. The contours of the estate followed Edgerly's conviction that sudden stops and walking in straight lines would cause leakage of vital force.\n</p><p>Edgerly planned to expand to hundreds of lots, sixteen small farms, seven palaces and a Temple of Ralston. This community did not materialize, at least not in the form Edgerly intended. Much of the estate still stands today, in ruined condition.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Ralstonism&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li>Janet Six - \"Hidden History of Ralston Heights\" (<i><a href=\"/wiki/Archaeology_(magazine)\" title=\"Archaeology (magazine)\">Archaeology</a></i> May/June 2004) <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://archive.archaeology.org/0405/abstracts/ralston.html\">abstract</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"External_links\">External links</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Ralstonism&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: External links\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.oddbooks.com/edgerly/review.html\">A Website About the Writings of Webster Edgerly</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://archive.org/details/lifebuildingmeth00ralsiala\"><i>Life building method of the Ralston Health Club; \"All nature\" course</i> at archive.org</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://archive.org/details/bookofgeneralmem00ralsrich\"><i>Book of general membership of the Ralston Health Club</i> at archive.org</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20110529215126/http://www.neurolinguistic.com/pnl/scannedebooks/sevensteps/index.html\"><i>Magnetism Manual of the Magnetism Club of America</i></a></li></ul>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw2247\nCached time: 20180914075018\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.008 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.013 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 21/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 0/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:782207-0!canonical and timestamp 20180914075018 and revision id 855353422\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[{"lang":"ar","url":"https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%88%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A9","langname":"Arabic","autonym":"\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629","*":"\u0631\u0627\u0644\u0633\u062a\u0648\u0646\u064a\u0629"}],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","*":"Health_movements"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Diets"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Social_movements_in_the_United_States"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Social_philosophy"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Pseudoscience"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Ralston_Purina"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Archaeology (magazine)"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Caucasian race"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Chex"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Cookie Crisp"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Hopewell Valley"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Nestl\u00e9 Purina PetCare"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"New Jersey"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Personal magnetism"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Pseudonym"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Ralcorp"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Self-help"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Social movement"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Ventriloquism"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Webster Edgerly"},{"ns":0,"*":"The Magnetism Club of America"}],"templates":[],"images":[],"externallinks":["http://archive.archaeology.org/0405/abstracts/ralston.html","http://www.oddbooks.com/edgerly/review.html","https://archive.org/details/lifebuildingmeth00ralsiala","https://archive.org/details/bookofgeneralmem00ralsrich","https://web.archive.org/web/20110529215126/http://www.neurolinguistic.com/pnl/scannedebooks/sevensteps/index.html"],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"References","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Ralstonism","byteoffset":3899,"anchor":"References"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"External links","number":"2","index":"2","fromtitle":"Ralstonism","byteoffset":4094,"anchor":"External_links"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Ralstonism","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q7288390"}]}}
