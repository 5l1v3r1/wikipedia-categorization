Pinopods (also known as pinopodes and uterodomes) are apical epithelial cellular protrusions of the endometrium of the uterus.  Pinopods have a pinocytotic role (hence the name pinopod - Greek for "drinking foot"), as well as a secretory role,  however their usefulness as a marker for endometrial receptivity is still debated in the current literature.  Pinopods also absorb uterine fluid, this 'suction' effect, brings the blastocyst nearer to the endometrium and immobilise it.
