Prunella Mary Briance (n√©e Chapman) was Founder of the National Childbirth Trust and a passionate campaigner to improve the health of women and their experience in childbirth. The NCT was founded in 1956 and is a prominent organisation in the UK which provides ante and post natal support for parents. Her work changed the landscape of healthcare provision for maternal health. Briance suffered two traumatic childbirth experiences and set about to change the situation for many women who followed  .She advertised in The Times newspaper  to find other mothers and supporters to found a new organisation. The response was overwhelming and the organisation grew steadily over the years  with local and regional branches .  Many of her most radical ideas at the time (such as having fathers present in labour wards) are now accepted as common practice . She died aged 91 in 2017  . The archives of the NCT are held at the Wellcome Library in London.
