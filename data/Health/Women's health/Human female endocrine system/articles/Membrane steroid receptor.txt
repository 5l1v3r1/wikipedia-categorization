Membrane steroid receptors (mSRs), also called extranuclear steroid receptors, are a class of cell surface receptors activated by endogenous steroids that mediate rapid, non-genomic signaling via modulation of intracellular signaling cascades.     mSRs are another means besides classical nuclear steroid hormone receptors (SHRs) for steroids to mediate their biological effects.     SHRs can produce slow genomic responses or rapid, non-genomic responses in the case of mSRs.  Known groups of mSRs include:
