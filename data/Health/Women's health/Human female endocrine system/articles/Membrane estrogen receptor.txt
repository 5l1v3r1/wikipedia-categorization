Membrane estrogen receptors (mERs) are a group of receptors which bind estrogen.   Unlike the estrogen receptor (ER), a nuclear receptor which mediates its effects via genomic mechanisms, mERs are cell surface receptors which rapidly alter cell signaling via modulation of intracellular signaling cascades.  Putative mERs include membrane-associated ERα (mERα) and ERβ (mERβ), GPER (GPR30), ER-X, ERx, and Gq-mER.
