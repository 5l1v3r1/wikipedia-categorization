Gonadotropic cells are endocrine cells in the anterior pituitary that produce the gonadotropins, such as the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH).  Release of FSH and LH by gonadotropes is regulated by gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus.  Gonadotropes appear basophilic in histological preparations. Gonadotropes have insulin receptors, which can be overstimulated by too high insulin levels. This may lead to infertility as hormone release levels are disrupted.   Gonadotropes are feedback inhibited by specific hormones, including estradiol.
