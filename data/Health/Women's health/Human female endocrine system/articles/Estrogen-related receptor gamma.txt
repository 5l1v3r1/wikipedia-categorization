It behaves as a constitutive activator of transcription.  This protein is a member of nuclear hormone receptor  family of steroid hormone receptors. No physiological activating ligand is known for this orphan receptor, but 4-hydroxytamoxifen and diethylstilbestrol act as inverse agonists and deactivate ESRRG.  It also seems to be the target of bisphenol A (see below). There is evidence that bisphenol A functions as an endocrine disruptor by binding strongly to ERR-γ.  BPA as well as its nitrated and chlorinated metabolites seems to binds strongly to ERR-γ (dissociation constant = 5.5 nM), but not to the estrogen receptor (ER).,   BPA binding to ERR-γ preserves its basal constitutive activity.  It can also protect it from deactivation from the selective estrogen receptor modulator 4-hydroxytamoxifen.  Different expression of ERR-γ in different parts of the body may account for variations in bisphenol A effects. For instance, ERR-γ has been found in high concentration in the placenta, explaining reports of high bisphenol A accumulation there.
