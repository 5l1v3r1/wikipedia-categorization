A blocked milk duct is a blockage of one or more ducts carrying milk to the nipple for the purpose of breastfeeding. The symptoms are a tender, localised lump in one breast, with redness in the skin over the lump. The cause of a blocked milk duct is the failure to remove milk from part of the breast. This may be due to infrequent breastfeeding, poor attachment, tight clothing or trauma to the breast. Sometimes the duct to one part of the breast is blocked by thickened milk. A blocked milk duct can be managed by improving the removal of milk and correcting the underlying cause.  The mother can be instructed to feed from the affected breast frequently and gently massage the breast over the lump while her baby is suckling. Some mothers find it helpful to apply warm compresses, and to vary the position of the baby (across her body or under her arm). Sometimes after gentle massage over the lump, a string of the thickened milk comes out through the nipple, followed by a stream of milk, and rapid relief of the blocked duct.  A blocked milk duct can result from a nipple bleb. Both of these can lead to mastitis.
