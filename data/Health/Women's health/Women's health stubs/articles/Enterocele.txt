An enterocele or enterocoele is a protrusion of the small intestines and peritoneum into the vaginal canal.   It may be treated transvaginally  or by laparoscopy. An enterocele may also obstruct the rectum, leading to symptoms of obstructed defecation.  Enteroceles can form after treatment for gynegological cancers.
