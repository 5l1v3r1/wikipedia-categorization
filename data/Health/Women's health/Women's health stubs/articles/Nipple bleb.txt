A nipple bleb is a blister on the nipple that can be filled with serous fluid or another fluid. It may be pink or light yellow colour.  It is thin-walled and may appear as a small blister. It is defined as being more than 5Â mm in diameter. It can also be referred to as a bulla. Some clinicians may also include milk blisters as a type of bleb. In addition, a blocked Montgomery glad may also be called a nipple bleb though its cause is different than a milk or serous-filled bleb on the nipple.  In some cases the bleb may be associated with an adjacent blocked sebaceous cyst.  Its cause may be due to a blocked pore that leads to seepage of milk or serous fluid under the epidermis. This causes a white 'bump' that appears opaque and shiny. If the bleb continues to block the flow of milk out of the breast it may develop into a blocked milk duct or even mastitis.  A nipple bleb is often treated by the woman herself since a warm saline soak and gentle washing may open the blister and cause it to drain.
