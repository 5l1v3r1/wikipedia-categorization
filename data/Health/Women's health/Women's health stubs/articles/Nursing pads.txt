A nursing pad is a cloth or disposable pad worn against the nipple and breast of a nursing mother to absorb any milk that may leak between feedings. It is inserted between the bra and the breast. Disposable pads are common and located easily online or in specialty stores. Reusable cloth pads can be washed and used over. These may be less expensive. Changing the pad when it is wet will keep the nipple clean and dry.
