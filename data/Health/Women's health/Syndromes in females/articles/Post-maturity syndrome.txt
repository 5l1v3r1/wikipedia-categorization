Post-maturity syndrome develops in about 20% of human pregnancies continuing past the expected dates.  Features of post-maturity syndrome include oligohydramnios, meconium aspiration, macrosomia and fetal problems such as dry peeling skin, overgrown nails, abundant scalp hair, visible creases on palms and soles, minimal fat deposition and skin colour become green or yellow due to meconeum staining. If there are no maternal or fetal complications, labour can be induced after assessing the favourability of the cervix and excluding cephalo-pelvic disproportions. Otherwise emergency lower segment Caesarean section (LSCS) should be made. The syndrome was first described by Stewart H. Clifford in 1954.
