Breast diseases can be classified either with disorders of the integument, or disorders of the reproductive system. A majority of breast diseases are noncancerous.  A breast neoplasm is an abnormal mass of tissue in the breast as a result of neoplasia. A breast neoplasm may be benign, as in fibroadenoma, or it may be malignant, in which case it is termed breast cancer. Either case commonly presents as a breast lump. Approximately 7% of breast lumps are fibroadenomas and 10% are breast cancer, the rest being other benign conditions or no disease.  Phyllodes tumor is a fibroepithelial tumor which can either benign, borderline or malignant. Among women worldwide, breast cancer is the most common cause of cancer death.  Breast self-examination (BSE) is an easy but unreliable method for finding possible breast cancer.  Factors that  appear to be implicated in decreasing the risk of, early diagnosis of, or recurrence of breast cancer are regular breast examinations by health care professionals, regular mammograms, self-examination of breasts, healthy diet, and exercise to decrease excess body fat.  Also called:  fibrocystic breast disease, chronic cystic mastitis, diffuse cystic mastopathy, mammary dysplasia These may be caused among others by trauma, secretory stasis/milk engorgement, hormonal stimulation, infections or autoimmune reactions. Repeated occurrence unrelated to lactation requires endocrinological examination.
