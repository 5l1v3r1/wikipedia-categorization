Mammary myofibroblastoma, abbreviated MMFB, (aka "Wargotz tumor") is a rare, benign tumor of the breast. These tumors are painless masses that manifest as  breast lumps and may be found on a mammogram. The diagnosis is based on examination under a microscope, by a pathologist.  Radiologic findings may be suggestive, as these tumors are well-circumscribed and devoid of calcifications. Myofibroblastoma of the breast, first described by Wargotz et al. {Am J Surg Pathol. 1987 Jul;11(7):493-502} consist of bland spindle cells arranged in fascicles with interspersed thick bundles of collagen.   They typically stain with CD34 and desmin.  In extra-mammary sites the tumour is known as a mammary-type myofibroblastoma, and may immunohistochemically and histomorphologically overlap with spindle cell lipoma.  Mammary myofibroblastomas are cured if completely excised. Intermed. mag. High mag.
