Vaginal stenosis is an abnormal condition in which the vagina becomes narrower and shorter due to the formation of fibrous tissue.   Vaginal stenosis can have a negative impact on sexual dysfunction, dyspareunia and make pelvic exams difficult and painful.  The lining of the vagina may also be thinner and drier and contain scar tissue. This condition can result in pain during sexual intercourse or a pelvic exam. Vaginal stenosis is often caused by an episiotomy, radiation therapy to the pelvis or some types of surgery.     Chemotherapy can also increase the likelihood of developing vaginal stenosis.  Vaginal stenosis can be a defect caused by congenital adrenal hyperplasia.  Having an episiotomy is associated with stenosis.  Uterine, vaginal, rectal and cervical cancers are often treated with pelvic radiation therapy (RT). Radiation-induced vaginal stenosis can be a side effect of treatment.  Causes are external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), or brachytherapy.  It is one of the most prevalent side effects of pelvic radiation, affecting about one third of women.   Radiation-induced stenosis can be a late reaction to treatment. Damage to the vaginal epithelium causes abnormal collagen production that leads to atrophy, loss of muscle, decreased blood flow,  hypoxia, and fibrosis. Pallor, adhesions, and fragility can be observed along with loss of elasticity.  The inadequate prenatal suppression of adrenal androgens leads to congenital adrenal hyperplasia. This condition can result in the vagia being affected by stenosis as a result.  Stenosis of the vagina is treated with vaginal dilator therapy, but the evidence is lacking for its efficacy.
