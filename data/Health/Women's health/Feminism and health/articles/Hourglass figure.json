The other shapes are the rectangular, inverted triangle, and spoon. The hourglass shape is defined by a woman's body measurements- the circumference of the bust, waist and hips. Hourglass body shapes have a wide bust, a narrow waist, and wide hips with a similar measurement to that of the bust. This body shape is aptly named for its resemblance to that of an <a href=\"/wiki/Hourglass\" title=\"Hourglass\">hourglass</a> where the upper and lower half are wide and roughly equal while the middle is narrow in circumference, making the overall shape <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Wide:narrow:wide&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Wide:narrow:wide (page does not exist)\">wide:narrow:wide</a>.

Sex-typical body shapes (a man's muscular physique and a woman's hourglass figure) are an outcome of evolutionary adaptation for reproductive fitness because they convey information about gene quality, health and fertility, which are important elements for mate selection.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> <a href=\"/wiki/Bipedalism\" title=\"Bipedalism\">Bipedalism</a> may be related to the differences of the female and male body shapes. During <a href=\"/wiki/Pregnancy\" title=\"Pregnancy\">pregnancy</a> a woman's body is transformed so it is properly able to carry the baby. To prevent the center of gravity in a women's body from being off balance, it is believed that <a href=\"/wiki/Evolution\" title=\"Evolution\">evolution</a> could have favored fat deposits in the gluteal region and the thighs.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Body_Weight_and_Hormones\">Body Weight and Hormones</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Hourglass_figure&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Body Weight and Hormones\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>When it comes to Body Weight and Hormones, it is dependent on a female's family background and what changes she can expect while she goes through puberty. Fat distribution in women is at its highest from their early teens to late middle age. <a href=\"/wiki/Sex_hormones\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sex hormones\">Sex hormones</a> play an important role in specific regions of the body helping with the regulation and accumulation of fat. Fat distribution occurs in women because <a href=\"/wiki/Estrogen\" title=\"Estrogen\">estrogen</a> lessens the adipose distribution to the abdominal region and stimulates fat growth in the gluteofemoral region. <a href=\"/wiki/Testosterone\" title=\"Testosterone\">Testosterone</a>, on the other hand, has the opposite effect. While estrogen lessens the production of fat in the abdominal region, testosterone stimulates the growth of fat in the abdominal region. This distribution means that women are more likely to be curvy thus making the hourglass figure a desirable and somewhat achievable body type.<sup id=\"cite_ref-:1_1-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:1-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"History\">History</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Hourglass_figure&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: History\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The first representations of truly fashionable women appear in the 14th century. Between the 14th and 16th centuries in northern Europe, bulging bellies were deemed desirable, however the rest of the figure was generally thin. This is most easily visible in paintings of nudes from the time. When looking at clothed images, the belly is often visible through a mass of otherwise concealing, billowing, loose robes. Since the stomach was the only visible anatomical feature, it became exaggerated in nude depictions while the rest of the body was de-emphasized. This was true in southern Europe around the time of the <a href=\"/wiki/Renaissance\" title=\"Renaissance\">renaissance</a>. Though the classical aesthetic was being revived and studied, the art produced in the time period was influenced by both factors. This resulted in a beauty standard that reconciled the two aesthetics by using classically proportioned figures who had non-classical amounts of flesh and soft, padded skin.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources. (April 2018)\">citation needed</span></a></i>&#93;</sup> In the nude paintings of the 17th century, such as those by <a href=\"/wiki/Rubens\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Rubens\">Rubens</a>, the naked women appear quite fat. Upon closer inspection however, most of the women have fairly normal figures- Rubens has simply painted their flesh with rolls and ripples that otherwise would not be there. This may be a reflection of the female style of the day: a long, cylindrical, corseted gown with rippling satin accents. Thus Rubens' women have a tubular body with rippling embellishments. While the corset continued to be fashionable into the 18th century, it shortened, became more conical, and consequently began to emphasize the waist. It also lifted and separated the breasts as opposed to the 17th century corsets which compressed and minimized the breasts. Consequently, depictions of nude women in the 18th century tend to have a very narrow waist and high, distinct breasts, almost as if they were wearing an invisible corset. <a href=\"/wiki/La_maja_desnuda\" title=\"La maja desnuda\">La maja desnuda</a> is a clear example of this aesthetic. The 19th century maintained the general figure of the 18th century. Examples can be seen in the works of many contemporary artists, both academic artists, such as <a href=\"/wiki/Cabanel\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cabanel\">Cabanel</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Ingres\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Ingres\">Ingres</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Bouguereau\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Bouguereau\">Bouguereau</a>, and impressionists, such as <a href=\"/wiki/Degas\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Degas\">Degas</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Renoir\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Renoir\">Renoir</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Toulouse-Lautrec\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Toulouse-Lautrec\">Toulouse-Lautrec</a>. As the 20th century began, the rise of athletics resulted in a drastic slimming of the female figure. This culminated in the 1920s <a href=\"/wiki/Flapper\" title=\"Flapper\">flapper</a> look, which has informed modern fashion ever since.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources.

The 1920s was the time in which the overall silhouette of the ideal body slimmed down. There was dramatic flattening of the entire body resulting in a more youthful aesthetic.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources.

It accentuated the women's waist by compressing and reducing its size by force to allow a woman who had a straight figure have the pleasure of displaying the hourglass shape. The <a href=\"/wiki/Corset\" title=\"Corset\">corset</a> is iconic with the image of a woman being helped by her maids.

Even though the corsets of this time were able to give women the body of their dreams, it was also very harmful and damaging to their bodies over time.
