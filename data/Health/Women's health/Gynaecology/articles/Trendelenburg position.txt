In the  Trendelenburg position, the body is laid supine, or flat on the back with the feet higher than the head by 15-30 degrees. The reverse Trendelenburg position similarly has the body flat, but the head is 15-30 degrees higher than the feet. The Trendelenburg position is used frequently in surgery, especially of the abdomen and genitourinary system. It allows better access to the pelvic organs as gravity pulls the intra-abdominal organs away from the pelvis. The position was named for the German surgeon Friedrich Trendelenburg (1844 â€“ 1924).  Despite the lack of evidence to support it, the Trendelenburg position is often used for patients in hypovolemic shock, with the goal of maintaining blood flow to the brain.  Most recent use of the Reverse Trendelenburg procedure is in that of minimally invasive glaucoma surgery, also known as MIGS. This position is commonly used for a superior sitting surgeon that uses a combination of downward patient tilt, of approximately 30 to 35 degrees, microscope tilt towards themselves at the same angle and an intraoperative gonio lens or prisms that allows them to visualise the inferior trabecular meshwork. Some joysticking of the globe may be required with an appropriate goniolens to bring the meshwork into view.
