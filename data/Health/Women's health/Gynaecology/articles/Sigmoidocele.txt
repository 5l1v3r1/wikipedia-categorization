Sigmoidocele (also known as Pouch of Douglas descent) refers to a condition where the sigmoid colon descends (prolapses) into the lower pelvic cavity.    This can obstruct the rectum and cause symptoms of obstructed defecation.  Sigmoidocele normally occurs in females, and is uncommon.    The phenomenon is caused by a weak section of  fascial supports of the vagina (the uterosacral cardinal ligament complex and rectal vaginal septum), which allows a section of peritoneum containing the sigmoid colon to prolapse out of normal position and fall between the rectum and the vagina.   It is not possible to differentiate between a rectocele and a sigmoidocele on vaginal examination.  Defecating proctography will demonstrate a sigmoidocele during straining.
