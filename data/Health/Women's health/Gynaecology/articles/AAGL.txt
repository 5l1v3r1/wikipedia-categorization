AAGL (Elevating Gynecologic Surgery) is a professional association of laparoscopic surgeons dedicated to the research and advancement of minimally invasive gynecologic procedures. AAGL was founded by Jordan M. Phillips, M.D., in 1971 as the American Association of Gynecologic Laparoscopists (AAGL). Its newer name reflects its international scope, and currently it has over 8000 members spread over 110 countries.  The laparoscope, a form of endoscope, often allows surgery to be done with smaller incisions and faster recovery (that is, in a minimally invasive way) compared with older open techniques. AAGL was established with the goal of serving women with the best medical procedure related to Women's Health. Since inception the society has held dialogues, discussed and shared views on minimally invasive procedures.  AAGL provides a number of Continuing Medical Education (CME) events to its members throughout the year, including the AAGL Global Congress on Minimally Invasive Gynecology held each November. AAGL publishes the advancements in gynecologic laparoscopy and other conference proceedings in the Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology, a part of AAGL.  AAGL has over 40 collaborations with sister societies around the world which include the North America, South America, European Union, Africa, Australasia & Asia.
