A vaginal dilator (sometimes called a vaginal trainer ) is an instrument used to gently stretch the vagina. They are used when the vagina has become narrowed (vaginal stenosis), such as after brachytherapy for gynecologic cancers,  and as therapy for vaginismus and other forms of dyspareunia.  There is mixed evidence for their use, and studies have reported psychological damage from dilator treatment. Rectovaginal fistulae have also been linked to dilator use.   Vaginal dilators, also called vaginal stents, are used routinely in postoperative care for patients who have undergone sex reassignment surgery (male-to-female).  The dilator is used immediately after surgery to keep the passage from healing, and regularly thereafter to maintain the viability of the neovagina.  Frequency of use requirements decrease over time, but remains obligatory lifelong.
