Vaginal cytology is a microscopic examination of cells from the vaginal epithelium. In mammals, it shows the stages of the menstrual or estrous cycle because the vaginal epithelium changes in response to sex hormone levels; practically, it is used to distinguish when a female canine is at a particular point in the estrous cycle.  In normal vaginal smear, lactational cells, navicular cells, endocervical cells, endometrial cells, trophoblastic cells and leucocytes may be present.
