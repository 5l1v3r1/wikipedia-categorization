In human reproduction, a live birth occurs when a fetus, whatever its gestational age, exits the maternal body and subsequently shows any sign of life, such as voluntary movement, heartbeat, or pulsation of the umbilical cord, for however brief a time and regardless of whether the umbilical cord or placenta are intact.  This definition of the term "live birth" was created by the World Health Organization in 1950 and is chiefly used for public health and statistical purposes. Whether the birth is vaginal or by Caesarean section, and whether the neonate is ultimately viable, is not relevant to this statistical definition.  However, the term "live birth" was in common use long before 1950.  In the United States, the term "born alive" is defined by federal statute.  Some women have chosen to release online videos of the live births of their infants.    There is one case report of a woman having a live birth derived from a frozen embryo obtained before the woman began cancer treatment.
