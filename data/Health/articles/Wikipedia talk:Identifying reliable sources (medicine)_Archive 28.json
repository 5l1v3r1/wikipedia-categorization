In addition, on more obscure pages non-MEDRS info might end up remaining indefinitely. In short, it's obviously better if users are aware of MEDRS before they attempt to add content to medical articles so that they're less likely to attempt to insert content that fails MEDRS.\n</p><p>I would propose that the first time a logged-in user starts to edit a page within the subcategory of <a href=\"/wiki/Category:Medicine\" title=\"Category:Medicine\">Category:Medicine</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Category:Health\" title=\"Category:Health\">Category:Health</a>, they get a one-time tip informing them \"Tip: on Wikipedia, all biomedical or health content <strike>must</strike> should conform to stringent <a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:MEDRS\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Wikipedia:MEDRS\">WP:MEDRS</a> <strike>policy</strike> guidelines.\" (I suspect the Wikipedia software doesn't currently have the ability to do this, but I would argue it's reasonable here to at least ask the software team for such a feature; it's good UI practice to try to inform users of new information as they likely need it, rather than rely on a giant manual nobody's going to read up front.) This wouldn't be perfect, for example it would miss IP users, but it would be better than nothing IMHO.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/User:Rolf_h_nelson\" title=\"User:Rolf h nelson\">Rolf H Nelson</a> (<a href=\"/wiki/User_talk:Rolf_h_nelson\" title=\"User talk:Rolf h nelson\">talk</a>) 05:03, 10 April 2018 (UTC)\n</p>\n<dl><dd>1. How are we going to know a newbie is about to edit a new article? In the example above, Czechboy1 has made a single edit. (I am disregarding the suggestion at Category linkage might work.) 2.

If the user is creating a new medical article, obviously we can't catch that. If the user is editing an existing article within the tree of the given categories, on the classic interface, the tip could show when above the edit box as a small note, same as when you edit \"<a href=\"/wiki/Syria_civil_war\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Syria civil war\">Syria civil war</a>\" you get a small \"article is semi-protected\" note (and a large community sanctions warning; the proposed tip would use a small rather than a large font). I'm reasonably confident some heuristic can be found that identifies a large portion of medical-related articles; because the tip is phrased as a generic tip, it won't confuse users when it occasionally shows up on a non-medical page. In the unlikely event no decent heuristic can be found, we can consider the proposal void. <a href=\"/wiki/User:Rolf_h_nelson\" title=\"User:Rolf h nelson\">Rolf H Nelson</a> (<a href=\"/wiki/User_talk:Rolf_h_nelson\" title=\"User talk:Rolf h nelson\">talk</a>) 06:37, 11 April 2018 (UTC)\n<dl><dd><small><span class=\"template-ping\">@<a href=\"/wiki/User:Rolf_h_nelson\" title=\"User:Rolf h nelson\">Rolf h nelson</a>:</span> The Syria Civil War article gets a popup warning because an Admin has placed a protective template on the particular article.  \u2013 <a href=\"/wiki/User:Srich32977\" title=\"User:Srich32977\">S.

Great idea, I'll start doing that from now on when reverting new users. <a href=\"/wiki/User:Rolf_h_nelson\" title=\"User:Rolf h nelson\">Rolf H Nelson</a> (<a href=\"/wiki/User_talk:Rolf_h_nelson\" title=\"User talk:Rolf h nelson\">talk</a>) 06:37, 11 April 2018 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd>\n<dd>I had a look at the edits <a href=\"/wiki/User:Rolf_h_nelson\" title=\"User:Rolf h nelson\">Rolf H Nelson</a> reverted. They appear to be very well accepted facts these days. So, you reverted information that was likely correct, that you haven't actually contested, purely because you believe the sources fail MEDRS. You also, incorrectly, state MEDRS is a \"higher standard\" and above claim it is \"policy\". These are not true. MEDRS is a guideline and as such, the application of policy (WP:V and WP:OR -- especially WP:WEIGHT) to the medical domain. That is all. There is no way that MEDRS would have been accepted as a guideline on WP if it was judged to be a higher or different standard to policy. Please don't make such claims, as it will only encourage folk to seek its removal.</dd>\n<dd>I am very tempted to revert you Rolf, but I'm not a reverty sort of editor. Your job, as an experienced wikipedian, is to welcome this user (their talk page is still a red link) and guide them towards making better edits. One way would be for you to search for better sources yourself -- I'm absolutely sure they'll exist -- and substitute them, explaining to the newbie why they are better. If you don't have access to such sources, you can make a request for others to search at WP:MED. In the mean time, I wonder if you would self-revert please. Reverts are seen by normal people as a slap in the face and by newbies as a \"go away\". That editor may have struggled for a while to locate the sources and cite them. All their work is now erased. I really, really, wish WP:MED folk would learn not to use revert as a solution to all, and not to take such a dogmatic approach to MEDRS. It is merely a guideline. The only time WP:V requires you to remove text that is unsourced or badly sourced, is BLP. Otherwise a better approach is to source it yourself, or add a tag, or open a discussion on the talk page. Removing text that is likely to be able to be sourced to MEDRS standards is basically a POINTy edit, and disruptive as you've removed encyclopaedic information. We're here to collaborate with others to build a great encyclopaedia, and reverting new users is nether collaborative nor building.</dd>\n<dd>If there's anywhere that needs a warning, it is MEDRS: something about \"Reverting per MEDRS is the least helpful thing you can do\". -- <a href=\"/wiki/User:Colin\" title=\"User:Colin\">Colin</a>\u00b0<a href=\"/wiki/User_talk:Colin\" title=\"User talk:Colin\"><sup>Talk</sup></a> 07:10, 10 April 2018 (UTC)</dd>\n<dd>I've just had another look at the article. There are several other sources that are primary research studies. So this newbie will be doubly confused that you kept those. MEDRS helps you choose better sources and use sources that establish WP:WEIGHT. We should remove information that you know to be wrong or that wouldn't be claimed by those better sources or that fail to have weight/consensus in the literature, or because the added information is already in the article, etc. The lead of that article mentions a study but provides no citation. -- <a href=\"/wiki/User:Colin\" title=\"User:Colin\">Colin</a>\u00b0<a href=\"/wiki/User_talk:Colin\" title=\"User talk:Colin\"><sup>Talk</sup></a> 07:29, 10 April 2018 (UTC)\n<dl><dd>Thanks for correcting me; it is indeed a guideline rather than a policy. Re \"Removing text that is likely to be able to be sourced to MEDRS standards is basically a POINTy edit\": The added content is unlikely to be sourceable to the MEDRS standards as the MEDRS standards are currently written. Also, I and many other editors believe that often dubious material should be deleted rather than tagged, and current policy allows editors to choose to do either approach. Sorry we don't see eye-to-eye on the revert, now can we get back to the original question I asked? <a href=\"/wiki/User:Rolf_h_nelson\" title=\"User:Rolf h nelson\">Rolf H Nelson</a> (<a href=\"/wiki/User_talk:Rolf_h_nelson\" title=\"User talk:Rolf h nelson\">talk</a>) 06:37, 11 April 2018 (UTC)\n<dl><dd>The problem is that you haven't actually established that the article text is \"dubious\". Only that you find the sources to be less than ideal per some guideline. Are you really telling me that <i>\"Other problems arising from lack of sleep include poor academic or work performance, lower or slower cognition, and trouble concentrating.\"</i> cannot be sourced to MEDRS standards? And the statement <i>\"Some researchers believe that girls are more prone to the impacts on sleep from electronic media due to their on average higher usage of social media, leading them to stay up longer and be engaged with electronic media up until bedtime.\"</i> is a totally verifiable fact: some researchers do believe this and here's the published paper. The only question with the last statement is whether per <a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:WEIGHT\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Wikipedia:WEIGHT\">WP:WEIGHT</a> that observation/opinion is accepted to the degree that warrants mention in this article. So, wrt the original question, definitely not per <a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_do_not_bite_the_newcomers\" title=\"Wikipedia:Please do not bite the newcomers\">Wikipedia:Please do not bite the newcomers</a>. We cannot expect newbies to get it all right first time. Sorry, but your post on the guy's talk page \" if you want to rework the material and try again with stronger sources.\" is totally wrong on a collaborative editing project. Please read <a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:About\" title=\"Wikipedia:About\">Wikipedia:About</a>. We aren't here to ensure every fact is 100% correct and well stated and sourced to an RCT at all times. The evidence of that is the poor quality of much of the rest of that article, which you seem happy to ignore. Wikipedia is a work in progress and always will be. That means experienced editors at WP:MED help inexperienced editors, and lead by example. Reverting is the least constructive, by its very definition, thing you can do on Wikipedia, and reverting without immediately starting a discussion to achieve consensus for new/modified material, is the least collaborative thing you can do on Wikipedia.   -- <a href=\"/wiki/User:Colin\" title=\"User:Colin\">Colin</a>\u00b0<a href=\"/wiki/User_talk:Colin\" title=\"User talk:Colin\"><sup>Talk</sup></a> 20:36, 11 April 2018 (UTC)\n<dl><dd>Seems like all of this should be on the relevant article's talk page rather than here, it being a separate discussion from whether or not there should be some sort of additional reference to this guideline when someone attempts to edit a medical article.--<a href=\"/wiki/User:Tronvillain\" title=\"User:Tronvillain\">tronvillain</a> (<a href=\"/wiki/User_talk:Tronvillain\" title=\"User talk:Tronvillain\">talk</a>) 21:04, 11 April 2018 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"New_article_on_review_articles\">New article on review articles</span></h2>\n<p>With respect to <a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:MEDASSESS\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Wikipedia:MEDASSESS\">WP:MEDASSESS</a>, editors may find this new article by <a href=\"/wiki/Trish_Greenhalgh\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Trish Greenhalgh\">Trish Greenhalgh</a> <i>et al.</i> interesting on what reviews when are useful: <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/eci.12931\">\"Time to challenge the spurious hierarchy of systematic over narrative reviews?\"</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Digital_object_identifier\" title=\"Digital object identifier\">doi</a>:<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111%2Feci.12931\">10.1111/eci.12931</a>. <a href=\"/wiki/User:Bondegezou\" title=\"User:Bondegezou\">Bondegezou</a> (<a href=\"/wiki/User_talk:Bondegezou\" title=\"User talk:Bondegezou\">talk</a>) 12:32, 18 April 2018 (UTC)\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Canine_medicine\">Canine medicine</span></h2>\n<p>Does <a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:MEDRS\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Wikipedia:MEDRS\">WP:MEDRS</a> apply to canine medicine?

The similarity of that with this case is that <a href=\"/wiki/PCORI\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"PCORI\">PCORI</a> and Consumer Reports both have expertise in determining what technical medical information to lay audiences need and how to make that information easy to understand. Most of the focus in health communication is at United States 4th grade educational level; PCORI and CR have a history of aiming for 8th grade level while showcasing some evidence at the undergraduate college level. This is true even for guides like this targeted to clinicians. Clinicians like anyone else prefer well-written, easy to understand writing when they can trust it and it is available.</li></ul>\n<dl><dd>Wiki community consensus was that the sources were tertiary as Looie is saying. However, even though these documents say they are for clinicians, they are actually very readable for interested layman audiences. I advise to dual cite with sources like these even when a statement also cites the authoritative academic source because Wikipedia promotes accessibility of information alongside the technical sources. I do not advocate this for all layman sources, but when there is some prominent patient advocate like <a href=\"/wiki/PCORI\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"PCORI\">PCORI</a> or Consumer Reports taking a position that a certain topic needs a special media campaign to communicate it, that is supporting evidence that they as experts have identified an accessibility issue in the available sources. Wikipedia is both readable and correct, and it is okay to draw on correct readable sources to guide the level of precision which Wikipedia presents.</dd>\n<dd>As an aside, I have some documentation about sharing information from this campaign at <a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Choosing_Wisely\" title=\"Wikipedia:Choosing Wisely\">Wikipedia:Choosing Wisely</a>, but it can be hard to follow because I made that before the advent of automated reports in <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Pageviews_Analysis\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"meta:Pageviews Analysis\">meta:Pageviews Analysis</a>.

This kind of source is opinion, and as long as the source is reliable as well as the writer, and as long as health claims are not being made, is acceptable. Its probably a good idea as the example here shows, to reference the writer by name rather than post in Wikipedia's voice. If we are going to remove this kind of  content and I'd say again the publication and writer for  the publication have to be reliable then we can get rid of the same kind of opinion in other articles. A good example is the content added and sourced to David Gorski on his blog/blogs. Do we want to get rid of that content. General consensus seems to be we don't.(<a href=\"/wiki/User:Littleolive_oil\" title=\"User:Littleolive oil\">Littleolive oil</a> (<a href=\"/wiki/User_talk:Littleolive_oil\" title=\"User talk:Littleolive oil\">talk</a>) 15:11, 29 May 2018 (UTC))</dd>\n<dd>I'd add that I have edited a little on this article.(<a href=\"/wiki/User:Littleolive_oil\" title=\"User:Littleolive oil\">Littleolive oil</a> (<a href=\"/wiki/User_talk:Littleolive_oil\" title=\"User talk:Littleolive oil\">talk</a>) 15:11, 29 May 2018 (UTC))\n<dl><dd>I think Littleolive oil puts it well \u2014 it is a good idea to qualify this with who said it, or that it was from the New Yorker \u2014 if for no other reason than that this strengthens the message as opposed to \"some claim\". MEDRS applies only to medical claims, so to answer your question if MEDRS applies to everything in an article: <b>No</b>.</dd>\n<dd>However, \"<i>popularity</i>\" or \"<i>prevalence of use</i>\" is a medical claim and most often falls under MEDRS. The popularity of \"alternative medicine\" is subject to epidemiological research, and it is often heavily overstated by practitioners \u2014 so there MEDRS applies. Your topic <a href=\"/wiki/User:Violetriga\" title=\"User:Violetriga\">violetriga</a>, is an edge case and it would be a stretch to suggest that such research exists to cover <a href=\"/wiki/Young_blood_transfusion\" title=\"Young blood transfusion\">young blood transfusions</a>. I would be comfortable using the New Yorker to claim a \"trend\". At the very least one could use it to claim a trend in media-coverage, if it does not specifically suggest that the prevalence is going up.

They examined the patients, injected the rats, filled the test tubes, or at least supervised those who did. Many, but not all, papers published in medical journals are primary sources for facts about the research and discoveries made.\"  This is overly simplistic.  More accurately, a primary source is the data set, interview transcripts, etc., from which the findings are derived.  If the current definition of primary source was used consistently on Wikipedia then many if not most of the citations on medical articles would have to be removed as primary research.  This definition seems to be applied selectively editors which results in edits being reverted because of this definition of a primary source.  There are literally thousands of valid citations on Wikipedia that fall afoul of the very broad definition used here.  <a href=\"/wiki/Leukemia#cite_note-pmid16245328-19\" title=\"Leukemia\">For example</a>.

MEDRS does not address how to format a citation in order to copy content from a source to avoid adding a copyright violation to a medical article. Without proper attribution it is a copyright violation if the content was added to an article or even the talk page of any medical article. There are sources that allow content to be copied but they require proper attribution in order to use the content. Proper attribution is required for copying licensed content that is not in the public domain. See <a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Compatible_license\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Wikipedia:Compatible license\">WP:Compatible license</a>. Editors should not remove the required attribution inside the citation or quote the source in the article or on the talk page without a link to a source for content that is not in the public domain. Unattributed copying in a medical-related article or the talk page is a copyright violation. We do use copy-pasted material from a source without quoting it, when it's permissible under copyright law. Many organisations have content on their website that are in the public domain such as content on the FDA website. The <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/diseasesconditions/index.html\">CDC website</a> has a lot of medical-related content that is in the public domain. For content that is in the public domain I use the correct template for public domain content. See <a href=\"/wiki/Template:PD-notice\" title=\"Template:PD-notice\">Template:PD-notice</a>.\n</p><p>I propose we create a new section for MEDRS in order to explain how to properly use sources that have a <a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Compatible_license\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Wikipedia:Compatible license\">WP:Compatible license</a>. <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=User:QuackGuru&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"User:QuackGuru (page does not exist)\"><b style=\"color: #e34234;\">QuackGuru</b></a> (<a href=\"/wiki/User_talk:QuackGuru\" title=\"User talk:QuackGuru\"><span style=\"color: #B02200;\">talk</span></a>) 04:53, 21 July 2018 (UTC)\n</p>\n<dl><dd>While we should always encourage editors to properly cite content &#8211; including attribution of reused public domain and compatibly-licensed material &#8211; the copyright status and proper citation method for a particular source don't really have anything to do with assessing the <i>reliability</i> of that source.  There may be a better place for this sort of guidance; it strikes me as out of scope here. <a href=\"/wiki/User:TenOfAllTrades\" title=\"User:TenOfAllTrades\">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href=\"/wiki/User_talk:TenOfAllTrades\" title=\"User talk:TenOfAllTrades\">talk</a>) 05:25, 21 July 2018 (UTC)\n<dl><dd>The issue is that editors are adding content to medical-related articles without the proper attribution.

I'm not sure where is the best place to explain all of this for medical-related content. <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=User:QuackGuru&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"User:QuackGuru (page does not exist)\"><b style=\"color: #e34234;\">QuackGuru</b></a> (<a href=\"/wiki/User_talk:QuackGuru\" title=\"User talk:QuackGuru\"><span style=\"color: #B02200;\">talk</span></a>) 05:34, 21 July 2018 (UTC)\n<dl><dd>Ah, okay.

That's a much more complex and nuanced discussion&#8212;but it's still not really a MEDRS-specific issue. (In circumstances where MEDRS is engaged, I would as a rule of thumb discourage the use of quotation-mark-free copying, even where licensing/copyright status might allow it.

And I generally believe articles about psychosocial topics that might not fall under the \"biomedical\" umbrella (or at least the entire article is not focused on biomedical concerns) often benefit from following guidance or policies developed by this Wikiproject such as MEDRS. Is there an essay or policy which describes the difference between \"biomedical\" and, for lack of a better term, \"definitely not biomedical\"? <a href=\"/wiki/User:Markworthen\" title=\"User:Markworthen\"><span style=\"color:#539; font-family:copperplate gothic\">&#160; - Mark D Worthen PsyD</span></a> <a href=\"/wiki/User_talk:Markworthen\" title=\"User talk:Markworthen\"><span style=\"color:#64B; font-family:times new roman\">(talk)</span></a> 21:02, 6 August 2018 (UTC)\n</p>\n<dl><dd>There is pretty much broad consensus that this means \"health\". <a href=\"/wiki/User:CFCF\" title=\"User:CFCF\"><span style=\"color:#014225;font-family: sans-serif;\">Carl Fredrik</span></a><span style=\"font-size: .90em;\"><a href=\"/wiki/User_talk:CFCF\" title=\"User talk:CFCF\"><sup> talk</sup></a></span> 22:39, 6 August 2018 (UTC)</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd>So far, we have <a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Biomedical_information\" title=\"Wikipedia:Biomedical information\">Wikipedia:Biomedical information</a> for what biomedical material is and isn't. <a href=\"/wiki/User:Flyer22_Reborn\" title=\"User:Flyer22 Reborn\">Flyer22 Reborn</a> (<a href=\"/wiki/User_talk:Flyer22_Reborn\" title=\"User talk:Flyer22 Reborn\">talk</a>) 15:30, 7 August 2018 (UTC)</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd><dl><dd>Thanks y'all! :0) <a href=\"/wiki/User:Markworthen\" title=\"User:Markworthen\"><span style=\"color:#539; font-family:copperplate gothic\">&#160; - Mark D Worthen PsyD</span></a> <a href=\"/wiki/User_talk:Markworthen\" title=\"User talk:Markworthen\"><span style=\"color:#64B; font-family:times new roman\">(talk)</span></a> 02:43, 12 August 2018 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Thank_you_and_hello\">Thank you and hello</span></h2>\n<p>Hello - \nI wanted to follow up on the helpful post from JenOttawa's post about PCORI's evidence updates for patients and clinicians. Thank you for everyone's help. I work for PCORI (the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute) and I'm slowly learning the ropes about how to share vetted, reliable sources about results from the studies we've funded. Again, thank you for your feedback so far and help in the future.
