Inle is the orisha of health and all medicinal healing in Santeria, and also in Candomblé and Palo Mayombe. Inle is a man with fine features as of a woman. He has long silky hear and wears the finest clothes. For him to look as elegant as he does, he also became the patron of homosexuals. Inle is also said to be good acquaintances with Yemaya.  In one Cuban Santería "pataki", or mythological story, the sea goddess Yemaha (Yemoja) is tricked into incestuous sex with her son Shango. To hide her shame at this event, she banished her other two sons, Inle and Abbata, to live at the bottom of the ocean, additionally cutting out Inle's tongue and making Abbata deaf. As a result of their isolation and loneliness, Inle and Abbata become passionate friends and then lovers, able to communicate emphatically. This pataki is used to explain the origin of incest, muteness, and deafness in addition to homosexuality.
