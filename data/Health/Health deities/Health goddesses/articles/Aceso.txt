Aceso (Greek: Ἀκεσώ) was the Greek goddess of the healing process.  She was the daughter of Asclepius and Epione, sister of Iaso, Hygieia, Panacea, and Aegle.  Her grandfather was Apollo. Unlike her sister Panacea (Cure-All) she represented the process of a curing rather than the cure itself. Her male counterpart was Acesis (Akesis).  In Greek sculptural reliefs, Aceso appears alongside her father Asclepius and sisters Hygeia, Panacea and Iaso.
