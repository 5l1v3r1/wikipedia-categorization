In the Aztec mythology, Temazcalteci (pronounced [temaskalˈtesi], Nahuatl temāzcalli 'sweat bath' + tecitl 'grandmother')  was the goddess of steam baths. According to Sahagún, this goddess was the goddess of medicine, Toci, venerated by doctors. She was also worshiped by those who had temazcals (baths) in their houses.
