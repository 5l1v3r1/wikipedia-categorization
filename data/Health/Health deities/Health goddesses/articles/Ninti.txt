Ninti is the Sumerian goddess of life.  Ninti is also one of the eight goddesses of healing who was created by Ninhursag to heal Enkiâ€™s body. Her specific healing area was the rib (sumerian Ti means rib and to live).  Enki had eaten forbidden flowers and was then cursed by Ninhursaga, who was later persuaded by the other gods to heal him. Some scholars suggest that this served as the basis for the story of Eve created from Adam's rib in the Book of Genesis.  The System of a Down song "Darts" from their debut eponymous album features the lyric "Arise as did the gods Ninti, arise as did the gods Ninti..."
