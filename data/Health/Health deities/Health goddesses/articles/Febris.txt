In Roman mythology, Febris ("fever") was the goddess who embodied, but also protected people from fever and malaria. Febris had three temples in ancient Rome, of which one was located between the Palatine and Velabrum.     She may have originated from the Roman god Februus. Among her characteristic attributes are "shrewdness" and "honesty", according to Seneca the Younger's Apocolocyntosis.
