 Euphoria is a game animation engine created by NaturalMotion based on Dynamic Motion Synthesis, NaturalMotion's proprietary technology for animating 3D characters on-the-fly "based on a full simulation of the 3D character, including body, muscles and motor nervous system".  Instead of using predefined animations, the characters' actions and reactions are synthesized in real-time; they are different every time, even when replaying the same scene. While it is common for current video games to use limp "ragdolls" for animations generated on the fly, Euphoria employs a more complex method to animate the entirety of physically bound objects within the game environment.  The engine was to be used in an Indiana Jones game that has since been cancelled. According to its web site, Euphoria runs on the Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, iOS and Android platforms and is compatible with all commercial physics engines. A press release that was enclosed with the second trailer eventually confirmed that Grand Theft Auto IV is the first of Rockstar's games to feature Euphoria.   Red Dead Redemption is their second game to use this engine. The Star Wars titles, Star Wars: The Force Unleashed and The Force Unleashed II use Euphoria, as do games based on the Rockstar Advanced Game Engine(RAGE) including Grand Theft Auto V. Euphoria is integrated into the source code of RAGE.
