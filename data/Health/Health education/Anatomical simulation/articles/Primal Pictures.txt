Primal Pictures Ltd is a business established in 1991 that provides a 3D graphic rendering of human anatomy, built using real scan data from the Visible Human Project, for use by healthcare medical professionals. Informa has owned all of the company since 2012, previously owning 10 per cent.  The representation of the body in Primalâ€™s software is derived from medical scan data that has been interpreted by a team of Primal anatomists and translated into three-dimensional images by graphics specialists. The anatomy visuals are accompanied by three-dimensional animations that demonstrate function, biomechanics and surgical procedures.
