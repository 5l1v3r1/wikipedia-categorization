Shots On-line is a mobile web application that is a resource on immunizations for smartphones and other handheld devices. It was developed by the Group on Immunization Education of the Society of Teachers of Family Medicine (STFM). It is available for iPhone/iPod Touch, Android, and BlackBerry devices.  Shots software is also available for standard palm and Windows based PDAs. Information is easily accessed via drop-down menus.  Shots contains the unified, ACIP-approved childhood, adolescent, adult, catch-up and medical indications schedules for the United States.  Drop-down menus provide details about every vaccine and include:  Basics, High Risk Indications, Adverse Reactions, Contraindications, Catch-Up, Administration, Risk Communications, Brand Names, Epidemiology and Pictures of Vaccine Preventable Diseases.  As new vaccines become available and recommendations are made, they are added to the applications.
