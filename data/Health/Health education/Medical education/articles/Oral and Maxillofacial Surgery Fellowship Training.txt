After completion of an accredited residency program in Oral/Maxillofacial Surgery, surgeons can complete fellowships in multiple sub specialties.  Fellowships are not limited to those with medical degrees.  There are currently no board certifications for sub specialties under AAOMS/ADA.  There are board certifications available under non-AAOMS/non-ADA boards. There are also AAOMS accredited and non-accredited fellowships by the Commission on Dental Accreditation (CODA). http://www.aaoms.org/fellowship_opportunities.php Dr. Larry M Wolford DMD - Dallas, TX Doug Sinn DDS - Mansfield, TX Dr. Peter Waite, The University of Alabama - Birmingham, Alabama The Oral Facial Surgery Institute - St John's Mercy Medical Center - St. Louis, Missouri Stanford Hospital Oral Maxillofacial Surgery Instructorship - Stanford Hospital - Palo Alto, California John Peter Smith Hospital Maxillofacial Oncology and Reconstructive Surgery Fellowship - Fort Worth, Texas D David Kim, DMD, MD, FACS, LSU Shreveport Head & Neck Oncologic/Microvascular Reconstructive Surgery - Shreveport, LA Head and Neck Oncologic Surgery Fellowship at Legacy Emanuel Hospital - Portland, Oregon University of Michigan Oncology Fellowship - Ann Arbor, Michigan University of Tennessee at Knoxville Oncology Fellowship - Knoxville, Tennessee University of Maryland Oncology and Microvascular Reconstruction Fellowship - Baltimore, Maryland University of Florida Oncology and Microvascular Reconstruction Fellowship - Jacksonville, FL Tufts University 1 Year Fellowship - Boston, MA  Loma Linda University 2 Year Professional Achievement in Implantology - Loma Linda, CA  Rutgers University 1 Year Surgical Fellowship - Newark, NJ  Southern Illinois University Restorative and Surgical Fellowship - Edwardsville, IL  Harvard University 2 Year Surgical Fellowship - Boston, MA  Loma Linda University 1 Year Surgical Fellowship - Loma Linda, CA  Indiana University Surgical and Restorative Fellowship - Indianapolis, IN  UCLA 1 Year Surgical Fellowship - Los Angeles, CA Association of oral & Maxillofacial surgeons of india http://www.ofscms.com/fellowship/index.asp Oral and Facial Surgical Center with Dr. John E Griffin Jr.  (AAOMS certified) American Academy of Cosmetic Surgery Fellowship Training Programs Maxillofacial and Facial Aesthetic Surgery - T.
