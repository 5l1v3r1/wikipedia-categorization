The Center for Integrated Health of Women, Children, and Adolescents, for example, includes at least 22 collaborations (13 on campus and partnerships in Kenya, Ethiopia, Mexico, and Peru). And the initiative on Climate Change and Global Health involves more than 25 collaborations on campus and beyond.\n</p><p>Its closely affiliated centers also include the <a href=\"/wiki/Institute_for_Health_Metrics_and_Evaluation\" title=\"Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation\">Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation</a> (IHME), the International Training and Education Center for Health (I-TECH), the International Clinical Research Center (ICRFC), the Center for AIDS Research (CFAR), Health Alliance International (HaI), and the Global Health Resource Center (GHRC).<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The Department has strong ties in Kenya, Peru, Mozambique, and Ethiopia. But worldwide, the Department works with nearly 250 collaborating organizations, including universities and hospitals, NGOs, government agencies, and ministries of health.\n</p><p>Quote from Howard Frumkin MD, MPH, Dean of the UW School of Public Health: \"Global health represents the best of academic health sciences -- transdisciplinary systems thinking, cross-cultural sensitivity, rigorous scientific research, hands-on participatory training, effective service delivery with impact empirically measured, and sustainable collaboration. This Department is outstanding. \"\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Education\">Education</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=University_of_Washington_Department_of_Global_Health&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Education\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><b>Master's Level:</b> The Department offers several global health tracks for a master of Public Health degree: General; Leadership, Policy, and Management; Health Metrics and Evaluation; Peace Corps; Epidemiology; and concurrent degrees.\n</p><p><b>Doctoral Programs:</b> The Department offers a doctoral program in Pathobiology. A doctoral program in global health with emphases on health metrics and evaluation and implementation science is in development.\n</p><p><b>Fellowship Programs:</b> The Department offers post-bachelor and post-graduate fellowship programs with the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.\n</p><p><b>Certificate Programs:</b> The Department has a certificate program in Global Health and a program in AIDS and STIs. Medical students also can take a Global Health Pathway.\n</p><p><b>Undergraduate Programs:</b> An undergraduate minor in global health was launched in January 2011.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Selection_of_the_Chair\">Selection of the Chair</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=University_of_Washington_Department_of_Global_Health&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Selection of the Chair\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/Jim_Yong_Kim\" title=\"Jim Yong Kim\">Jim Yong Kim</a>, formerly of <a href=\"/wiki/Partners_in_Health\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Partners in Health\">Partners in Health</a> and the <a href=\"/wiki/World_Health_Organization\" title=\"World Health Organization\">WHO</a> <a href=\"/wiki/HIV/AIDS\" title=\"HIV/AIDS\">HIV/AIDS</a> program, was originally a candidate for director of the department, but was not selected.  A controversial second selection process involving three new candidates took place in late 2005 and early 2006. The process was criticized for not being open, and there was concern<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> among the student body and faculty about the chosen chair. Some feared that the department would be too heavily oriented towards <a href=\"/wiki/Biomedical_research\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Biomedical research\">biomedical research</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Biotechnology\" title=\"Biotechnology\">biotechnology</a> (e.g. <a href=\"/wiki/Vaccine\" title=\"Vaccine\">vaccine</a> development) and would neglect the broader issues of public health, such as <a href=\"/wiki/Social_justice\" title=\"Social justice\">social justice</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Health_disparities\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Health disparities\">health disparities</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Preventive_medicine\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Preventive medicine\">prevention</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Health_promotion\" title=\"Health promotion\">promotion</a>, human resources in health, and <a href=\"/wiki/Public_policy\" title=\"Public policy\">public policy</a>. Some also feared that the areas of education and service would be sacrificed for a research agenda, and pointed to the fact that one of the first steps in implementing the department was the leasing of a large facility off campus in Seattle's <a href=\"/wiki/South_Lake_Union\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"South Lake Union\">South Lake Union</a> neighborhood - an area being developed as a biotechnology hub.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Those within the process argued that planning was open and that the department would be multidisciplinary and would live up to its stated vision of taking a broad approach to global health. They also noted that while the department would have some facilities off campus, it would be primarily based at the university; the deans of the schools committed to finding on-campus space to house the department's administrative offices, although much of the lab space was planned to be located in a building in the Eastlake neighborhood.\n</p><p>In Spring, 2006, Michael Merson of <a href=\"/wiki/Yale_University\" title=\"Yale University\">Yale University</a> was offered the position of director. However, in July of that year it was announced that Merson had been appointed direct of <a href=\"/wiki/Duke_University\" title=\"Duke University\">Duke University</a>'s Global Health Institute.\n</p><p>On September 8, University of Washington announced King K. Holmes, MD, PhD, a world leader in AIDS and infectious disease research and training, to become the first chair of the University of Washington's new Department of Global Health.<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> His leadership in global health research and training, and experience as a public-health practitioner, will serve Holmes well in leading the Department of Global Health, according to Paul G. Ramsey, dean of the School of Medicine.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a
