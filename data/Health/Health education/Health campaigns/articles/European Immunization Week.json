This marked a milestone in the initiative\u2019s seven-year history. Such widespread support was particularly critical for the Region as Member States work to eliminate measles and rubella by 2015 and to maintain Europe\u2019s polio-free status.

The theme was selected in the wake of <a href=\"/wiki/Polio\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Polio\">polio</a> outbreaks in the European Region in 2010. The outbreaks have clearly illustrated that when vaccine-preventable diseases spread; shared borders lead to common threats.

At the launch of EIW 2008, she stated, \u201cIt is the right of every child to grow up healthy, and vaccinated against those diseases that can so easily be controlled.
