The SEIU had been a primary organizer of the \"Justice for Janitors\" campaign.  The SEIU sought the help of South Florida Interfaith Worker Justice (SFIWJ) early in its campaign in Florida, which signaled the start of an important partnership between the movement and religious organizations.  During the fall of 2005, an ally was found in the group, Students Toward a New Democracy (STAND), which attempted to \"create an activist culture in an historically apathetic student body.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-Albright_6-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Albright-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>  In order to improve STAND's capabilities, SEIU brought in students from <a href=\"/wiki/Harvard\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Harvard\">Harvard</a> (who had previously conducted a successful three-week living wage campaign), and students from <a href=\"/wiki/Georgetown_University\" title=\"Georgetown University\">Georgetown University</a> to help teach organizational tactics to UM students.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Strike_and_protests\">Strike and protests</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=University_of_Miami_Justice_for_Janitors_campaign&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Strike and protests\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Following their majority approving an unfair labor practice strike against UNICCO on February 26, 2006, the janitors officially went on strike.  In order to show solidarity with the striking workers, over one hundred UM professors and faculty held classes off campus in venues such as churches, houses, and even a park so as to not interfere with the campaign's <a href=\"/wiki/Picketing_(protest)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Picketing (protest)\">picketing</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Albright_6-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Albright-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>  Out of the 200 UM janitors, SEIU reported that approximately half participated in the strike from the beginning.  UNICCO, however, disputed these claims, asserting that SEIU was exaggerating the numbers, and that 148 out of the 206 workers had reported for work the previous day.  At the same time the SEIU announced that a ten-day strike notice had been issued to the UM medical school, with the potential of adding 200 janitors to the work action.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Ledger_7-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Ledger-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>On March 28, members of the campaign launched a two-pronged action in an attempt to garner media attention.  First, a group of seventeen people (consisting of union members, students, clergy, and community members) formed a human chain across US Route 1 outside of the UM campus, blocking  traffic.  Just as these seventeen people were arrested, another group (consisting of seventeen students and the campus chaplain) occupied the Ashe Building which housed the UM admissions office.  After a thirteen-hour occupation,  Shalala agreed to have a meeting with the students, workers, and the SEIU.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Albright_6-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Albright-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Fasting_in_Freedom_Village\">Fasting in Freedom Village</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=University_of_Miami_Justice_for_Janitors_campaign&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Fasting in Freedom Village\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Beginning April 5, the campaign featured <a href=\"/wiki/Hunger_strikes\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hunger strikes\">hunger strikes</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Fasts\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Fasts\">fasting</a> (which took place in \"Freedom Village\"\u2014the name given to the campaign's base of operations).

SEIU originally opposed this form of protest because of the obvious health implications involved, but as they began to support the idea of hunger strikes, they also provided nurses at Freedom Village to monitor the safety of those fasting.  After more than two weeks, some people taking part in the strike were being hospitalized.  Rather than ending the hunger strike altogether, leaders decided to recruit others to do the fasting (such as SEIU president <a href=\"/wiki/Andy_Stern\" title=\"Andy Stern\">Andy Stern</a> and executive vice president <a href=\"/wiki/Eliseo_Medina\" title=\"Eliseo Medina\">Eliseo Medina</a>).
