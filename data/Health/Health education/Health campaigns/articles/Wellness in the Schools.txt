Wellness in the Schools is a nonprofit organisation that promotes healthy eating, environmental awareness and fitness for children in New York City public schools. It is led by volunteer chef Bill Telepan, a Manhattan restaurateur.  The organisation runs three programs: Cook for Kids, which recruits culinary school graduates to work with cafeteria workers to provide fresh meals for children;  Green for Kids, which promotes the use of environmentally safe cleaning products in schools;  and Coach for Kids, which trains coaches to encourage children to participate in physical activities and reduce playground bullying.
