The Stop AIDS Campaign is the previous name of a campaign run by the UK Consortium on AIDS and International Development, a coalition of more than 80 of the leading international NGOs and HIV/AIDS groups in the United Kingdom. In September 2013, the Stop AIDS Campaign and the AIDS Consortium relaunched as STOPAIDS.  Members of the network playing a leading part in the campaign include Christian Aid, CAFOD, the International HIV/AIDS Alliance, OXFAM, UNICEF UK, Restless Development (as hosts of the Student Stop AIDS Campaign) and Oxfam. The network continues to campaign to increase access to prevention, treatment, care and support services for HIV and AIDS.
