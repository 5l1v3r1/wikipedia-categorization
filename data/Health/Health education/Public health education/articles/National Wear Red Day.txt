 National Wear Red Day is a day in February when many people wear red to show their support for the awareness of heart disease. It occurs in America on the first Friday in February each year, where people wear red. The Heart Truthâ€”is a national awareness campaign for women about heart disease sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.  Designed to warn women of their #1 health threat, The Heart Truth created and introduced the Red Dress as the national symbol for women and heart disease awareness in 2002 to deliver an urgent wakeup call to American women. Wear Red Day is held every February and organised in the United Kingdom by Yorkshire based charity Children's Heart Surgery Fund to raise awareness of congenital heart disease.
