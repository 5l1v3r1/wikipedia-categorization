The mission of IVAC is to accelerate global access to vaccines through the development and implementation of evidence-based policies. As a consultant who works both nationally and internationally, Levine's knowledge of epidemiology places him in high demand. Levine's professional memberships align with his special interests. Currently, he is a steering committee member of <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.jhsph.edu/vaccineinitiative\">Johns Hopkins Vaccine Initiative (JHVI)</a>, at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, and President of the American Society of Tropical Medicine &amp; Hygiene's Committee on Global Health.

Levine's efforts, and those of PneumoADIP, are aimed at accelerating access to these life-saving vaccines so that children everywhere can benefit from them.\n</p><p>Two of his current research projects are: Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health (PERCH), which is funded by a 43 million dollar grant from the <a href=\"/wiki/Bill_and_Melinda_Gates_Foundation\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation\">Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</a><sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> and the Accelerated Vaccine Introduction (AVI) Project, which is funded by the <a href=\"/wiki/GAVI_Alliance\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"GAVI Alliance\">GAVI Alliance</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-PneumoADIP_3-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-PneumoADIP-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>  The purpose of PERCH is to achieve a greater understanding of the causes of pneumonia around the world.  Better pneumonia surveillance is critical to the global fight against this disease.  The purpose of AVI is to accelerate access to life-saving pneumococcal and rotavirus vaccines for children in the world's poorest countries.

Existing knowledge on the etiologies of childhood pneumonia is largely based on studies conducted in the 1980s and 1990s.  With expanded use of new pneumonia vaccines and changes in host and environmental factors, a new evidence base that harnesses novel diagnostic technologies is needed.\n</p><p>PERCH is a multi-center, case-control study of the etiology of severe and very severe pneumonia in children aged 1\u201359 months. With seven sites in Africa and Asia and a projected sample size of over 12,000 patients and controls, PERCH is the largest study of the etiology of pneumonia among hospitalized pediatric pneumonia patients in developing countries that has ever been undertaken. Over two years, PERCH will enroll approximately 6,500 hospitalized cases with WHO-defined severe and very severe pneumonia. Approximately the same number of community-based controls will be enrolled to assess the community prevalence of pathogens, as well as known and unstudied risk factors for pneumonia.  Seven research sites were selected to be representative of areas where most of the severe pneumonia cases in children are expected to occur in 2015. There are five sites in Africa (Gambia, Mali, Kenya, South Africa, and Zambia) and two in Asia (Bangladesh and Thailand). The study will be carried out using standardized clinical and laboratory methods and techniques, in combination with innovative diagnostic and specimen collection methods. The data will be analyzed using advanced statistical methods and their interpretation will be considered prior to the release the specific microbiologic results.\n</p><p>More information on the study protocol and the PERCH project is available at <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.jhsph.edu/ivac/perch.html\">http://www.jhsph.edu/ivac/perch.html</a>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Hib_Initiative\">The Hib Initiative</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Orin_Levine&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: The Hib Initiative\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The mission of the Hib Initiative is to expedite and execute evidence-based decisions regarding the use of Hib vaccination in order to prevent childhood meningitis and pneumonia.
