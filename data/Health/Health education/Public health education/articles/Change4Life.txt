Change4Life is a public health programme in England which began in January 2009,  run by the Department of Health. It is the country's first national social marketing campaign to tackle the causes of obesity.  Change4Life aims to help families and middle-aged adults make small, sustainable yet significant improvements to their diet, activity levels and alcohol consumption. It uses the slogan "eat well, move more, live longer". Change4Life encourages people to adopt six healthy behaviours:  Change4Life also has six sub-brands that help intermediaries to promote a single issue with either a food or an activity focus (Bike4Life,  Breakfast4Life,  Let's Dance with Change4Life,  Play4Life,  Swim4Life  and Walk4Life ). A range of resources is provided to enable them to disseminate these healthy living messages within their own context.  Change4Life adopts an integrated marketing approach and uses a variety of marketing channels including television and radio, digital, social media, PR and direct marketing. It uses animated television advertising by Aardman Animations,  as part of a wider campaign. M&C Saatchi lead on the creative aspects of the campaign with additional input from a range of other agencies providing PR, digital, planning and data services. On Channel 4, Change4Life was a previous sponsor of The Simpsons. In addition to consumer marketing, Change4Life engages with intermediaries at a local level, including schools, NHS organisations, local authorities and others.  These local supporters are able to interact with the campaign audience in different ways and in different contexts to Change4Lifeâ€™s central approach. Free resources including posters and leaflets are available to local supporters to enable them to do this effectively. Tesco has supported Change4Life using Spoon Guru's technology platform to support the campaign  .
