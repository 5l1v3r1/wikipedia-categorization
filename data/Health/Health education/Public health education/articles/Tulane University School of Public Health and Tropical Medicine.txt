Attempts to control tropical diseases led to the establishment of the Medical College of Louisiana in 1834, founded by a group of young practicing physicians. The founders issued a prospectus that emphasized the lack of knowledge of these diseases and the necessity to study them in the environment in which they occurred. In 1881, formal instruction in hygiene was offered for the first time. A gift to Tulane, $25,000 from businessman Samuel Zemurray, instituted the country's first School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in 1912. The school's launch in 1912 was significant, and as it was part of the movement to establish similar institutions around the world. It was hailed by academicians nationally and internationally as the first such school in the United States, where tropical diseases had had devastating effects, particularly in the South. The first Doctor of Public Health degree was conferred in 1914. Later, in 1919, the School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine merged back into the College of Medicine. The departments of tropical medicine and preventive medicine then merged to establish the department of tropical medicine and public health. Tulane joined the Council on Education of Public Health in 1947. With public health and tropical medicine rapidly expanding, an administrative division of graduate public health was created in 1958, and was re-designated as the Division of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in 1961. In 1967, the Hygiene and Tropical Medicine interests reverted to being its own entity of Tulane University and became today's iteration of the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine. The mission of Tulane School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine is to advance global public health and decrease health disparities through excellence in education, research, and collaborative partnerships The students, faculty, and staff represent more than 70 cultures from around the world. Students enroll from more than 40 different countries, and the school remains in the top tier of accredited schools of public health across the country.  U.S. News & World Report's 2015 edition ranked the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine 12th among public health programs.   In 2008, the school conferred the first bachelor of science in public health degrees to the first undergraduate class of Tulane public health graduates. Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2012.  The school also has a joint degree program with Tulane's School of Medicine, offering the MD/MPH degree. It is the oldest such program in the country, as well as the largest.
