EPERC (End-of-Life/Palliative Education Resource Center) is a peer reviewed health professional education clearinghouse at the Medical College of Wisconsin for palliative care educational material. It was established in 1999 through funding by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and is now supported by MCW, sales, gifts, and grants. EPERC contains Fast Facts and Concepts, descriptions of educational material by content area and educational format, "starter kits" for health educators planning palliative care educational projects, and other resources.
