In 2014 it ran a campaign called \"College 101\"  which looked at how college kids are using illegal drugs to stay up longer to study. Another was the \"Forget Pot\" campaign, which focused on how smoking marijuana has caused a lot of teens to fail classes or even drop out of high school. Its 2015 campaign is called \"Pick Healthy.\" This is not focused on a particular drug, but tries to get people to pick healthy fruits instead of using deadly drugs. This campaign wants people to use the \"#pickhealthy\" hastag when someone is eating a healthy treat.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Blasting_celebrities\">Blasting celebrities</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=American_Anti_Drug_Council&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Blasting celebrities\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The American Anti-Drug Council has blasted many celebrities for posting smoking selfies or drug content images.
