Health Alliance International (HAI) in a non-profit organization based in Seattle, Washington, USA. HAI is an international public health organization, and a center of the University of Washington Department of Global Health, currently working in Mozambique, East Timor, and CÃ´te d'Ivoire. HAI focuses on supporting government Ministries of Health to expand services at a national level in order to boost the overall health infrastructure of a country, and to strengthen its ability to provide sustainable sector-wide services. In Mozambique, HAI supports the Ministry of Health in building the country's HIV/AIDS treatment services. In East Timor, HAI supports the Ministry of Health to strengthen the country's maternal and newborn care services. HAI also has a history of advocacy for the right to health for the poor. HAI was founded in 1987 by Steve Gloyd. HAI is notable for its focus on a sector-wide approach to supporting health systems, rather than working "vertically" and independently of the local government.
