MaryAnn T. Lippert  (born December 21, 1953) is a Wisconsin health educator, health administrator, and Republican politician who served one term as a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly. She is currently executive assistant to the Secretary of the Wisconsin Department of Children and Families. Born in Marshfield, Wisconsin, Lippert graduated from Pittsville High School. She received a B.S. from the University of Wisconsinâ€“La Crosse 1976, and an MS from the same university in 1980. She worked for many years as a health educator. In 1998, she challenged fellow Pittsville resident and Democratic incumbent Donald W. Hasenohrl for the 70th Assembly District (portions of Portage and Wood counties) seat, coming close to defeating him (8,906 for Hasenohrl to 8,386 for Lippert) with $38,708 in campaign expenditures. Hasenohrl chose not to run for re-election in 2000, and Lippert defeated Democrat Amy Sue Vruwink by 104 votes (12,068 [50.2%] to 11,964 [49.8%]) in the 2000 general election, after spending $114,563.  Lippert served on the Assembly's Committees on Children and Families and Public Health (on both of which she served as Vice-Chair), as well as the Committees on Aging and Long-Term Care; Economic Development; Health; and Transportation.  In 2002, she chose not to run for re-election due to the health of her husband, Jerry, who was suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which he atrributed to twenty years of smoking (he was a member of the state Tobacco Control Board). She was succeeded by Vruwink.  After leaving the Assembly, Lippert went back to work in the health field. In February 2011, she was appointed as executive assistant to Eloise Anderson, the new Secretary of the Wisconsin Department of Children and Families, as part of the administration of incoming governor Scott Walker. Lippert is the mother of three children, and is a long-term resident of Pittsville, Wisconsin, where she is a member of the Pittsville School District board of education.
