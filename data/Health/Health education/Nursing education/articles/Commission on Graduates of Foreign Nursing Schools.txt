CGFNS (Commission on Graduates of Foreign Nursing Schools),  located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and founded in 1977,  is an internationally recognized authority on credentials evaluation and verification pertaining to the education, registration and licensure of nurses and health care professionals across the world. It administers the Certification Program which includes the qualifying examination that is required, by some state boards of nursing,  from graduates of nursing schools located outside of the United States of America who are interested in practicing as registered nurses in the United States. It tests candidates' nursing knowledge and their understanding and use of English language skills. The successful candidates are awarded a CGFNS Certificate when they have passed both the nursing section and the English language section of the examination. CGFNS also offers the VisaScreen Program, a visa credentials assessment program, which must be successfully completed by any Registered Nurse, Licensed Practical Nurse, Audiologist, Speech Language Pathologist, Physical Therapist, Occupational Therapist, Medical Laboratory Technician, Medical Laboratory Scientist, or Nurse Practitioner seeking to obtain an occupational visa to work in the United States.  Other programs include the Credential Evaluation Service and the New York State Verification Service. CGFNS has received much criticism from the customers for the services it provided. The number of negative reviews largely outweighs the positive ones.
