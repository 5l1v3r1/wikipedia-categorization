The Lydia’s Professional Uniforms/AACN Excellence in Academics Nursing Scholarship is an award that acknowledges the important role nurses play in the health care system. It was developed based on a commitment to improving access to baccalaureate nursing education programs.  In fall 2006, a company called Lydia’s Professional Uniforms, and the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN), collaborated to form a new scholarship program for nurses enrolled in baccalaureate programs. Lydia’s Professional Uniforms is a leading retailer of medical uniforms, nursing scrubs and medical supplies for health professionals.  The AACN is an organization that, “serves the public interest by providing standards and resources, and by fostering innovation to advance professional nursing education, research, and practice."  Since the collaboration between the AACN and Lydia’s Uniforms, scholarships have been awarded to two deserving students each fall and spring semester. The Lydia’s Professional Uniforms/AACN Excellence in Academics Nursing Scholarship is awarded to two recipients each fall and spring semester in the form of $2500 per winner. The deadline to apply for the scholarship is August 1 for fall and November 1 for spring. In order to qualify for entry the students must fill out the application form, have a minimum G.P.A. of 3.5 and write and submit a 250 word essay detailing their career goals and financial needs. Applications for the scholarship can be found at the Lydia's Uniforms' and AACN's websites. Each semester, around 300 applications are received. The applications for the scholarship are carefully reviewed by the AACN and narrowed down to a group of finalists; the qualifications of the applicants are then checked. After deciding on a concrete group of finalists, the entries are sent on to Lydia’s Uniforms where a panel of judges chooses a winner. Winners are chosen based on the information provided in their essay.
