The Helene Fuld Health Trust is the largest charitable trust in the United States devoted exclusively to supporting student nurses and nursing education.  The trust — which began as a foundation in 1935, but transferred its assets to the trust in 1969 — has provided grants, scholarships, and financial aid for the education, health, and welfare of student nurses.[i]  The story of the Helene Fuld Health Trust has three parts: (i) the Estate of Helene Fuld, who died in 1923, (ii) the Helene Fuld Health Foundation, which ran from 1935 to 1969, and (iii) the creation of the Helene Fuld Health Trust in 1969. Helene Fuld, through probate proceedings following her death in 1923 (i.e., under the auspices of the Estate of Helene Fuld, Deceased), devised $91,718 to her two children.  Her husband (and father of her two children), Bernhard Fuld (1843–1918), had already died. Her children, Leonhard Felix Fuld (1883–1965) and Florentine Minnie Fuld (1878–1956), as devisees under her estate, shared the inheritance equally.  In 1935, Leonhard Felix Fuld, LLM, PhD,  and Florentine Minnie Fuld established the Helene Fuld Health Foundation, each contributing $5,000 in honor of their mother, Helene Fuld (née Helene Schwab; 1858–1923), who had been a health care advocate and education.  The Helene Fuld Health Foundation assets grew – from $4.8 million in 1952 to more than $35 million in 1965. In 1961, Fuld — desirous that the foundation continue after his death or incapacity — structured a succession plan that would eventually transfer the assets to a charitable trust named the Helene Fuld Health Trust. In 1950, the foundation's address was 8 Baldwin Avenue, Jersey City, New Jersey. Leonhard Fuld died in 1965.  Four years later, in 1969, the Foundation was dissolved according to Fuld's instructions, and the foundation assets – around $25 million – were transferred into the Helene Fuld Health Trust that had been created in 1950.  The trust, in 1969, was managed by Marine Midland Bank, of Buffalo, as sole trustee. Marine Midland, was acquired by HSBC Bank USA in 1980 and changed its name to HSBC Bank USA in 1999.  Leonhard Felix Fuld was born in Manhattan in 1883.  Growing up, Leonhard attended Public School 57 (on 115th Street, near Lexington), Public School 83, and for high school, the Horace Mann School (located first at 9 University Place in Greenwich Village, then, in his senior year in Morningside Heights at Teachers College. In higher education, he studied at Columbia University from about 1902 to 1909, earning five degrees: (i) a Bachelor of Arts in 1903 (completing his studies in just 1 year), (ii) a Master of Arts in 1904, (iii) a Bachelor of Laws in 1905, (iv) a Master of Laws in 1906, and (v) a PhD in Sociology and Political Economy (dissertation: "Police Administration," 1,100 pages) in 1909.    He went on to become an editor, an Examiner for the New York State Civil Service Commission and police security analyst, but his lifelong passion was public health and sanitation.  For much of Leonhard's life, he lived with his sister in Manhattan in a tenement at 130 East 110th Street, between Park and Lexington Avenues.  He lived much of his life as a recluse. Florentine Minnie Fuld was born in Manhattan in 1878.  She had been a primary school teacher.  Florentine Minnie Fuld died in 1956 of malnutrition at the Hospital for Joint Diseases, to which her brother had given money.  Before she died, she said that she had not left her house in 9 years. Leonhard Fuld died in 1965 at the Helene Fuld Hospital in Trenton, now known as the Capital Health Regional Medical Center.[ii]
