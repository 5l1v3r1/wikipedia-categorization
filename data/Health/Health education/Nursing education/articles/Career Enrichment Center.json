The AP version of physics requires calculus to accomplish the course goals, and therefore students are required to enter the course with Calculus I as either a prerequisite or co-requisite.  Physics is critical to certain careers in engineering, mathematics, science and technology.  The course meets science curriculum credit requirements for New Mexico high school graduation.</li>\n<li>Pre-Med and Advanced Pre-Medical Techniques - While medical school has a known reputation for being difficult both to enter and to complete, this curriculum gives capable students an excellent \"head start.\"  Human anatomy and physiology are studied in depth and detail, and all primary organs and systems of the human body are studied in this class.
