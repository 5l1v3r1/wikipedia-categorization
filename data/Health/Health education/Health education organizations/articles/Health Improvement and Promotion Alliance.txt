Health Improvement and Promotion Alliance (HIP-Ghana) is a nonprofit organization headquartered in Seattle, WA. Participants are from Ghana, the United States and Norway.  The organization's mission is to provide a nonprofit environment with low overhead for health action, and basic and applied social and health research in urban slums in Africa. This should lead to the betterment of the people in areas served. HIP-Ghana embraces the goals of research in support of community based change, and realize that health is a product of underlying social inequality, environmental degradation, and fundamental biologic processes. Several projects are underway in Nima-Maamobi - the poorest area of Accra, Ghana. People in Nima pursue multiple livelihoods strategies which are connected to migration. Thus, migration and migrants are crucial for understanding Nima's role in urban development and for making the appropriate and right recommendations for livelihoods development in Nima.
