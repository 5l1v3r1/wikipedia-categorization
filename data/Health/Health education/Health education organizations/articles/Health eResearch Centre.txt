The Health eResearch Centre  is a digital-health network directed by Prof. Iain Buchan that provides research and education across Northern England and beyond. Based at The University of Manchester and incorporating data-intensive health research from the universities of Bradford, Lancaster, Liverpool and York, the Health eResearch Centre (HeRC) has one principal aim: to improve public health and healthcare services through informatics research and digital health innovation.  The Centre delivers over 40 eHealth projects that aim to advance science's understanding of specific diseases alongside providing the methodological blueprints on how to conduct health data research.  Projects are grouped broadly into the following six themes: The Health eResearch Centre is one of four publicly funded eResearch centres of excellence that together make up The Farr Institute of Health Informatics Research. The network is also building capacity in health informatics research. The Farr Institute provides the physical and electronic infrastructure to facilitate collaboration across the four bodies, led from the universities of Dundee, Manchester, Swansea and UCL, and supports the safe use of research and patients' data for medical research.
