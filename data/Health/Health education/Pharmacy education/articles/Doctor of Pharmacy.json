This is the University of Benin, Benin City, Nigeria. The University of Benin commenced the program in 2001 following the approval given for the commencement of the program by the regulatory government agency for pharmacy education and practice in the country, Pharmacists Council of Nigeria (PCN). It was not until 2016 that the overall regulatory government agency for all university degree programs in the country, National Universities Commission (NUC), formally approved the PharmD degree program. The University of Benin PharmD is a six-year undergraduate program. On successful completion of the program, students are awarded both the Bachelor of Pharmacy (BPharm) degree and the PharmD. Prior to the commencement of the program, the university offered a five-year BPharm degree program which commenced in 1970. In the PharmD program, students are given extensive didactic preclinical/professional clinical preparation as well as clinical training (including pharmaceutical care) in different hospitals and community pharmacies. PCN and the national professional body of pharmacists, Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria (PSN), have envisaged that in the near future, PharmD degree will become the minimum educational qualification for the registration/licensing of fresh graduates of Nigeria's pharmacy schools for practice in the country. Through the efforts of the PCN, most pharmacy schools in Nigeria are now intensifying their preparations to commence the PharmD degree program.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"South_Africa\">South Africa</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Doctor_of_Pharmacy&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: South Africa\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Since 2006, Pharm.D is a post-graduate course being offered by <a href=\"/wiki/Rhodes_University\" title=\"Rhodes University\">Rhodes University</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Tunisia\">Tunisia</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Doctor_of_Pharmacy&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Tunisia\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The Pharm.D program has been available in Tunisia since 1975.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Asia\">Asia</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Doctor_of_Pharmacy&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Asia\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<table class=\"plainlinks metadata ambox mbox-small-left ambox-content\" role=\"presentation\"><tbody><tr><td class=\"mbox-image\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"[icon]\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png\" width=\"20\" height=\"14\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/30px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/40px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png 2x\" data-file-width=\"44\" data-file-height=\"31\" /></a></td><td class=\"mbox-text\"><div class=\"mbox-text-span\">This section <b>needs expansion</b>. <small>You can help by <a class=\"external text\" href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Doctor_of_Pharmacy&amp;action=edit&amp;section=\">adding to it</a>.</small>  <small><i>(June 2008)</i></small></div></td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Bangladesh\">Bangladesh</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Doctor_of_Pharmacy&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: Bangladesh\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>At present a five-year professional degree is offered in various public universities in Bangladesh.

On successful completion, Pharm.D. graduates can also pursue further education for Masters (MS/MPharm) and Ph.D. The Pharm.D. graduates from Gulf Medical University are well placed in practice, academia, and doing higher studies. The Program is undergoing International Certification by Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education, USA.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"North_America\">North America</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Doctor_of_Pharmacy&amp;action=edit&amp;section=35\" title=\"Edit section: North America\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Canada\">Canada</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Doctor_of_Pharmacy&amp;action=edit&amp;section=36\" title=\"Edit section: Canada\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Currently, in Canada, the <a href=\"/wiki/BPharm\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"BPharm\">BPharm</a> (and not <b>Pharm.D.</b>) is the minimum qualification required to practice pharmacy. In Canada the <b>Pharm.D.</b> program is offered in both <a href=\"/wiki/English_language\" title=\"English language\">English</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/French_language\" title=\"French language\">French</a>, and as a first professional degree as well as a postgraduate degree.  Students enrolled in the program must have graduated from a CCAPP (Canadian Council for Accreditation of Pharmacy Programs) or an <a href=\"/wiki/Accreditation_Council_for_Pharmacy_Education\" title=\"Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education\">ACPE</a> (Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education) school with an accredited teaching program or must have obtained a Certificate of Qualification from <a href=\"/wiki/Pharmacy_Examining_Board_of_Canada\" title=\"Pharmacy Examining Board of Canada\">PEBC</a>.\n</p><p>As of 2007, the Pharm.D. professional degree program in French is offered at the <a href=\"/wiki/Universit%C3%A9_de_Montr%C3%A9al\" title=\"Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al\">Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al</a> and, as of 2011, at the <a href=\"/wiki/Universit%C3%A9_Laval\" title=\"Universit\u00e9 Laval\">Universit\u00e9 Laval</a>. The <a href=\"/wiki/Universit%C3%A9_de_Montr%C3%A9al\" title=\"Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al\">Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al</a> was the first Canadian university to offer the Pharm.D. program as a first professional degree instead of the BPharm in pharmacy. In 2013, the <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_Alberta\" title=\"University of Alberta\">University of Alberta</a> would be offering a Pharm.D. as a post-professional degree, and a BPharm is required for admission into the program. The <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_Toronto\" title=\"University of Toronto\">University of Toronto</a> replaced their entry-level <a href=\"/wiki/BPharm\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"BPharm\">BPharm</a> curriculum with an entry-to-practice Pharm.D. curriculum in 2011, with approval being granted in 2013.\n</p><p>The Pharm.D. degree is also offered as a postgraduate degree at the <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_British_Columbia\" title=\"University of British Columbia\">University of British Columbia</a> and the University of Toronto. However, by the year 2020, most, if not all Canadian Pharmacy schools will have changed their Entry-To-Practice programs that awarded successful graduates with a Bachelor of Pharmaceutical Sciences to Entry-To-Practice Pharm.D. as the scope of practice for pharmacists continue to expand and change. Once this change is implemented, UBC will no longer have a separate 2-year Pharm.D. Program that is currently offered.\n</p><p>On January 23, 2013, the government of Ontario approved the University of Toronto and the <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_Waterloo\" title=\"University of Waterloo\">University of Waterloo</a> applications for the entry-to-practice Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.) program. Students graduating in 2015 will be the first cohort under this new undergraduate Pharm.D. program.\n</p><p>Dalhousie University (Halifax, Nova Scotia) is in progress of transitioning to the Pharm.D. program. Undergraduate applicants will require a minimum two years of prerequisite courses.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"United_States\">United States</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Doctor_of_Pharmacy&amp;action=edit&amp;section=37\" title=\"Edit section: United States\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Pharmacy is a health science and profession that melds chemistry, biology, anatomy, physiology, and other biomedical sciences together. The practice of pharmacy in the US is administered by an appropriately educated and licensed individual charged with ensuring the effective and safe use of drugs used throughout all aspects of patient care. In the <a href=\"/wiki/United_States\" title=\"United States\">United States</a>, the Doctor of <a href=\"/wiki/Pharmacy\" title=\"Pharmacy\">Pharmacy</a> (<b>Pharm.D.</b>) is a professional degree that offers opportunities in research, teaching, clinical practice, industry, manufacturing, judicial, and a multitude of other areas. The first Pharm.D. program in the USA was established at the <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_Southern_California\" title=\"University of Southern California\">University of Southern California</a> School of Pharmacy in <a href=\"/wiki/Los_Angeles\" title=\"Los Angeles\">Los Angeles</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/California\" title=\"California\">California</a> in 1950.\n</p><p>After completing the required prerequisites or obtaining a transferable bachelor's degree, pharmacy school is another four years. In general, the total collegiate timeline to become an entry level pharmacist is six to eight years; three to four years undergraduate prerequisite work/bachelor's degree then three (accelerated tract) to four years professional doctorate.\n</p><p>Acceptance to a Pharm.D. Program is competitive and laborious process.  Along with excellent natural science grades, most schools require students to take a pharmacy college admissions test<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> (PCAT) and complete 90 credit hours of university coursework in the sciences, mathematics, composition, and humanities before entry into the Pharm.D. program. Due to the extensive admission requirements and highly competitive nature of the field, many pharmacy students complete a bachelor's degree before entry to pharmacy school. Some institutions still offer six-year accelerated Pharm.D. programs (similar to six-year MD programs).\n</p><p>Residency is an option that is typically one to two years in length. Graduating candidates typically apply their final year of the Pharm.D. program. The accrediting body for most residency positions is the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists. Applications are submitted through the Pharmacy Online Residency Centralized Application Service; which opens 3 November each residency year. Residency sites interview candidates and a ranking occurs prior to a match process. \"The match\" is facilitated via the National Matching Services Inc. in conjunction with Pharmacy Online Residency Centralized Application Service website portal. A residency is useful; especially for new graduates who do not yet have adequate patient care experience or potentially seeking accelerated and additional experiential training.\n</p><p>An ACPE Accredited doctorate of pharmacy (Pharm.D.) is currently the only degree accepted by the <a href=\"/wiki/National_Association_of_Boards_of_Pharmacy\" title=\"National Association of Boards of Pharmacy\">National Association of Boards of Pharmacy</a> (NABP) to be eligible to \"sit\" for the <a href=\"/wiki/NAPLEX\" title=\"NAPLEX\">North American Pharmacist Licensure Examination</a> (NAPLEX). Previously, the United States had a five-year <a href=\"/wiki/Bachelor%27s_degree\" title=\"Bachelor&#39;s degree\">bachelor's degree</a> in pharmacy. For pharmacy graduates holding the <a href=\"/wiki/Bachelor_of_Science\" title=\"Bachelor of Science\">Bachelor of Science</a> degrees currently licensed in the United States wishing to attain the Pharm.D., there are programs available to bridge that gap. These programs are fully accredited by Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE), but they are only available to current B.S.Pharm. graduates with a license to practice pharmacy in the United States.\n</p><p>The current Pharm.D. degree curriculum is considerably different from that of the prior B.S. in pharmacy. It now includes extensive didactic clinical preparation,  hands-on clinical practice experience in a wider array of healthcare settings, and a greater emphasis on clinical pharmacy practice pertaining to pharmacotherapy optimization. Requirements in the US to becoming a <a href=\"/wiki/Pharmacist\" title=\"Pharmacist\">pharmacist</a> include graduating from a Doctor of Pharmacy from an ACPE accredited program, conducting a specified number of hours in internship under a licensed pharmacist (i.e. 1800 hours in some states), passing the NAPLEX, and passing a <a href=\"/wiki/Multistate_Pharmacy_Jurisprudence_Examination\" title=\"Multistate Pharmacy Jurisprudence Examination\">Multistate Pharmacy Jurisprudence Examination</a> (MPJE).\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"South_America\">South America</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Doctor_of_Pharmacy&amp;action=edit&amp;section=38\" title=\"Edit section: South America\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Brazil\">Brazil</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Doctor_of_Pharmacy&amp;action=edit&amp;section=39\" title=\"Edit section: Brazil\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In Brazil the title of pharmacist is awarded after completion of certified graduate studies; while the term Pharm.D. is not formally regulated it can be used and is commonly added to the graduate's professional license (issued by the regional pharmacy (Conselho Regional de Farmacia)).\n</p><p>Many Universities award sub-titles or co-titles including Biochemist and Industrial pharmacyst.
