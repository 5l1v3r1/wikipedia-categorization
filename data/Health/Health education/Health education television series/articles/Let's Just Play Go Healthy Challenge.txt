The Let's Just Play Go Healthy Challenge was a reality television series, which aired on Nickelodeon. Each season followed kids over a six-month period in the quest to make their lives healthier. The Let's Just Play Go Healthy Challenge is mostly supported by the network and The Alliance for a Healthier Generation, an initiative between the Clinton Foundation and the American Heart Association. Additionally, Nickelodeon and The Alliance for a Healthier Generations have formed the Go Healthy Challenge Champions Network, a group of organizations that are also supporting the show. They include the American Heart Association, American Diabetes Association, the National Association of Physical and Sports Education, National Recreation and Park Association, and the National Rural Health Association. They give support by helping to increase participation and awareness of the campaign. Kids can get information about the show and/or sign up to participate at the show's website. In addition, TurboNick will continue to air footage from participants' video diaries. The September 2006 issue of Nickelodeon Magazine featured three children who are working to improve health in their respective communities. The Worldwide Day of Play is a yearly event for kids and parents to go out and go play. When the six-month period ends in September, Nickelodeon airs the finale during the last Saturday of September, and title those days as, "Worldwide Day of Play". Nickelodeon goes off the air for 3 hours from 12 Noon to 3PM ET/PT on all Nick channels.
