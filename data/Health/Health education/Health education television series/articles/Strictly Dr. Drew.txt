Strictly Dr. Drew is a television show hosted by Loveline host Dr. Drew Pinsky. The format is very similar to Dr. Drew's previous show, "Strictly Sex with Dr. Drew," but deals with more general health issues rather than sexual ones.  Because the subject matter is less objectionable, the show is featured at an earlier airtime (10:00 PM ET) than "Strictly Sex" (Midnight ET), and features fewer "Viewer Discretion" warnings. It commonly features regular people (and sometimes celebrities) who have experienced whatever the topic may be, alongside experts on the subject, who give their professional opinion.
