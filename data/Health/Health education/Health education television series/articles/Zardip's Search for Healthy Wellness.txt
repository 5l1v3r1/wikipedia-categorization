Zardip's Search for Healthy Wellness was a Canadian educational television show from the 1980s intended to teach public health messages to schoolchildren. Zardip Pacific, played by Keram Malicki-SÃ¡nchez, is an alien from a planet whose inhabitants are becoming sick as they do not know how to live a healthy lifestyle.  He takes the form of a boy and ventures to Earth to report the habits of humans to his home planet. He befriends a group of teenagers, who instruct their new and ignorant friend on topics ranging from nutrition to exercise, all the while unaware of Zardip's true identity. The show has a cult following among Canadians who attended grade school in the late 1980s and early 1990s, due to memories of watching the videocassettes in class, or watching the shows as they aired on TVOntario.
