Health Education Systems Incorporated (HESI) is a United States company that provides exams and other study material to help prepare student nurses for their professional licensure exam. Schools often use HESI to help predict the student's likelihood of success in tests such as the NCLEX-RN.  Their Admission Assessment Exam are used as a baseline entrance criterion by some nursing schools. This exam is computerized and administered online in a four hour setting. HESI was acquired by Elsevier in 2006 to offer better services to the clients that they serve.   Many schools use the E2 exam to assess students preparedness for the NCLEX exam. E2 results also have a role in assessing the effectiveness of the school's curriculum and faculty.
