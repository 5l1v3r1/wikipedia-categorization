The Pharmacy College Admission Test (PCAT) is a computer-based standardized test administered to prospective pharmacy school students by Pearson Education, Inc offered in January, July, and September.  The test is divided into six sections to be taken in approximately four and a half hours.  The test includes Writing, Biology, Chemistry, Critical reading, and Quantitative Reasoning sections.  The composite score is based on the multiple-choice sections, and can range from 200 â€“ 600. There is no passing score; pharmacy schools set their own standards for acceptable scores. Calculators are not allowed during the testing period and no penalty is given for incorrect answers.
