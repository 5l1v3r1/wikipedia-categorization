The Test of Essential Academic Skills (TEAS Test) is a standardized, multiple choice exam for students applying for nursing school in the USA.  It is often used to determine the ability of potential students to adjust to a nursing program. The test is created and administered by Assessment Technologies Institute. On August 31, 2016, the TEAS V test was retired in favor of the newest version called ATI TEAS. While the difficulty is essentially the same, all components were updated to latest standards of the profession.  The exam is 209 minutes and consists of 170 questions, drawn from a TEAS Test Bank consisting of thousands of questions that are given on several versions of the exam. The topics covered are reading, mathematics, science, and English language and usage.
