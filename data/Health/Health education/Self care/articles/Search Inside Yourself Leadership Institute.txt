The Search Inside Yourself Leadership Institute (SIYLI) is a nonprofit organization that was started in 2013. SIYLI was founded by Chade-Meng Tan and Marc Lesser and is based on Chade-Meng Tan's book, Search Inside Yourself. SIYLI brings the Search Inside Yourself program, initially developed at Google, to other organizations and to the public. Search Inside Yourself is now a global program that bridges age-old practices of mind training with modern neuroscience and technology. The curriculum combines neuroscience, mindfulness and emotional intelligence. The first "Search Inside Yourself" two-day course was taught to Googlers in 2007. An estimated 1,500 Googlers are expected to go through the training in 2016, and the program has a long waiting list. In 2012, Tan and his team decided to make the course available to organizations and communities outside of Google. So the Search Inside Yourself Leadership Institute (SIYLI) was launched as a nonprofit, while Tanâ€™s book, Search Inside Yourself, became endorsed by the Dalai Lama and former President Jimmy Carter.
