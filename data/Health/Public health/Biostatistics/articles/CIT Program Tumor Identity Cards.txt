The "Cartes d'Identit√© des Tumeurs (CIT)" program, launched and financed by the French charity "Ligue Nationale contre le Cancer", aims at refining the molecular knowledge of multiple types of tumors with the prospect of improving or developing better targeted therapeutic approaches. The CIT program mainly relies on the large-scale and systematic profiling of large cohorts of tumors at various molecular levels including at least the genome, the epigenome, and the transcriptome.
