A facial mask is a creamy mask applied to clean or smooth the face. It often contains minerals, vitamins, and fruit extracts, such as cactus and cucumber. There are different kinds of masks for different purposes; some are deep cleansing for cleaning the pores. The perceived effect of a facial mask treatment can be revitalizing, rejuvenating or refreshing.  Facial masks are most commonly used by women but are also used by men. Some masks are washed off with tepid water, others are peeled off by hand. Duration for wearing a mask depends on type of mask, but can be three minutes to 30 minutes, and sometimes the whole night. Honey is a very popular mask because it smooths skin, and cleans pores. A popular home remedy includes a slice of cucumber on the eyes.  Some also use pickle juice.  Facial masks should be selected according to skin type. Clay and mud masks suit oily skin; cream-based masks work best on dry skin types. Masks should be used after cleansing for better results. Firming masks should not be applied on the eye area because they can cause itching.
