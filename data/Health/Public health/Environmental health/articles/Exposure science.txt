Exposure science is  the study of an organism's (usually human) contact with chemical, physical, biological agents or other health risk (e.g. accidental) occurring in their environments, and advances knowledge of the mechanisms and dynamics of events either causing or preventing adverse health outcomes.  Exposure science plays a fundamental role in the development and application of epidemiology, toxicology, and risk assessment. It provides critical information for protecting human and ecosystem health. Exposure science also has the ability to play an effective role in other fields, including environmental regulation, urban, traffic safety  and ecosystem planning, and disaster management; in many cases these are untapped opportunities. Exposure science links human and ecologic behavior to environmental processes in such a way that the information generated can be used to mitigate or prevent future adverse exposures.
