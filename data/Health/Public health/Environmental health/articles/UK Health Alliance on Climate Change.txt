The UK Health Alliance on Climate Change (UKHACC) is a coalition of health institutions that work together to combat climate change. It was formed in 2016 to lead the health profession’s response to climate change in the United Kingdom. The Alliance brings together doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals to advocate for better responses to climate change that protect and promote public health.  UKHACC emphasises the health co-benefits of tackling climate change, and raises awareness about the relationship between health and climate change.  The Alliance has campaigned on air pollution  and coal phase-out.  On 30 March 2017, UKHACC highlighted in a letter to the Health Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, that “more work is urgently needed to prepare the personnel, the systems and the facilities of the NHS, as well as other institutions involved in health care, for the implications of climate change.”    On the topic of coal, the Alliance has noted that coal, as a driver of climate change, damages human health indirectly by increasing the frequency and severity of extreme weather events like floods and heatwaves.  Members of the UK Health Alliance on Climate Change include royal colleges, medical journals, faculties and societies.
