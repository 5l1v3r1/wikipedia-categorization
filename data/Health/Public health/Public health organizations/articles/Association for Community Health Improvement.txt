The Association for Community Health Improvement (ACHI) is a professional organization for community health, community benefit, healthy communities and public health, founded in 2002.  It is an affiliate of the American Hospital Association. The Association's mission is to convene and support leaders from the health care, public health, community and philanthropic sectors to help achieve shared community health goals, and work with members to strengthen community health through education, peer networking, and the dissemination of practical tools. ACHI serves members' needs in a number of focus areas within community health, including: The Association offers educational webinars, an annual conference, online career center, community health assessment tool, and professional networking opportunities. The Association for Community Health Improvement was conceived in 2002 as a successor to three national community health initiatives: the Community Care Network Demonstration Program, ACT National Outcomes Network, and Coalition for Healthier Cities and Communities. These three programs had made contributions to community health since the mid-1990s, focusing on topics including health care delivery and preventive health systems, careful planning for and measurement of progress toward defined community health goals, and broad community engagement in resolving systemic challenges to community health and social well-being. ACHI has over 700 members from 47 states, the District of Columbia, and Canada.
