As the U.S. federal, state, and local public health systems continued to expand, NACHO combined with the U.S. Conference of Local Health Officers, an organization affiliated with the United States Conference of Mayors, to form the National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO) in 1994. This unified organization more closely represents all\ngovernmental local health departments, including <a href=\"/wiki/County_(United_States)\" title=\"County (United States)\">counties</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Cities\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cities\">cities</a>, city/counties, <a href=\"/wiki/Districts\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Districts\">districts</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Townships\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Townships\">townships</a>. In 2001, NACCHO expanded its scope to include tribal public health agencies serving tribal communities on reservation lands and in 2012 to include counties and cities in the U.S. territories. Today, active membership in NACCHO continues to grow with about 1,500 local health departments.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Governance\">Governance</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=National_Association_of_County_and_City_Health_Officials&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Governance\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>NACCHO is governed by a 27-member <a href=\"/wiki/Board_of_Directors\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Board of Directors\">Board of Directors</a> composed of health officials from around the country elected by their peers, a representative for Tribal health departments, and <i>ex officio</i> members representing the National Association of Counties, of which NACCHO is an affiliate, and the <a href=\"/wiki/U.S._Conference_of_Mayors\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"U.S. Conference of Mayors\">U.S. Conference of Mayors</a>.
