initiative establishing and managing 350 Care &amp; Support Centres (CSCs) across India to expand access to essential services, increase treatment adherence, reduce stigma and discrimination, and improve the quality of life of people living with HIV (PLHIV). The programme is designed as the care &amp; support component of the country\u2019s HIV response under National AIDS Control Programme IV (NACP IV).<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> Working in collaboration with the Department of AIDS Control<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> and with support from the <a href=\"/wiki/Global_Fund\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Global Fund\">Global Fund</a>, the programme operates in 31 states and territories and will reach more than one million PLHIV by 2016. The Vihaan consortium is led by Alliance India and 17 state-level PLHIV networks and NGOs that in turn partner with district-level PLHIV networks and other organisations to deliver care &amp; support services in communities. Vihaan provides access to a range of quality care &amp; support services using an integrated approach that complements existing <a href=\"/wiki/HIV_prevention\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"HIV prevention\">HIV prevention</a> and treatment programming. Working in coordination with nearby <a href=\"/wiki/Management_of_HIV/AIDS\" title=\"Management of HIV/AIDS\">ART</a> Centres, CSCs serve as safe spaces for PLHIV offering services that include counselling, outreach and follow-up support, health referrals, and linkages to social welfare schemes.\n</p><p><b>Pehchan</b>\n</p><p>Named for the Hindi word meaning \u2018identity,\u2019 \u2018recognition\u2019 or \u2018acknowledgement,\u2019 the Pehchan programme strengthens and builds the capacity of 200 community-based organisations (CBOs) to provide effective, inclusive and sustainable HIV prevention programming in 17 states in India for more than 450,000 men who have sex with men (MSM), transgender people and hijras (collectively, MTH). Pehchan is funded by the Global Fund and remains their largest single-country grant to date focused on the HIV response for vulnerable and underserved <a href=\"/wiki/Sexual_minorities\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sexual minorities\">sexual minorities</a>. Along with Alliance India, the Pehchan consortium includes the <a href=\"/wiki/Humsafar_Trust\" title=\"Humsafar Trust\">Humsafar Trust</a>, Pehchan North Region Office, SAATHII, Sangama, Alliance India Andhra Pradesh, and SIAAP. Pehchan is a rare example of a Community Systems Strengthening programme working at a national scale. It provides organisational development, technical and capacity building support to new and existing CBOs working with MTH communities. Using a rights-based approach, the programme develops CBOs to serve as implementing partners with the National AIDS Control Programme\u2019s Targeted Interventions (TIs) that provide HIV prevention services to high-risk groups. By helping build strong CBOs, Pehchan addresses capacity gaps that often prevent them from receiving government funding. Pehchan also enhances the scope of services to reflect the needs of the community. The programme leverages and complements the government\u2019s HIV prevention strategy for MTH by providing services beyond basic HIV prevention that support an enabling environment that encourages healthy behaviours. Pehchan also fosters community-friendly services in the broader health system and engages in advocacy to improve the lives and wellbeing of MTH populations in India.\n</p><p><b>Hridaya</b>\n</p><p>Named for the Hindi word for \u2018heart,\u2019 the Hridaya programme expands <a href=\"/wiki/Harm_reduction\" title=\"Harm reduction\">harm reduction</a> services for people who inject drugs (PWID), their partners and families and fosters an enabling environment by protecting and promoting their rights. The programme leverages the existing government investment in HIV prevention for PWID and builds <a href=\"/wiki/NGO\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"NGO\">NGO</a> capacity to expand services to include a full range of harm reduction interventions. Hridaya is funded by the <a href=\"/wiki/Government_of_Netherlands\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Government of Netherlands\">Government of Netherlands</a> and is part of the five-country Community Action on Harm Reduction<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> initiative. The programme in India complements and supplements the services of Targeted Interventions (TIs) in selected states. TIs are at the centre of the HIV prevention approach for PWID adopted by the Department of AIDS Control and implemented by State AIDS Control Societies (SACS) around the country. Hridaya works in partnership with 34 organisations to augment existing capacity and fill implementation gaps in harm reduction in the states of <a href=\"/wiki/Bihar\" title=\"Bihar\">Bihar</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Haryana\" title=\"Haryana\">Haryana</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Uttarakhand\" title=\"Uttarakhand\">Uttarakhand</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Jammu\" title=\"Jammu\">Jammu</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Manipur\" title=\"Manipur\">Manipur</a>. By the end of 2014, the programme will reach more than 50,000 beneficiaries, including more than 10,000 PWID.\n</p><p><b>Koshish</b>\n</p><p>Named for the Hindi word for \u2018effort,\u2019 the Koshish programme supported advocacy and action to improve sexual &amp; reproductive health (SRH) of people living with HIV (PLHIV) and key populations in India. Funded by the <a href=\"/wiki/European_Union\" title=\"European Union\">European Union</a>, the programme strengthened civil society organisations and networks that represent and work with PLHIV and other marginalised groups, such as female sex workers (FSWs), men who have sex with men (MSM), transgender people, hijras and people who inject drugs (PWID). Through coalitions, Koshish partner organisations worked at state and district levels, affirming principles of empowerment and meaningful partnership as core elements of effective advocacy. The programme was successful in advancing community-led advocacy initiatives that raised awareness of SRH challenges faced by PLHIV. Community priorities were then taken up by state-level advocacy coalitions established by Koshish and composed of civil society organisations, PLHIV networks, community-based organisations working for and led by key populations, and media. Koshish successfully advocated for appropriate interventions to address critical challenges facing PLHIV, including <a href=\"/wiki/Social_stigma\" title=\"Social stigma\">social stigma</a> and discrimination, limited accessibility to and availability of essential SRH services, and lack of a comprehensive approach to the SRH needs of PLHIV, particularly of women living with HIV (WLHIV). For instance, the programme increased access for WLHIV in the four programme states to <a href=\"/wiki/Pap_smear\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Pap smear\">Pap smear</a> testing. WLHIV are five-times more susceptible to <a href=\"/wiki/Cervical_cancer\" title=\"Cervical cancer\">cervical cancer</a> than other women. Alliance India implemented Koshish in partnership with CHETNA, MAMTA, PWDS and VMM, along with state-level PLHIV networks in <a href=\"/wiki/Andhra_Pradesh\" title=\"Andhra Pradesh\">Andhra Pradesh</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Gujarat\" title=\"Gujarat\">Gujarat</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Maharashtra\" title=\"Maharashtra\">Maharashtra</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Tamil_Nadu\" title=\"Tamil Nadu\">Tamil Nadu</a>.\n</p><p><b>Abhaya</b>\n</p><p>Female sex workers (FSWs) have considerable unmet sexual &amp; reproductive health (SRH) needs due to their occupations and social marginalization.\nThey are discouraged from accessing SRH services due to stigma and discrimination, negative attitudes of healthcare providers, and fear of clients, law enforcement, and people opposed to sex work. Evidence, both global and national, has shown that linking HIV and SRH services provide a valuable impetus to encourage uptake of prevention, treatment, and care and support services, especially by people living with HIV (PLHIV) and key populations, including FSWs. With this approach in mind, Alliance India with funding support from <a href=\"/wiki/MAC_AIDS_Fund\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"MAC AIDS Fund\">MAC AIDS Fund</a> has initiated a pilot programme Abhaya \u2013 meaning \u2018fearless woman\u2019 in Hindi \u2013 for FSWs in Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat. Abhaya expands access to complementary SRH services, including basic information, counselling, referrals and linkages to facilities providing required services. In addition, Abhaya builds the capacity of healthcare providers to address the specific needs of FSWs. Abhaya also engages in advocacy with the government to identify opportunities to adapt and scale up expanded access to SRH services for FSWs. Abhaya gives a significant role to FSWs in the implementation of the programme at all stages to increase ownership and the potential for sustainability of the initiative. Over the first two pilot years, the programme will reach 4,500 FSWs and their partners, helping them better identify their SRH needs and access quality services thus empowering them to protect their overall health and well-being.\n</p><p><b>Asia Action on Harm Reduction</b>\n</p><p>Worldwide an estimated 16 million people inject drugs, and three million of them are living with HIV. In India, HIV prevalence in this group is 24-times that of the general population. Though progress has been made, the HIV epidemic continues to be fuelled by stigma, discrimination often experienced by the community together with the laws, policies and practices that impose harsh penalties on people who use drugs. With funding from European Union, the Asia Action on Harm Reduction (AAHR) programme supports advocacy to increase access by people who inject drugs (PWID) to comprehensive harm reduction services and reduce stigma, discrimination and abuse towards this vulnerable population. AAHR is working towards improving national policy environments for more evidence-based and rights-based responses to drug use and HIV/AIDS in six countries in <a href=\"/wiki/Asia\" title=\"Asia\">Asia</a> \u2013 <a href=\"/wiki/China\" title=\"China\">China</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Cambodia\" title=\"Cambodia\">Cambodia</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Vietnam\" title=\"Vietnam\">Vietnam</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Malaysia\" title=\"Malaysia\">Malaysia</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Indonesia\" title=\"Indonesia\">Indonesia</a> and India. In India, AAHR engages with PWID and partners in Bihar, Haryana, Uttarakhand and Manipur.\n</p><p><b>Chanura Kol</b>\n</p><p>Often neglected, women who inject drugs are a highly marginalised and vulnerable population in need of a comprehensive response to meet their health and social needs. With support from the <a href=\"/wiki/Elton_John_AIDS_Foundation\" title=\"Elton John AIDS Foundation\">Elton John AIDS Foundation</a>, Alliance India partnered with Social Awareness Social Organisation to mitigate the impact of drug use and HIV on these women through the Chanura Kol project \u2013 named with the Manipuri words for \u2018garden of women.\u2019 Through a holistic, community-based model, Chanura Kol met immediate health, protection and psychosocial needs of women who inject drugs. In addition the project enhanced access to harm reduction services, supported economic rehabilitation and social integration, and reduced stigma and discrimination related to both injecting drug use and HIV. Drop-in centres and a short-stay home were established to provide harm reduction services, HIV prevention interventions, care &amp; support programming, and counselling. Support groups were also formed in each district, providing outreach and referrals to sexual &amp; reproductive health (SRH), <a href=\"/wiki/Antiretroviral_therapy\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Antiretroviral therapy\">antiretroviral therapy</a> (ART), <a href=\"/wiki/ICTC\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"ICTC\">ICTC</a>, general health and other social services. Referrals were also provided for drug treatment and oral substitution therapy (OST). Once women completed treatment or stabilised on OST, they could access the short-stay home for six months; the home provided shelter, food, health services, psychosocial and family reintegration support, and vocational training.\n</p><p><b>Avahan </b>\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Avahan\" title=\"Avahan\">Avahan</a> India <a href=\"/wiki/AIDS\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"AIDS\">AIDS</a> Initiative was a focused prevention initiative funded by the <a href=\"/wiki/Bill_%26_Melinda_Gates_Foundation\" title=\"Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation\">Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation</a> that worked in six states of India to reduce HIV transmission and lower the prevalence of <a href=\"/wiki/Sexually_transmitted_infections\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sexually transmitted infections\">sexually transmitted infections</a> in vulnerable high-risk populations \u2013 female sex workers (FSWs), men who have sex with men (MSM), transgender people, people who inject drugs (PWID) \u2013 through prevention education and services. Alliance India was designated a state lead partner for Avahan in Andhra Pradesh (AP). The programme\u2019s main components included <a href=\"/wiki/Condom\" title=\"Condom\">condom</a> promotion, STI management, behaviour change communication, community mobilisation, and advocacy. Avahan also supported the creation of an enabling environment through individual and organisational capacity building to increase the effectiveness and impact of the HIV response. Alliance India\u2019s efforts in Andhra Pradesh strengthened the capacity of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and community-based organisation (CBOs) to implement quality HIV and STI programming in close partnership with the AP State AIDS Control Society (APSACS)<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> and in alignment with the National AIDS Control Programme IV (NACP IV). Reaching more than 85,000 FSWs, MSM and transgender people, the programme contributed significantly to HIV prevention among high-risk population in Andhra Pradesh. Health-seeking behaviour in these groups increased from 5% to 70% in the first five years of the programme. Condom distribution increased from 6.5 million to 102 million in six years. An estimated 10,000 HIV infections were averted among target populations in the 13 intervention districts in the <a href=\"/wiki/Telangana\" title=\"Telangana\">Telangana</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Rayalseema\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Rayalseema\">Rayalseema</a> regions, and more than 450,000 people were reached through prevention campaigns and public events.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Past_Programmes\">Past Programmes</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=India_HIV/AIDS_Alliance&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Past Programmes\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Action_Project\">Action Project</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=India_HIV/AIDS_Alliance&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Action Project\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In a region where taboos prevent open discussions about sex, the Action Project opened up spaces for such conversations among young people in India and <a href=\"/wiki/Bangladesh\" title=\"Bangladesh\">Bangladesh</a>. Funded by the <a href=\"/wiki/European_Union\" title=\"European Union\">European Union</a>, the project supported community mobilisation and advocacy to improve sexual &amp; reproductive health (SRH) of young people. Using a right-based approach, the project focused particularly on the most marginalised young people \u2013 men who have sex with men (MSM), transgender people, people who inject drugs (PWID), female sex workers (FSWs), and people living with HIV (PLHIV). Peer-led discussions strengthened and empowered civil society organisations and <a href=\"/wiki/Youth\" title=\"Youth\">youth</a> groups to advocate for more responsive policies addressing the SRH of young people. The Action Project was implemented in India by Alliance India in the states of <a href=\"/wiki/Manipur\" title=\"Manipur\">Manipur</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Uttar_Pradesh\" title=\"Uttar Pradesh\">Uttar Pradesh</a> in partnership with SASO and MAMTA and in Bangladesh by HASAB. One of the key strategies employed by the project was the development of Youth Partnership Platforms (YPPs) to link youth group networks together at various levels to advocate for the inclusion of young people and their issues in national and state-level SRH policy and programme development. In addition, the establishment of Youth Information Centres at village level increased SRH and HIV knowledge among participating youth and expanded their capacity to share this information with their peers and in the wider community.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"CHAHA\">CHAHA</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=India_HIV/AIDS_Alliance&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: CHAHA\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Named for the Hindi word for \u2018wish,\u2019 CHAHA was India\u2019s first large-scale care &amp; support programme for children, families and communities affected by HIV/AIDS.
