The Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco (SRNT) is an international organization that studies and shares research on nicotine and tobacco use from a public health and scientific perspective. It is the largest organization focused on nicotine and tobacco, with members in 40 countries. SRNTâ€™s work has been used by the World Health Organization and governments in setting policies on topics such as tobacco advertising, taxation, smoke-free laws, and smoking cessation. SRNT has been particularly active in work on the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control and the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement in the US. SRNT is a nonprofit organization and publishes the scientific journal Nicotine and Tobacco Research. SRNT does not accept funding from the tobacco industry. The organization does accept funding from pharmaceutical companies that make medications to help people quit smoking. SRNT was founded in 1994.  Work from SRNT members was noted in public discussion leading up to the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act in the US  and SRNT is cited as an expert source in the Act.  The society and its members have also been involved in the current debate on tobacco harm reduction,  the safety and prevalence of e-cigarettes,  and other public health issues.
