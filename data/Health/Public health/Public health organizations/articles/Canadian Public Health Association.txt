The Canadian Public Health Association (CPHA) is a national non-profit organization dedicated to public health. The association was founded in 1910 by the editors of the Public Health Journal, which became the Canadian Public Health Journal under the auspices of the new organization. CPHA's objective was to establish professional standards for the field of public health and to advance research in the area. Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn was named as the patron of the new organization, and its first president was T.A. Starkey of McGill University. CPHA received a federal charter in 1912.  The organization celebrated its centenary in 2010.  The Association journal was later called the Canadian Journal of Public Health.
