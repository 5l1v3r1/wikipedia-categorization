By 1980, WIC had expanded to over 55 projects, including the Stateâ€™s two major urban locations Milwaukee and Madison. By 1990, the majority of the current WIC Program was in place. [not in citation given]  Divided into 5 regions and WIC services were being provided in nearly every county of Wisconsin.  As WIC expanded, it became increasingly more difficult to maintain contact and communication with the numerous WIC projects throughout the state. Recognizing that, on June 30, 1998 a group of like-minded individuals met together resulting in the formation of Wisconsin WIC Association (WWA). The WWA organizes meetings and projects by WIC employees, politicians, and community members to encourage funding, grant dispersal, and educational programs related to the WIC.
