The Public Health Agency of Canada (French: Agence de la santé publique du Canada) is an agency of the Government of Canada that is responsible for public health, emergency preparedness, and response and infectious and chronic disease control and prevention.  It was formed by Order in Council in 2004 and subsequently by legislation that came into force December 15, 2006 and it is member of the Federal Health Portfolio (along with Health Canada, the Canadian Institute of Health Research, and other organizations). The head of the Public Health Agency is the Chief Public Health Officer of Canada. The current Chief is Dr. Theresa Tam.  As the Deputy Minister responsible for the Public Health Agency of Canada, the Chief Public Health Officer reports to the Minister of Health.  As the Federal Government's lead public health official, the Chief Public Health Officer provides advice to the Minister of Health and the Government of Canada on issues concerning the health of Canadians. Its headquarters are located in two pillars—one is in Ottawa, the other is the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg, Manitoba, the location of Canada's only Level 4 microbiology lab for human health.  At the time of its creation in 1998, most of the agency's staff were located in the former Gandalf Technologies building in Nepean, south of Ottawa, and were part of Health Canada's Population and Public Health Branch.
