The role of the health sector must move increasingly in a health promotion direction, beyond its responsibility for providing clinical and curative services. Health services need to embrace an expanded mandate which is sensitive and respects cultural needs. This mandate should support the needs of individuals and communities for a healthier life, and open channels between the health sector and broader social, political, economic and physical environmental components.\n</p><p>Reorienting health services also requires stronger attention to health research as well as changes in professional education and training. This must lead to a change of attitude and organization of health services which refocuses on the total needs of the individual as a whole person. (Ottawa Charter, WHO 1986)\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Accordingly, HPHs aim at improving the health gain of hospitals (and other health services) by a bundle of strategies targeting\n</p>\n<ul><li>patients</li>\n<li>staff and</li>\n<li>the community</li></ul>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Short_history_of_HPH\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Short history of HPH</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#HPH:_The_concept\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">HPH: The concept</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#HPH_structure\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">HPH structure</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Short_history_of_HPH\">Short history of HPH</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Health_promoting_hospitals&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Short history of HPH\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Based on the <a href=\"/wiki/Ottawa_Charter\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Ottawa Charter\">Ottawa Charter</a>, the first conceptual developments on HPH started in 1988. A first model project <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.hph-hc.cc/projects.php#hah\">\"Health and Hospital\"</a>, was initiated in 1989 at the Rudolfstiftung Hospital in Vienna, Austria, and successfully finished in 1996. <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.univie.ac.at/lbimgs/projekte/publ1.html\">10 model documents</a> (in German language) summarise the learnings from the pilot project and are available online to guide hospital projects related to health promotion.\n</p><p>In 1990, the <b>WHO International Network of Health Promoting Hospitals</b> was founded as a multi city action plan of the <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.euro.who.int/healthy-cities\">WHO Healthy Cities Network</a>. In 1991, the HPH network, which was in the beginning an alliance of experts, launched its first policy document, the <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.euro.who.int/document/IHB/hphbudadecl.pdf\">Budapest Declaration on Health Promoting Hospitals</a>. This document introduces the HPH concept and target groups - patients, staff, community - as well as related HPH strategies and action areas.\n</p><p>In order to implement HPH on a broader basis, a <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.hph-hc.cc/projects.php#hph\">European Pilot Hospital Project</a> of Health Promoting Hospitals was initiated in 1993, and finished in 1997. 20 hospitals from 11 European countries participated, 19 of which finished the project successfully. \nAlso in 1993, the first <br /><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.hph-hc.cc/conferences.php\">international HPH conference</a> was organised, and the first <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.hph-hc.cc/newsletter.php\">international HPH Newsletter</a> was published.\n</p><p>Since 1995, national and regional networks of HPH, all coordinated by their own national or regional coordinating centres, are being implemented and developed in order to disseminate HPH to as many hospitals and health care institutions as possible. The development of the HPH networks called for a new policy document: The <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.euro.who.int/document/IHB/hphviennarecom.pdf\">Vienna Recommendations on Health Promoting Hospitals</a> were launched in 1997.\n</p><p>In 2009, HPH has become a global movement with national and regional networks, individual member hospitals and health promotion initiatives on all continents.

This needs to be supported by evaluation and monitoring, professional training and education, research and dissemination. \n</p><p>One way to implement HPH in a hospital or other health care organisation is by linking HPH aims and targets with <a href=\"/wiki/Quality_management\" title=\"Quality management\">quality management</a>, thus understanding <a href=\"/wiki/Health_promotion\" title=\"Health promotion\">health promotion</a> as one specific quality aspect in hospitals and health care. Ideally any managerial or professional decision in an HPH should also consider the health / disease impact of that decision, together with other decision criteria (e.g. effectiveness, sustainability).\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"HPH_structure\">HPH structure</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Health_promoting_hospitals&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: HPH structure\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The international HPH Network was initiated by and is affiliated to <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.euro.who.int/healthpromohosp/\">WHO-Euro</a>.\nIt is governed by a steering committee which is composed of elected national / regional network coordinators and representatives of WHO and <a href=\"/wiki/WHO_Collaborating_Centres\" title=\"WHO Collaborating Centres\">WHO Collaborating Centres</a> who support the network internationally:\n</p><p>The <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.hphnet.org\">WHO Collaborating Centre on Evidence Based Health Promotion in Hospitals</a>, Copenhagen, Denmark, runs the International HPH Network secretariat and is responsible for managing and growing membership as well as developing and implementing the internal and external communications strategy.\nThe <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.hph-hc.cc\">WHO Collaborating Centre on Health Promotion in Hospitals and Health Care</a>, Vienna, Austria, is amongst others responsible for the scientific preparation of the annual international HPH conferences and for the scientific editing of the semi-annual <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.hph-hc.cc/newsletter.php\">HPH Newsletter</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Health_promoting_hospitals&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Groene O, Garcia-Barbero M (ed).
