To adequately assess peoples\u2019 access to these basic services it is vital that there is accessible, accurate and reliable data that is routinely collected and updated.\n</p><p>A variety of tools and techniques have been developed in recent years to collect such information. However, unless data is easily accessible and is presented in a user-friendly format, decision makers commonly do without the information. One alternative that has been designed to manage large volumes of data and to enable a user-friendly presentation is to use geo-referenced datasets, which provide a means of integration of data from different sources at any point on the globe.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Henninger_1998_1-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Henninger_1998-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> Within such a framework, for any specific point on the map (identified by its grid reference) detailed and accurate data of different nature can be linked in an integrated way. Mapping therefore involves the presentation of certain information in a spatial context, and this enables policy planners to identify the geographic areas and communities in which to focus their efforts for maximum impact. In all, mapping presents many benefits, such as:\n</p>\n<ul><li>It makes easier to integrate data from different sources (surveys, censuses, satellites, etc.) and from different disciplines (social, economic, and environmental data). It also allows the switch to new units of analysis from, for example, administrative boundaries (e.g. state) to ecological boundaries (e.g. basin).</li>\n<li>Maps are a powerful visual tool and are more easily understood by stakeholders, particularly in developing countries.</li>\n<li>The spatial nature of water poverty, such as the distance to the nearest water source or the water supply infrastructure, can also be incorporated easily in a GIS database.</li>\n<li>The allocation of resources can be improved, since geographic targeting is more efficient and cost-effective than to launch an equally expensive universal distribution programme.</li>\n<li>Geo-referenced databases can be enriched by additional data as they become available; and new attributes, such as better details on water quality, can be incorporated into the data structure, ensuring that the relevance of the data is sustained over time.</li>\n<li>Maps can be produced at a number of different resolutions depending on their purpose and the cost of data collection. A coarse resolution or a scale too small neglects the heterogeneity within each unit and provides insufficient detail for decision making, while a fine resolution or a scale too large increases the cost of compiling, managing, and analyzing the data.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Methodology\">Methodology</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Water_point_mapping&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Methodology\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Water Point Mapping (WPM) can be defined as an \u2018exercise whereby the geographical positions of all improved water points in an area are gathered in addition to management, technical and demographical information\u2019.<sup id=\"cite_ref-WaterAid_and_ODI_2005_2-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-WaterAid_and_ODI_2005-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> A handheld Global Positioning System (GPS) unit is used to record the precise location and approximate altitude of all water points audited; a digital camera is used to capture photographs of each water point in order to show the status and physical conditions; and a structured questionnaire is completed to document main characteristics, such as: location, functionality, category of water supply, water quality perception, management issues, ownership and water tariff payment. All collected data is entered into a geographical information system and correlated with available demographic, administrative, and physical data. The information is finally displayed using digital maps.\n</p><p>WPM seeks to serve two different purposes:\n</p>\n<ul><li>To easily show the distribution of water points in a territory.

Clearly, the core sector indicator is water supply coverage, and in rural areas, access to water is normally defined by establishing a ratio of the maximum distance and number of people served by each water point. Three different possibilities exist when defining access:\n</p>\n<ol><li>Calculate coverage as the standard number of people served per water point (normally defined in the water policy) multiplied by the number of water points, regardless of distance from dwellings to the water point.</li>\n<li>Calculate coverage by considering the people served by water point as the number of people living at a certain distance from it, regardless the maximum number of people to be served by a water point as defined in the corresponding water policy.</li>\n<li>A case-specific approach combining both of the above conditions and applying the most restrictive one in each scenario.</li></ol>\n<p>In order to accurately assess the number of people served using distance as a criterion (no. 2) the spatial distribution of population is required, and this is problematic in the majority of cases. Despite the progress made with satellite free access images, many rural areas are still not covered with sufficient precision. On the other hand, due to periodic sociological census undertaken in nearly all countries, population distribution in administrative structures is usually quite well documented. Thus, first abovementioned criterion is the most commonly used.\n</p><p>With this information, the percentage of access to water in an area is estimated, and first indicator of access can be defined as Improved Community Water Point Density (ICWPD), which is equal to the number of ICWP per 1,000 inhabitants. A certain area would have access if its density of water points per 1,000 inhabitants is above the national threshold, and percentage of people not served in an area would be proportional to the lack of water points available compared to that threshold. However, to further improve ICWP indicator is simple since information on functionality for each water point is also collected during the survey. Non-functionality is an important obstacle to access to rural water supply, and in sub-Saharan Africa averages around 35%.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Harvey_and_Reed_2007_10-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Harvey_and_Reed_2007-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> Consequently, Functional Community Water Point Density (FCWPD) can be used as more accurate access indicator.

However and in much the same way as with water supply, care is needed to define an acceptable form of excreta disposal. A wide range of technologies is used, particularly for settings where low-cost solutions are required, and relevant research conducted elsewhere concluded that all types of facility can be operated hygienically. As a result, sanitation technologies are considered as providing adequate access to sanitation as long as they are private (but not shared / public) and hygienically separate human faeces from human contact.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Joint_Monitoring_Programme_2010_4-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Joint_Monitoring_Programme_2010-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> Likewise, the addition of hygiene education is required to see health impacts materialize, in particular the basic issues of <a href=\"/wiki/Hand_washing\" title=\"Hand washing\">hand washing</a>, proper disposal of faeces, and protection of drinking water.

The drawback of the WPM approach, however, is that the focus is on water points, while sanitation and hygiene data need to be collected at the household. An approach for WASH data collection that combines a water points mapping with a household-based survey might overcome previous constraint. The new methodology takes the WPM as a starting point to comprehensively record all improved water points, being the water point basic sampling unit. This information can be then combined with data provided from a household survey to assess sanitation and hygienic habits. In terms of method, the approach adopted includes: (i) identification and audit of all improved water points; (ii) calculation of a sample size of households that is representative at and below the district level; and (iii) random household selection at the water point.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Gin\u00e9_et_al_2010_11-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Gin\u00e9_et_al_2010-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Applications\">Applications</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Water_point_mapping&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Applications\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>WPM can be used to support different types of analysis, and specific applications include among others broad strategic planning, priority setting exercises and performance monitoring.<sup id=\"cite_ref-MacDonald_et_al_2009_12-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-MacDonald_et_al_2009-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> Potential users of WPM outcomes include organizations that have water poverty alleviation as their mandate, for example, at the international level, UN agencies, the <a href=\"/wiki/World_Bank\" title=\"World Bank\">World Bank</a>, bilateral development agencies and international NGOs.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Planning_at_local_level\">Planning at local level</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Water_point_mapping&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Planning at local level\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Maps have come out a powerful tool for identifying and targeting the most deprived population, and therefore support poverty reduction initiatives.

The priority document was approved and issued in September 2009 by the District Authority, and it was also used to set the priorities for all sector-related stakeholders operating within the district.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Analysis_of_functionality_of_water_points\">Analysis of functionality of water points</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Water_point_mapping&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: Analysis of functionality of water points\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>WPM data can be used to analyze the durability of water points depending on different factors such as time after construction, technology, management framework, or the approach adopted in the implementation.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Jim\u00e9nez_and_P\u00e9rez-Foguet_2010b_15-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Jim\u00e9nez_and_P\u00e9rez-Foguet_2010b-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-WaterAid_2009_16-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-WaterAid_2009-16\">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup> Lessons that have been learned from this analysis might help local governments and other agencies to address the sustainability challenge.The Water Point Data Exchange (WPDx), launched in 2015, is a global platform for sharing water point data collected by governments, non-profit organizations, researchers, and others.<sup id=\"cite_ref-17\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-17\">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Advocacy\">Advocacy</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Water_point_mapping&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10\" title=\"Edit section: Advocacy\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Maps are also a powerful tool for advocacy, since they provide clear messages and communicate complex information quickly and accurately.

For example, the h2.0 initiative of UN Habitat and Google, the Water Point Mapper developed by WaterAid, or the support made by the Water and Sanitation program to the establishment of WatSan portals in many African countries.\n</p><p>Researchers at <a href=\"/wiki/Overseas_Development_Institute\" title=\"Overseas Development Institute\">ODI</a> found that Water Mapping could improve accountability in service delivery. Accountability could be achieved through the creation of Community Maps and the public availability of mapping knowledge which empower the community.<sup id=\"cite_ref-18\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-18\">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Monitoring_the_sector\">Monitoring the sector</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Water_point_mapping&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11\" title=\"Edit section: Monitoring the sector\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>WPM is an adequate tool to support monitoring and evaluation of the sector. Water poverty follows a highly heterogeneous pattern, widely varying between and within different geographic and administrative units; and mapping permits a feasible visualization of such heterogeneity.
