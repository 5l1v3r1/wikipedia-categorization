The company's product portfolio comprises water purification systems, desalination systems and solar power sets.    Based on ultraviolet and reverse osmosis technologies, SolarWave's systems are suitable for use in remote and rural areas because it integrates solar power supply and requires no previous infrastructure. These systems also help serve private home owners needing small and reliable water treatment systems which are easy to operate and are environmentally friendly.

The project provides safe drinking water to 10 remote villages in Tanzania and reduces CO2 emissions by replacing traditional water purification; boiling of water using firewood, with SolarWave's environmentally friendly technology.
