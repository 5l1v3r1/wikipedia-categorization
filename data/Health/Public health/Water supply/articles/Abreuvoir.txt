An abreuvoir (French: watering place, trough), can mean a basin containing water or a type of masonry joint.  An abreuvoir[pronunciation?] is a watering trough, fountain, or other installed basin: originally intended to provide humans and/or animals at a rural or urban watering place with fresh drinking water. They were often located at springs. In pre-automobile era cities, they were built as equestrian water troughs for horses providing transportation. In contemporary times, abreuvoirs are also seen as civic or private fountains in the designed townscape-landscape. In stonemasonry, as an old or obsolete term, an abreuvoir is a joint or interstice between two stones, to be filled with mortar by a stonemason.
