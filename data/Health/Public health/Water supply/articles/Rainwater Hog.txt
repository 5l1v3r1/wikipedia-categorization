Rainwater HOG is a modular rainwater storage tank which can be used horizontally or vertically for rainwater harvesting, emergency water storage, and post-filter greywater storage. Rainwater HOG was named a USA Top-10 Green Building Product in 2008  and won a Spark Design Award  and two additional sustainable product awards, a California Home & Design award  and a Green Log Award  in 2009. The Rainwater HOG was designed by the award-winning architectural innovator Sally Dominguez for use in tight spaces and is sized to allow designers and engineers to use the stored water as effective thermal mass inside a structure. Rainwater HOG modules were used by David Gottfried, founder of the U.S. Green Building Council, to achieve the USA's first LEED Platinum Home Remodel.  Gottfried used HOGs to store rainwater for flushing ultra-low-flush toilets, and additional HOGs to store filtered Greywater for use on the non-edible portion of the landscape.
