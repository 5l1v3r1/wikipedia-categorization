The term is also often applied to wastewater tariffs. Water and wastewater tariffs are not charged for water itself, but to recover the costs of <a href=\"/wiki/Water_treatment\" title=\"Water treatment\">water treatment</a>, water storage, transporting it to customers, collecting and <a href=\"/wiki/Wastewater_treatment\" title=\"Wastewater treatment\">treating wastewater</a>, as well as billing and collection. Prices paid for water itself are different from water tariffs. They exist in a few countries and are called water abstraction charges or fees. Abstraction charges are not covered in this article, but in the article on <a href=\"/wiki/Water_pricing\" title=\"Water pricing\">water pricing</a>). Water tariffs vary widely in their structure and level between countries, cities and sometimes between user categories (residential, commercial, industrial or public buildings). The mechanisms to adjust tariffs also vary widely.\n</p><p>Most <a href=\"/wiki/Water_industry\" title=\"Water industry\">water utilities</a> in the world are publicly owned, but some are privately owned or managed (see <a href=\"/wiki/Water_privatization\" title=\"Water privatization\">water privatization</a>). Utilities are network industries and <a href=\"/wiki/Natural_monopoly\" title=\"Natural monopoly\">natural monopolies</a>. Economic theory predicts that unregulated private utilities set the price of their product at a level that allows to extract a <a href=\"/wiki/Monopoly_profit\" title=\"Monopoly profit\">monopoly profit</a>. However, in reality tariffs charged by utilities are regulated. They can be set below costs, at the level of cost recovery without a return on capital, or at the level of cost recovery including a predetermined <a href=\"/wiki/Rate_of_return\" title=\"Rate of return\">rate of return</a> on capital. In many developing countries tariffs are set below the level of cost recovery, even without considering a rate of return on capital [ref]. This often leads to a lack of maintenance and requires significant subsidies for both investment and operation. In developed countries water and, to a lesser degree, wastewater tariffs, are typically set close to or at the level of cost recovery, sometimes including an allowance for profit[ref].\n</p><p>Criteria for tariff setting\n</p><p>Water tariffs are set based on a number of formal criteria defined by law, as well as informal criteria.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> Formal criteria typically include:\n</p>\n<ul><li>financial criteria (cost recovery),</li>\n<li>economic criteria (efficiency pricing based on <a href=\"/wiki/Marginal_cost\" title=\"Marginal cost\">marginal cost</a>) and sometimes</li>\n<li>environmental criteria (incentives for <a href=\"/wiki/Water_conservation\" title=\"Water conservation\">water conservation</a>).</li></ul>\n<p>Social and political considerations often are also important in setting tariffs. Tariff structure and levels are influenced in some cases by the desire to avoid an overly high burden for poor users. Political considerations in water pricing often lead to a delay in the approval of tariff increases in the run-up to elections.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> Another criterion for tariff setting is that water tariffs should be easy to understand for consumers. This is not always the case for the more complex types of tariffs, such as increasing-block tariffs and tariffs that differentiate between different categories of users.\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Tariff_structures\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Tariff structures</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Types_of_tariff_structures\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Types of tariff structures</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#International_tariff_surveys\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">International tariff surveys</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Prevalence_of_tariff_structure_types\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Prevalence of tariff structure types</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Tariff_levels\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Tariff levels</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#Difficulties_related_to_tariff_comparisons\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Difficulties related to tariff comparisons</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#Tariff_levels_2\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Tariff levels</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#Tariff_adjustment_processes\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Tariff adjustment processes</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-9\"><a href=\"#Changes_in_water_use_in_response_to_tariff_increases\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Changes in water use in response to tariff increases</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-10\"><a href=\"#Affordability_and_social_protection_measures\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Affordability and social protection measures</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-11\"><a href=\"#Affordability\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Affordability</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-12\"><a href=\"#Social_protection_measures\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Social protection measures</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-13\"><a href=\"#See_also\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">See also</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-14\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">7</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-15\"><a href=\"#Further_reading\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">8</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Further reading</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Tariff_structures\">Tariff structures</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Water_tariff&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Tariff structures\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>There are numerous different tariff structures.

The latter may include a minimum consumption or not. The level of the fixed charge often depends on the diameter of the connection.\n</p><p>Volumetric tariffs can\n</p>\n<ul><li>be proportional to consumption (linear tariffs),</li>\n<li>increase with consumption (increasing-block tariffs, IBT), or</li>\n<li>decrease with consumption (decreasing-block tariffs, DBT).</li></ul>\n<p>The tariff for a first block on an IBT is usually set at a very low tariff with the objective to protect poor households that are assumed to consume less water than non-poor households. The size of the first block can vary from 5&#160;cubic meters to 50&#160;cubic meters per household and month. In <a href=\"/wiki/Water_supply_and_sanitation_in_South_Africa\" title=\"Water supply and sanitation in South Africa\">South Africa</a>, the first block of consumption of 6&#160;cubic meters per household and month is even provided for free (free basic water). Average monthly water consumption varies depending on household size and consumption habits between about 4&#160;cubic meters for a single-person household in temperate climate (e.g. in Germany) with no outdoor water use and about 50&#160;cubic meters for a four-person household in warm climate (e.g. in the Southern United States) including outdoor water use.\n</p><p>Wastewater tariffs typically follow the same structure as water tariffs. They are typically measured based on the volume of water supplied, sometimes after subtracting an allowance made for estimated or actual outdoor use. In the case of industries, wastewater tariffs are sometimes differentiated based on the pollutant load of the wastewater. In some cases wastewater tariffs are a fixed percentage of water tariffs, but usually they are set separately. In addition to regular bills, many utilities levy a one-time connection fee both for water and for sewer connections.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"International_tariff_surveys\">International tariff surveys</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Water_tariff&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: International tariff surveys\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The <b><a href=\"/wiki/OECD\" title=\"OECD\">OECD</a></b> conducted two surveys of <i>residential</i> water tariffs in 1999 and in 2007-08, using a reference consumption of 15&#160;cubic meters per household and month. The 2007-08 survey covered more than 150 cities in all 30 OECD member countries. The survey does not claim to be representative. The OECD survey was complemented by a survey of the industry information service <b>Global Water Intelligence</b> (GWI) conducted in 2007-2008 in parallel with the second OECD survey. The 2008 GWI survey covered 184 utilities in OECD countries and 94 utilities in non-OECD countries.<sup id=\"cite_ref-OECD_Tariffs_3-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-OECD_Tariffs-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> GWI has repeated its survey every year from 2009 to 2012, increasing the number of utilities surveyed to 310 in 2012.

Since the late 1980s there has been a trend in OECD countries away from decreasing-block tariffs, which are apparently only still found in some cities of the United States. Where fixed charges exist as part of two-part tariffs, there is a shift toward the reduction or even abolition of large minimum free allowances in OECD countries. For example, Australia and South Korea have both moved in this direction during the 1990s.<sup id=\"cite_ref-OECD_1999_8-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-OECD_1999-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> Flat rates are still reported in <a href=\"/wiki/Water_supply_and_sanitation_in_Canada\" title=\"Water supply and sanitation in Canada\">Canada</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Water_supply_and_sanitation_in_Mexico\" title=\"Water supply and sanitation in Mexico\">Mexico</a>, New Zealand, Norway and the <a href=\"/wiki/Water_supply_and_sanitation_in_the_United_Kingdom\" title=\"Water supply and sanitation in the United Kingdom\">United Kingdom</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-OECD_Tariffs_3-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-OECD_Tariffs-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Concerning developing countries and <a href=\"/wiki/Transition_economy\" title=\"Transition economy\">transition economies</a>, in the non-representative GWI sample of 94 utilities in 54 countries, 59 used linear volumetric tariffs and 31 used increasing-block tariffs.<sup id=\"cite_ref-OECD_Tariffs_3-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-OECD_Tariffs-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> However, utilities from Sub-Saharan Africa where increasing-block tariffs are very common are under-represented in the GWI sample with only 6 utilities.

The lowest water tariffs in the world are found in Turkmenistan and Cook Islands, where residential water is provided for free, followed by Uzbekistan with a water tariff equivalent to US$0.01 per m3 and no wastewater tariff<sup id=\"cite_ref-tariffs.ib-net.org_9-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-tariffs.ib-net.org-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Difficulties_related_to_tariff_comparisons\">Difficulties related to tariff comparisons</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Water_tariff&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Difficulties related to tariff comparisons\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>There are two basic ways to calculate water and wastewater tariff levels for the purpose of comparing tariff levels between cities: One way is to calculate an average tariff for the utility. This is done by dividing total tariff revenues by the total consumption billed across all usage categories and all levels of consumption. Another way is to determine a typical level of consumption and calculate the residential tariff that corresponds to this consumption. Depending on which of these two methods is used the resulting tariff can vary significantly for the same utility.\n</p><p>The comparison of water and wastewater tariffs across countries is further complicated by the choice of the appropriate exchange rate (<a href=\"/wiki/Nominal_exchange_rate\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Nominal exchange rate\">nominal exchange rates</a> for a given year or over the average of several years, or <a href=\"/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity\" title=\"Purchasing power parity\">purchasing power parity</a> exchange rates).\n</p><p>Furthermore, providing a global overview of water tariff levels is complicated by the large number of service providers (utilities). In urban areas in the United States alone, there are more than 4,000 water utilities. In Germany there are more than 1,200 utilities. Few countries in the world maintain national databases of water and wastewater tariffs charged by utilities.

In many large countries (China, France, Germany, India, Mexico, South Africa and the United States) the process of price adjustment takes place at the municipal level. Rules for price adjustments vary greatly. In the case of public service provision, tariffs are typically adjusted through a decision by the municipal council after a request by the municipal utility. Some countries, such as <a href=\"/wiki/Water_supply_and_sanitation_in_Germany\" title=\"Water supply and sanitation in Germany\">Germany</a>, stipulate by law that all the financial costs of service provision must be recovered through tariff revenues. Other countries define cost recovery as a long-term objective, such as in <a href=\"/wiki/Water_supply_and_sanitation_in_Mexico\" title=\"Water supply and sanitation in Mexico\">Mexico</a>. In the case of private service providers tariff adjustment rules are often laid out in concession or lease contracts, often providing for <a href=\"/wiki/Indexation\" title=\"Indexation\">indexation</a> to <a href=\"/wiki/Inflation\" title=\"Inflation\">inflation</a>.\n</p><p>In some developing countries, water tariffs are set at the national level. Tariff increases are often considered a politically sensitive issue and have to be decided by the Cabinet of Ministers or a National Pricing Commission. This is the case in many countries of the Middle East and North Africa (<a href=\"/wiki/Water_supply_and_sanitation_in_Egypt\" title=\"Water supply and sanitation in Egypt\">Egypt</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Water_supply_and_sanitation_in_Jordan\" title=\"Water supply and sanitation in Jordan\">Jordan</a>, Lebanon, <a href=\"/wiki/Water_supply_and_sanitation_in_Morocco\" title=\"Water supply and sanitation in Morocco\">Morocco</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Water_supply_and_sanitation_in_Syria\" title=\"Water supply and sanitation in Syria\">Syria</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Water_supply_and_sanitation_in_Tunisia\" title=\"Water supply and sanitation in Tunisia\">Tunisia</a>), as well as in many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. In many countries, there are no objective criteria for tariff adjustments. Adjustments tend to be infrequent and often lag behind inflation so that cost recovery remains elusive.\n</p><p>Some countries have created <a href=\"/wiki/Economic_regulation\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Economic regulation\">regulatory agencies</a> at the national level that review requests for tariff adjustments submitted by service providers. The earliest and best-known example is the regulatory agency OFWAT, which was established for <a href=\"/wiki/Water_supply_and_sanitation_in_England\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Water supply and sanitation in England\">England</a> and Wales in 1989. Some developing countries followed suit. They include <a href=\"/wiki/Water_supply_and_sanitation_in_Chile\" title=\"Water supply and sanitation in Chile\">Chile</a> (1990), <a href=\"/wiki/Water_supply_and_sanitation_in_Colombia\" title=\"Water supply and sanitation in Colombia\">Colombia</a> (1994), <a href=\"/wiki/Water_supply_and_sanitation_in_Honduras\" title=\"Water supply and sanitation in Honduras\">Honduras</a> (2004), Kenya, <a href=\"/wiki/Water_supply_and_sanitation_in_Mozambique\" title=\"Water supply and sanitation in Mozambique\">Mozambique</a> (1998), <a href=\"/wiki/Water_supply_and_sanitation_in_Peru\" title=\"Water supply and sanitation in Peru\">Peru</a> (1994), <a href=\"/wiki/Water_supply_and_sanitation_in_Portugal\" title=\"Water supply and sanitation in Portugal\">Portugal</a> (1997), and <a href=\"/wiki/Water_supply_and_sanitation_in_Zambia\" title=\"Water supply and sanitation in Zambia\">Zambia</a> (2000). The review process is typically based on transparent and objective criteria set by law, in an attempt to move decision-making at least partly out of the realm of politics. The track record of these agencies has been diverse, usually mirroring the political and administrative traditions of each country.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Changes_in_water_use_in_response_to_tariff_increases\">Changes in water use in response to tariff increases</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Water_tariff&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: Changes in water use in response to tariff increases\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The responsiveness of demand to a change in price is measured by the <a href=\"/wiki/Price_elasticity_of_demand\" title=\"Price elasticity of demand\">price elasticity of demand</a>, which is defined as the percentage change in demand divided by the percentage change in price.

This share varies between 1.1% (Sweden, Netherlands, Italy) and 5.3% in the Slovak Republic, 9.0% in Poland and 10.3% in Turkey.<sup id=\"cite_ref-OECD_Tariffs_3-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-OECD_Tariffs-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> The <a href=\"/wiki/OECD\" title=\"OECD\">OECD</a> concludes that in half its member countries (15 out of 30), affordability of water charges for low-income households \"is either a significant issue now or might become one in the future, if appropriate policy measures are not put in place.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-OECD_Social_15-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-OECD_Social-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup> In developing countries the situation is more serious, not only because of lower incomes, but also because the poor are often not connected to the network. They usually pay a higher share of their meager incomes for lower quantities of water at often lower quality supplied by water vendors through trucks. On the other hand, utility bills paid by those fortunate enough to be connected to the network are often relatively low, especially in South Asia. Because of this situation the OECD does not recommend to use uniform \"thresholds\" for the affordability of water and wastewater bills. These \"thresholds\" are often quoted in the range of 3-5% of household income.<sup id=\"cite_ref-OECD_Tariffs_3-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-OECD_Tariffs-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Social_protection_measures\">Social protection measures</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Water_tariff&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12\" title=\"Edit section: Social protection measures\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Social protection measures to ensure that piped water remains affordable can be broadly classified into income support measures and tariff-related measures. Income support measures address the individual customer\u2019s ability to pay from the income side (through income assistance, water services vouchers, tariff rebates and discounts, bill re-phasing and easier payment plans, arrears forgiveness).<sup id=\"cite_ref-OECD_Social_15-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-OECD_Social-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup> An example of income assistance to poor users is the subsidy system applied in <a href=\"/wiki/Water_supply_and_sanitation_in_Chile\" title=\"Water supply and sanitation in Chile\">Chile</a>. Tariff-related measures keep the size of water bills low for certain groups (e.g. refinement of increasing-block tariffs, tariff choice, tariff capping).<sup id=\"cite_ref-OECD_Social_15-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-OECD_Social-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup> Examples of increasing block tariffs with a price of zero in the first block are found in <a href=\"/wiki/Water_supply_and_sanitation_in_Belgium\" title=\"Water supply and sanitation in Belgium\">Flanders</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Water_supply_and_sanitation_in_South_Africa\" title=\"Water supply and sanitation in South Africa\">South Africa</a>. Another measure is the cross-subsidization using different tariffs for different neighborhoods, as practiced in <a href=\"/wiki/Water_supply_and_sanitation_in_Colombia\" title=\"Water supply and sanitation in Colombia\">Colombia</a>. A similar approach has been used at the national level in <a href=\"/wiki/Water_supply_and_sanitation_in_Portugal\" title=\"Water supply and sanitation in Portugal\">Portugal</a>. The Portuguese economic water regulator carried out an affordability study that found out that 10.5% of the population paid more than 3% of their income for water and wastewater services. As a result, the regulator showed flexibility concerning tariff increases and tariff solutions in municipalities where affordability was a particular issue.<sup id=\"cite_ref-OECD_Tariffs_3-6\"
