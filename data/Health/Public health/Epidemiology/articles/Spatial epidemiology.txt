Spatial epidemiology is a subfield of health geography focused on the study of the spatial distribution of health outcomes. Specifically, spatial epidemiology is concerned with the description and examination of disease and its geographic variations. This is done in consideration of â€œdemographic, environmental, behavioral, socioeconomic, genetic, and infections risk factors."  Because the statistical models used to draw up such research are complex, the data analysis and the interpretation of results should be carried out by qualified statisticians. Sometimes, the proliferation of errors in disease mapping has led to inefficient decision-making, implementation of inappropriate health policies and negative impact on the advancement of scientific knowledge.
