Internet-mediated research (IMR) is the practice of gathering medical, biomedical or health related research data via the internet directly from research subjects. The subject, uses a web browser to view and respond to questionnaires that are included in an approved medical research protocol. In a traditional medical research study, the principal investigator, Research Coordinator, or other study staff conducts an interview with the research subject and records the information on a paper or electronic case report form. Using IMR, the research subject instead responds to a questionnaire without the guidance of a research staff member, often performing the action at a time and place disassociated with the research clinic, using only a computer connected to the internet and a standard browser. Recently, the medical community has begun to study whether there are differences between IMR data and traditionally collected data.
