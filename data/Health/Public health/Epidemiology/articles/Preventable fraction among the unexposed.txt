In epidemiology, preventable fraction among the unexposed (PFu), is the proportion of incidents in the unexposed group that could be prevented by exposure. It is calculated as                         P                    F                        u                             =         (                    I                        u                             −                    I                        e                             )                    /                             I                        u                             =         1         −         R         R                 {\displaystyle PF_{u}=(I_{u}-I_{e})/I_{u}=1-RR}    , where                                    I                        e                                     {\displaystyle I_{e}}     is the incidence in the exposed group,                                    I                        u                                     {\displaystyle I_{u}}     is the incidence in the unexposed group, and                         R         R                 {\displaystyle RR}     is the relative risk.   It is a synonym of the relative risk reduction. It is used when an exposure reduces the risk, as opposed to increasing it, in which case its symmetrical notion is attributable fraction among the exposed.
