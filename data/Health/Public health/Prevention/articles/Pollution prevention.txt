Pollution prevention (P2) reduces the amount of pollution generated by industries, agriculture, or consumers. In contrast to pollution control strategies which seek to manage a pollutant after it is produced and to reduce its impact on the environment, the pollution prevention approach seeks to increase efficiency of a process, reducing the amount of pollution generated. Although there is wide agreement that source reduction is the preferred strategy, some professionals also use the term pollution prevention.  With increasing human population, pollution has become a great concern. The US Environmental Protection Agency works to introduce pollution prevention programs to reduce and manage waste.  Reducing and managing pollution may decrease the number of deaths and illnesses from pollution-related diseases. As an environmental management strategy, pollution prevention shares many attributes with cleaner production, a term used more commonly outside the United States. Pollution prevention encompasses more specialized sub-disciplines including green chemistry and green design (also known as environmentally conscious design).
