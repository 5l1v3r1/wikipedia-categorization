PositiveSingles is a free friendship, social and dating website that specifically caters to people who are living with sexually transmitted diseases (STD).   Its services are mainly provided in North America and Europe. PositiveSingles was founded in 2001 and its headquarters are in Vaughan, Ontario. The company is privately held. Launched in Mountain View, California in 2001, PositiveSingles claims to be "The best, largest, completely anonymous and most trusted online dating site for people with Herpes, HPV, HIV / AIDS, Hepatitis, Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, Syphilis and other STD" on its homepage. The slogan of PositiveSingles is "Stay Positive! Find Love, Support & Hope" in contrast to its previous slogan "We Are Not Alone!" PositiveSingles was founded in 2001 as a free STD dating site. Membership was divided into guest and gold membership a year later. In 2007, STD Q & A (live counselor) was added on PositiveSingles, where every member can anonymously (if they choose to) ask questions about STDs and STD counselor will reply to each one. Members can put forward their own advice as well. Any information provided by users will be kept confidential. In July, 2010, PositiveSingles added a feature named STD Legal Information. This feature was made on account of the particularity of the special group. PositiveSingles members can obtain legal information regarding their STD status as well as learn how to protect themselves from legal encounters. In 2012, PositiveSingles launched its apps for iOS and Android devices, which provide full functionality as the website. PositiveSingles charges no fee when users register, search or browse profiles, send winks to another user. However, gold membership (i.e., paid) is required to use some of its premium features.
