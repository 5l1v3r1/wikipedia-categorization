Dry sex is the sexual practice of having sexual intercourse without vaginal lubrication. Vaginal lubrication can be removed by using herbal aphrodisiacs, household detergents, antiseptics,  by wiping out the vagina,  or by placing leaves in the vagina  besides other methods.  Dry sex is associated with increased health risks. Removing or preventing vaginal lubrication through practices associated with dry sex increases friction during intercourse, which may be perceived as increased vaginal tightness, and enhanced sexual pleasure for the male partner.  Some men who insist on dry sex regard "wet" women to be unchaste.  Dry sex can be painful for men   and women.  Dry sex is common in Sub-Saharan Africa   and it has also been reported in Suriname among Afro-Surinamese women.  The practice has been linked to the high incidence of HIV/AIDS infection in Sub-Saharan Africa.  The practice is regarded as increasing the risk of transmitting sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) for both partners, including HIV   in a number of ways. Increased friction during intercourse may cause lacerations in vaginal tissue.  Drying the vagina also removes the natural antiseptic lactobacilli which can combat sexually transmitted diseases.  Furthermore, dry sex increases the risk that a condom will break because of the increased friction. It may also result in vaginal inflammation and/or traumatic lesions which in turn may increase the transmission of STDs in other ways.
