56 Dean Street, based in Dean Street in London's Soho district, is the city's largest sexual health clinic.  Part of the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, it also has a second branch, Dean Street Express,   at 34 Dean Street, which offers a fast-turnaround testing service.  As of 2017, the clinic was the largest HIV clinic in Europe.  In addition to its specialism in HIV infection and other sexually transmitted diseases, it also offers general sexual health care services, including contraception.  The clinic has made the provision of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) a priority,  with the result that new HIV infection rates in London have dropped dramatically since the introduction of the new policy.   As of  2018[update], limitations on funding have substantially reduced the clinic's ability to offer its services, with significant reductions in the number of appointments available each day.
