Bacterial vaginosis is caused by an imbalance of the naturally occurring bacteria in the vagina.    The normally predominant species of Lactobacilli are markedly reduced.  This is the list of organisms that are found in the vagina that are associated with bacterial vaginosis, an infectious disease of the vagina caused by excessive growth of specific bacteria.   The census and relationships among the microbiota are altered in BV resulting in a complex bacterial milieu. Some species have been identified relatively recently.  Having infections with the listed pathogens increases the risk of acquiring other sexually transmitted infections including HIV/AIDS.
