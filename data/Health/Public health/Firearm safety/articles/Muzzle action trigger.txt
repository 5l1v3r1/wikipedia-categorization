Muzzle-Action-trigger often used in the US military and ROTC rifle programs. The steps are defined as:  1) Muzzle - Keep your muzzle under control on and off the range even if it's not loaded or armed. Keep your muzzle free of obstructions and dirt.  2) Action - Check to see if the bolt is pulled back into the unarmed position, make sure there is no ammunition inside, check for a CBI (see also clear barrel indicator C.B.I.). Make sure that the bolt area is clean of debris and that there is no ammunition in it.  3) Trigger - KEEP YOUR FINGER OFF THE TRIGGER UNTIL YOU'RE AT THE FIRING POSITION AND READY TO FIRE even with safety. Remember safety is no accident. Remember to report all problems and safety issues to you range master. Also remember that YOU are a safety officer! only you can prevent accidents if you see an unsafe action yell "CEASE FIRE!"
