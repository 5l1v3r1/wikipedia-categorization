A trigger guard is a loop surrounding the trigger of a firearm and protecting it from accidental discharge.  Some firearms may have their trigger guard removed or repositioned as not to impair use with large cold weather gloves on, especially those intended to be used in arctic conditions. Other devices such as inhalers, crossbows and power tools may also have trigger guards.
