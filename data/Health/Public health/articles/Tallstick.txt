The Tallstick is a yardstick-like device for field measurement of childhood stunting based on age and sex norms. Its simplicity, portability, and low-cost have made it a popular tool for aide workers and community volunteers in remote areas. Shaped like a yardstick, the Tallstick is marked in ages from birth to five years, with one side blue for boys and the other pink for girls. Markings on each side represent -2 standard deviations from height-for-age values (HAZ<-2).  The Tallstick markings are expressed in years and months and each consecutive mark represents an increment of 1 month in age. Infants below 12 months are measured lying down (recumbent position) while children ages one to five are measured standing up. The child whose length is below the line corresponding to his or her age is recorded as stunted.  The Tallstick was originally developed in 1989 by Marian Zeitlin, PhD, of Tufts University while the field validation was conducted by Mirette Seireg Ohman, MSc, lead investigator of the Positive Deviance in Nutrition Project in Nicaragua.
