The xylospongium (greek) or tersorium (roman), also known as sponge on a stick, was a hygienic utensil used by ancient Romans to wipe their buttocks after defecating,  consisting of a wooden stick (Greek: ξύλον, Xylon) with a sea sponge (Greek: Σπόγγος, Spongos) fixed at one end. The tersorium was shared by people using public latrines. To clean the sponge, they simply washed it in a bucket with water and salt or vinegar.  This became a breeding ground for bacteria, causing the spread of disease in the latrine.  In the classical antiquity a xylospongium might be used in the same way as we use a toilet brush.  In the baths of the seven sages in Ostia, a fresco from the 2nd century contains the Inscription (u)taris xylosphongio  which is the first known mention of the term. Also in the early second century a papyrus letter of Claudius Terentianus to his father Claudius Tiberianus uses the term xylospongium in a phrase.  In the middle of the first century Seneca reported that a Germanic gladiator had committed suicide with a sponge on a stick. The German hid himself in the latrine of an amphitheater and pushed the wooden stick into his gullet and choked to death.
