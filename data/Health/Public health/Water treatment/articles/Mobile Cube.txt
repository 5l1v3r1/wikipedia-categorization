The Mobile Cube is a cube-shaped system to purify and process dirty water. It was developed by Robert Niederer.  The cube generates electricity using solar cells and a small wind turbine and, therefore, requires no external power source. Solar cells and turbine together provide about 2500 watt, depending on light levels and wind speed.  A pump drives the dirty water through activated carbon filters in which heavy metals and many toxic chemicals are filtered out. After this process, it is safe to drink. The Mobile Cube can be installed and operated anywhere in the world as a very small mobile power station and water treatment system.
