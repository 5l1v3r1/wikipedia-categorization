Oxygenated treatment (OT) is a technique used to reduce corrosion in a boiler and its associated feedwater system in flow-through boilers.  With oxygenated treatment, oxygen is injected into the feedwater to keep the oxygen level between 30-50 ppb. "Common injection points are just after the condensate polisher and again at the deaerator outlet."   This forms a thicker protective layer of hematite (Fe2O3) on top of the magnetite. This is a denser, flatter film (vs. the undulation scale with OT) so that there is less resistance to water flow compared to AVT.   Also, OT reduces the risk of flow-accelerated corrosion.  When OT is used, conductivity after cation exchange (CACE) at the economiser inlet must be maintained  below 0.15Î¼S/cm   this can be achieved by the use of a condensate polisher.
