A traveling screen is a type of water filtration device that has a continuously moving mesh screen that is used to catch and remove debris.   This type of device is usually found in water intake systems for water and wastewater treatment plants.  Screening is considered the first step in conventional sewage treatment processes. Screening is also used in water intakes in power plants. Traveling screens can be used to catch leaves, sticks, grass, jellyfish, trash, green mussels, shells, hydroids, seaweed, and plastics.
