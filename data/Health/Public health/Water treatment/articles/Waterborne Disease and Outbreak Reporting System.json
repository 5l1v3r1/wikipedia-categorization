The WBDOSS receives data about <a href=\"#Definition_of_a_Waterborne_Disease_Outbreak\">waterborne disease outbreaks</a> and single cases of waterborne diseases of public health importance (for example, <a href=\"/wiki/Primary_amoebic_meningoencephalitis\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Primary amoebic meningoencephalitis\">Primary Amebic Meningoencephalitis (PAM)</a>) in the United States and then disseminates information about these diseases, outbreaks, and their causes. WBDOSS was initiated in 1971 by CDC, the <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.cste.org/dnn/\">Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE)</a>, and the <a href=\"/wiki/EPA\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"EPA\">Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)</a>. Data are reported by public health departments in individual states, territories, and the Freely Associated States (composed of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of Palau; formerly parts of the U.S.-administered Trust Territories of the Pacific Islands).  Although initially designed to collect data about drinking water outbreaks in the United States, WBDOSS now includes outbreaks associated with recreational water,  as well as outbreaks associated with water that is not intended for drinking (non-recreational) and water for which the intended use is unknown.<sup id=\"cite_ref-yoder_hlavsa_craun_mmwr_2008_1-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-yoder_hlavsa_craun_mmwr_2008-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-yoder_roberts_craun_mmwr_2008_2-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-yoder_roberts_craun_mmwr_2008-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Definition_of_a_Waterborne_Disease_Outbreak\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Definition of a Waterborne Disease Outbreak</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Data_Sources_for_WBDOSS\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Data Sources for WBDOSS</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Data_Use\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Data Use</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#See_also\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">See also</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#External_links\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">External links</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Definition_of_a_Waterborne_Disease_Outbreak\">Definition of a Waterborne Disease Outbreak</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Waterborne_Disease_and_Outbreak_Reporting_System&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Definition of a Waterborne Disease Outbreak\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Waterborne disease outbreaks may be associated with recreational water, water intended for drinking, water not intended for drinking (non-recreational water, for example, from cooling towers or ornamental fountains) and water of unknown intent. In order for a waterborne disease outbreak to be included in WBDOSS there must be an epidemiologic link between two or more persons that includes a location of water exposure, a clearly defined time period for the water exposure, and one or more waterborne illnesses caused by pathogens such as bacteria, parasites and viruses, or by chemicals/toxins. Common routes of exposure to waterborne pathogens include swallowing contaminated water, inhaling water droplets or airborne chemicals from the water, and direct physical contact with contaminated water. Epidemiologic evidence must implicate water or volatile compounds from the water that have entered the air as the probable source of the illness. WBDOSS outbreaks are further evaluated and classified based on the strength of evidence in the outbreak report that implicates water as the source of the outbreak. Waterborne disease outbreaks that have both strong epidemiologic data and comprehensive water-quality testing data are assigned a higher class than outbreaks with weak epidemiologic data and little or no water-quality testing data.<sup id=\"cite_ref-yoder_hlavsa_craun_mmwr_2008_1-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-yoder_hlavsa_craun_mmwr_2008-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-yoder_roberts_craun_mmwr_2008_2-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-yoder_roberts_craun_mmwr_2008-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Data_Sources_for_WBDOSS\">Data Sources for WBDOSS</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Waterborne_Disease_and_Outbreak_Reporting_System&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Data Sources for WBDOSS\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Public health departments investigate waterborne disease outbreaks in states, territories, and Freely Associated States and are essential contributors to the WBDOSS.
