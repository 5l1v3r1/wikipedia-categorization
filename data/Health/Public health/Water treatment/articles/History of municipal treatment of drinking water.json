The Chelsea filter was a <a href=\"/wiki/Slow_sand_filter\" title=\"Slow sand filter\">slow sand filter</a> which consisted of a two-foot layer of sand with layers of shells gravel and bricks beneath. The Chelsea filter was capable of clearing 95 percent of impurities from the water.

By the 1830s the water closet was widely used in London. Household drains could not be connected to the city's sewers, but after 1815 this prohibition was lifted. Water closets could now empty into the cities sewer which in turn emptied into the <a href=\"/wiki/Thames\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Thames\">Thames</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> This was a disaster for the river. In 1816 salmon could be caught in the Thames, four years later none could be caught. The water closet overloaded the medieval <a href=\"/wiki/Cesspool\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cesspool\">cesspool</a> system which was still in use. The use of water to dispose of sewage in the water closets filed the cesspools ten to twenty times quicker. Cesspools before this had received mostly solid waste. The rapid filling caused seepage. By 1844 the Metropolitan Buildings act simply required new buildings to be connected to street sewers.<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> The tidal nature of the Thames did not help the matter.\n</p><p>A similar situation was occurring in the US. Water consumption was increasing, for example in <a href=\"/wiki/Chicago\" title=\"Chicago\">Chicago</a> the per capita water consumption was 33 gallons per day in 1856 to 144 gallons in 1882 (although this figure also includes industrial sources). This increased water consumption and the growing use water closets overloaded the existing cesspool system and served to contaminate the surrounding soil and watercourses.<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Disease\">Disease</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=History_of_municipal_treatment_of_drinking_water&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Disease\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>An increase in the awareness of the transmission of diseases such as <a href=\"/wiki/Cholera\" title=\"Cholera\">cholera</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Typhoid\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Typhoid\">typhoid</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Yellow_fever\" title=\"Yellow fever\">yellow fever</a> in the 19th century manifested in a growing need to filter and treat municipal drinking water.

The <a href=\"/wiki/Miasmatic_theory\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Miasmatic theory\">miasmatic theory</a> advocated that disease was transmitted by smell and foul odors arising from putrefaction of organic matter.

The United States by this time had begun to introduce filtration into its municipal water supplies as a means of removing sediment form water in the 1870s through 90s. The United States also introduced the <a href=\"/wiki/Rapid_sand_filter\" title=\"Rapid sand filter\">rapid sand filter</a> which were a derivation of filters used in the paper making industry. The rapid filters and the slow sand filters engaged in competition as to which technology was superior. By the beginning of the 20th century, an increased knowledge in bacteriology led to improvements in the slow sand filters as well as the design of rapid filters. It soon became apparent that slow sand filters could remove typhoid germs.<sup id=\"cite_ref-14\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Treatment as well as filtration began to be used in the early 20th century. <a href=\"/wiki/Water_chlorination\" title=\"Water chlorination\">Water chlorination</a> as a means of treatment began to be used in the late 19th century. <a href=\"/wiki/Bleaching_powder\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Bleaching powder\">Bleaching powder</a> was the first material used for chlorination. <a href=\"/wiki/Middelkerke,_Belgium\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Middelkerke, Belgium\">Middelkerke, Belgium</a>, would become the first city to chlorinate its water, in 1902, and <a href=\"/wiki/Jersey_City,_New_Jersey\" title=\"Jersey City, New Jersey\">Jersey City, New Jersey</a>, became the first in city in the United States to do so, in 1909.
