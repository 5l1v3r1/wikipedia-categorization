Macrophagic Myofasciitis, or MMF, is a rare muscle disease identified in 1993.  The disease is characterized by microscopic lesions found in muscle biopsies that show infiltration of muscle tissue by PAS-positive macrophages.  Specific causes of MMF are unknown. Intramuscular injections of aluminium-containing vaccines have been implicated.  Many of those affected with the disease had previously been treated for malaria with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine.  Clinical symptoms include muscle pain, joint pain, muscle weakness, fatigue, fever, and muscle tenderness. A diagnosis can only be identified with an open muscle biopsy of the vaccinated muscle.  Studies at the University of Paris have shown that MMF lesions result when the aluminum hydroxide adjuvant from a vaccine remains embedded in the tissue and causes a steady immune reaction.     As of 2009 and with few exceptions, MMF had only been observed in France.
