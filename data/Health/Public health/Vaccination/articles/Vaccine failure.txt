A vaccine failure is when an organism develops a disease in spite of being vaccinated against it. Primary vaccine failure occurs when an organism's immune system does not produce antibodies when first vaccinated.  Vaccines can fail when several series are given and fail to produce an immune response. The name does not necessarily imply that the vaccine is defective. Most vaccine failures are simply from individual variations in immune response.
