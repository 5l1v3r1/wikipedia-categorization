{"parse":{"title":"Reactogenicity","pageid":37494278,"revid":858054651,"text":{"*":"<div class=\"mw-parser-output\"><p>In <a href=\"/wiki/Clinical_trials\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Clinical trials\">clinical trials</a>, the term <b>reactogenicity</b> refers to the property of a <a href=\"/wiki/Vaccine\" title=\"Vaccine\">vaccine</a> of being able to produce common, \u201cexpected\u201d adverse reactions, especially excessive immunological responses and associated signs and symptoms\u2014fever, sore arm at injection site, etc. (Much less frequently, the term has also been applied to therapeutic drug trials.) Other manifestations of reactogenicity typically assessed in such trials include <a href=\"/wiki/Bruising\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Bruising\">bruising</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Redness\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Redness\">redness</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Induration\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Induration\">induration</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Swelling_(medical)\" title=\"Swelling (medical)\">swelling</a>. \n</p><p>The term reactogenicity was coined by the US <a href=\"/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration\" title=\"Food and Drug Administration\">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA). Typically, reactogenicity is seen in the presence of an <a href=\"/wiki/Adjuvant\" title=\"Adjuvant\">adjuvant</a> (chemical additive intended to enhance the recipient's immune response to the vaccine <a href=\"/wiki/Antigen\" title=\"Antigen\">antigen</a>), but can also occur with non-adjuvanted vaccines. Reactogenicity describes immediate short-term reactions to vaccines, not long term <a href=\"/wiki/Sequela\" title=\"Sequela\">sequelae</a>. Assessments of reactogenicity are carried out to evaluate the safety and usability of an experimental vaccine (see <a href=\"/wiki/Investigational_New_Drug\" title=\"Investigational New Drug\">Investigational New Drug</a>). It is unclear whether a higher degree of reactogenicity to a vaccine actually correlates with more severe <a href=\"/wiki/Adverse_event\" title=\"Adverse event\">adverse events</a>, such as would require hospitalization or be life-threatening. Occasionally they do, but this could be an accidental concurrence.  After many years of assessing large databases relating to these events, the FDA has not been able to make any such association.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Formal_definitions\">Formal definitions</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Reactogenicity&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Formal definitions\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2><p>\nThe US <a href=\"/wiki/National_Institutes_of_Health\" title=\"National Institutes of Health\">National Institutes of Health</a> (NIH) has provided the following \u201cdefinition of reactogenicity\u201d in a suggested template for clinical trials protocols:<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> </p><blockquote><p>Reactogenicity events are adverse events that are common and known to occur for the intervention/investigational product being studied and should be collected in a standard, systematic format using a graded scale based on functional assessment or magnitude of reaction.

This information is found on the CIB or package insert.
