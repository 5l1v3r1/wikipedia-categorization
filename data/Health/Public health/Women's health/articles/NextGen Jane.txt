NextGen Jane is a data driven women’s healthcare company known for inventing a smart tampon system that offers insight into a woman's reproductive health system.     In 2013 co-founder Ridhi Tariyal was part of the first class of the Blavatnik Fellowship at Harvard University.  The purpose of the fellowship is to place recent MBA graduates in labs across Harvard with the goal to commercialize life science-based enterprises.  Coming out of the fellowship Tariyal and co-founder Stephen Gire developed intellectual property for a Smart Tampon System to gather genomic information about a woman’s health.   NextGen Jane was founded in 2014 with this IP as its core patent technology and its headquarters are located in Oakland, California, United States.  Initially, the company had nothing to do with tampon.  It was about fertility and empowering women to manage their own reproductive health by themselves.  Later on, the tampoon aspect was added to help  women manage their reproductive healthcare much better.   NextGen Jane  offers  insight into women's  reproductive health through its Smart Tampon System - a device that can help track biological changes in a woman’s body and enables them to manage their healthcare more autonomously.
