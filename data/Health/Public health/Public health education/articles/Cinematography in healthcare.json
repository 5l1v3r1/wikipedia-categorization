cameraman, in France his first name was written as Boleslas), and <a href=\"/wiki/Gheorghe_Marinescu\" title=\"Gheorghe Marinescu\">Gheorghe Marinescu</a> (Romanian neurologist) are some of the pioneers of medical cinematography.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In 1888, Doyen had his surgeries captured on film. His films were brought into disrepute by the fact that they were copied and shown on fairgrounds. The resulting social prejudice may explain the slow take-off of medical cinematography.  For example, in 1910 someone said the following regarding Doyen\u2019s videos: ,\u201cThese pictures savoured of advertisement, and were never popular, save as a side show among the less scientifically inclined members of the profession.\u201d <sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>  Doyen\u2019s work, however, marked the distinction between the concepts of \u2018film for entertainment\u2019 versus \u2018film for medicine\u2019.\n</p><p>In 1893 Marey used the technique to study human physiology and <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11lKItGNuiY\">movement</a>. In 1898 Boleslas Matuszewski recorded medical films in Paris (at the time, the world\u2019s neurologic capital). At <a href=\"/wiki/Piti%C3%A9-Salp%C3%AAtri%C3%A8re_Hospital\" title=\"Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re Hospital\">Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re and Piti\u00e9 hospitals</a> he filmed surgeries and cases of persons affected by nervous and mental disorders.\n</p><p>Gheorghe Marinescu (Romanian neurologist) studied under renowned French professor <a href=\"/wiki/Jean-Martin_Charcot\" title=\"Jean-Martin Charcot\">Jean-Martin Charcot</a> and returned to Bucharest as Chief Physician at Pantelimon Hospital. Between 1898\u20131902 he conducted a cinematographic project, recording and analyzing a series of neurological conditions in patients. He perfected the application of filming techniques to clinical <a href=\"/wiki/Neurology\" title=\"Neurology\">neurology</a> and published five articles based on cinematographic analysis. Marinescu wrote that the role of cinematography is \u201cto complement and even replace, in whatever measure possible, the descriptive exposition of phenomena by more rigorous, more exact analysis, which consists of recording movement with the help of special procedures\u201d <sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In 1905 <a href=\"/wiki/Arthur_Van_Gehuchten\" title=\"Arthur Van Gehuchten\">Arthur Van Gehuchten</a> (Belgian anatomist and neurologist) began to film neurologic patients and built up a collection of films for teaching purposes.

The view at the time was that \u201cpropagandists saw education as limited to providing facts. Propaganda was designed to control opinions and actions, without having to use direct force. Propaganda appealed to most progressive health reformers as a way of providing genuine popular democratic support for the trained medical elite.\n</p><p>Dr. H. E. Kleinschmidt of the Tuberculosis Association defined good propaganda as \u2018mental inoculation\u2019 whose avowed goal was \u2018will-control through education\u2019. The goal of health propagandists was not simply to inform but to persuade, to control individual thoughts and actions.\u201d <sup id=\"cite_ref-Martin_5-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Martin-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Edison\u2019s film came under criticism for \u201cthe distortions, exaggerations, and inaccuracies inherent in the <a href=\"/wiki/Melodrama\" title=\"Melodrama\">melodrama</a> format.

In 1933, the Journal of Communication published an article regarding <a href=\"/wiki/Immunization\" title=\"Immunization\">immunization</a> propaganda in the US: \u201cDr. Nash has enlisted the cinematograph film. He has noticed that American films illustrating immunization never show the instant of puncture, so that spectators are left to infer something disagreeable. But in the 16 mm. film taken by <a href=\"/wiki/Eastman_Kodak\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Eastman Kodak\">Kodak Ltd.</a> in his own clinic the whole operation is photographed, and although now and then there may be a grimace or a hint of nervousness, there is certainly no crying or resistance. The children in the film, quite unrehearsed, behave perfectly. It is an excellent film and should do much to dispel parental apprehensions.\u201d <sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In a 1935 issue of the <a href=\"/wiki/British_Medical_Journal\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"British Medical Journal\">British Medical Journal</a>, one could read the following advice regarding the use of films in public health: \u201cIf the medical profession wanted, for example, to introduce widespread <a href=\"/wiki/Preventive_healthcare\" title=\"Preventive healthcare\">prophylaxis</a> against <a href=\"/wiki/Diphtheria\" title=\"Diphtheria\">diphtheria</a> it could take a leaf out of Papworth's book and tell a story on the films that would help to wipe out diphtheria in a few years' time. It is no good trying to persuade people of the Tightness of this or that measure of health with the sweet voice of reason. It is the emotional appeal that wins the day; reason follows humbly after. The film, with its forcible assault upon both eye and ear, is a powerful weapon of propaganda. And it could be used with effect for \u2018putting across\u2019 to the public the idea of preventive medicine. Perhaps the Minister of Health, <a href=\"/wiki/Sir_Kingsley_Wood\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sir Kingsley Wood\">Sir Kingsley Wood</a>, a master of propaganda, might enlist the help of the moving picture in his campaign for the improved health of the people.\u201d <sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Contemporary_cinematographic_use_in_healthcare:_healthcare_knowledge_transfer\">Contemporary cinematographic use in healthcare: healthcare knowledge transfer</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Cinematography_in_healthcare&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Contemporary cinematographic use in healthcare: healthcare knowledge transfer\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>By the 1980s, medical films had become an established vehicle of both medical and patient training. A 1987 issue of the <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://journals.lww.com/AJNOnline/pages/default.aspx\">American Journal of Nursing</a> contained a full-page section on Films &amp; Tapes covering broad topics such as Aids to Daily Living for the elderly, working moms, AIDS, alcohol abuse and even emotional fitness.<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Today, the concept of <b>healthcare knowledge transfer</b> recognizes that film clips (with carefully crafted and verified content, and using graphics, animations and live-action video), can be one of the most efficient ways of transferring knowledge with clarity and speed, to both lay-people (patients, families, and friends), and healthcare professionals.\n</p><p>Traditionally the transfer of generic information (i.e. non patient-specific information) tends to happen on a somewhat ad-hoc, live, one-to-one basis, that is generally less well structured, less comprehensive, and thus less successful (whilst also being more expensive and less time efficient).\n</p><p>However, in order to be efficient and effective, the quality of the film\u2019s content must be very high. A patient\u2019s understanding of conditions and treatments is important to their care and well-being, so it is useful for carefully crafted clips to be available 24/7. It also helps patients when attending the all-important one-to-one consultations that are the bedrock of good healthcare. If patients are better informed and better prepared they can focus on their own case rather than generic issues.\n</p><p>The literature in this area also contains examples of what can happen when the film content is not particularly well crafted and presented. In 2000, a UK cancer study highlights the impact of poor quality video. The authors acknowledge that \u201cnot all <a href=\"/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trials\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Randomized controlled trials\">randomised trials</a> of video education, however, have had similarly consistent results. A randomised trial in patients undergoing <a href=\"/wiki/Colonoscopy\" title=\"Colonoscopy\">colonoscopy</a> reported increased knowledge and satisfaction but failed to demonstrate a reduction in anxiety. A similar study in patients receiving <a href=\"/wiki/Genetic_counseling\" title=\"Genetic counseling\">genetic counseling</a> reported similar benefits but again no reduction in anxiety. Two further randomised trials, the first in patients having breast surgery and the second in patients undergoing <a href=\"/wiki/Coronary_angioplasty\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Coronary angioplasty\">coronary angioplasty</a>, failed to show any improvement in satisfaction or anxiety. The variation in these trial results suggests that, like all educational materials, the quality of the content is paramount and how it is used is vital to success. Involving patients in the development and showing patients recounting their personal experience undoubtedly helps. Using respected TV personalities offers the familiar face of respectability and professionalism. Above all, most studies fail to take advantage of the role which video has to play in continuing the educational process at home with their carers and friends, but instead ask patients to watch it in the unfamiliar environment of the clinic.\u201d <sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>With the widespread use of the internet since the late 1990s, there is a tremendous potential for health-related films to be made available, free at the point of need, over the internet.

This 23-minute film, now available on the <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/types/breast/beyond-cancer-video\">National Cancer Institute website</a>, addressed re-entry challenges in four life domains: physical health, emotional well-being, interpersonal relations, and life perspectives. Designed to promote adaptive peer modeling, the film observes four breast cancer survivors as they describe their experience in each of the four domains, as well as active coping skills they used to meet associated challenges. The film also includes commentary by an oncologist expert in breast cancer on the re-entry experience and on active methods for approaching problems during re-entry.\n</p><p>Since then, many video resources have been made available on the internet to cancer survivors and their care providers. Examples include a general education video on the issues of cancer survivorship produced by the IOM, a  video series by <a href=\"/wiki/Living_Beyond_Breast_Cancer\" title=\"Living Beyond Breast Cancer\">Living Beyond Breast Cancer</a>, a national education and support organization, addressing specific and sometimes sensitive issues during breast cancer survivorship.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Video_13-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Video-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Cinematography_in_healthcare&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap mw-references-columns\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Genevi\u00e8ve Aubert.
