In late October 2011, she was charged with theft after being caught on video surveillance shoplifting $2,445 worth of merchandise from San Francisco's Neiman Marcus store.   Prosecutors said that Hayashi had taken the items into a dressing room, put them in a shopping bag, and walked out of the store.  Her attorney stated that she intended to pay for the items but became distracted by a cellphone call and a snack at the cafe and inadvertently left the store without paying.    During the campaign, Hayashi denied that she was responsible for the shoplifting incident, citing a medical condition and distraction.  Hayashi subsequently pleaded no contest to charges of shoplifting. She was sentenced to an $180 fine and three years probation and was ordered to stay more than 50 feet from the store. Her attorney suggested her actions may have been the result of a benign brain tumor.
