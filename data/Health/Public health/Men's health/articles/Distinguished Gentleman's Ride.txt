 The Distinguished Gentleman's Ride is a global motorcycle fund-raising event to raise awareness of prostate cancer and male suicide prevention  Open to all genders, the ride was founded in 2012 by Mark Hawwa in Sydney, Australia — inspired by a photo of Mad Men’s Don Draper on a classic bike in a fine suit.  The ride provides an outline of dress and behaviour, suggesting riders wear dapper clothing, silk vests, tweed suits and behave in an affable manner.  Suggested motorcycles for the themed ride include café racers, bobbers, classics, modern classics, flat trackers, scramblers, old school choppers, brat styled, classic scooters, and classic sidecars.  The ride carries no entry fee, and riders are encouraged to raise sponsorship money for prostate cancer research and male suicide prevention on behalf of charity partner The Movember Foundation. In 2014 Triumph Motorcycles started to support and sponsor the ride,  together with Dime City Cycles in 2015 as prize sponsor. In 2016 Zenith Watches joined Triumph Motorcycles as major co-sponsor with Hedon helmets supporting the event as prize sponsor.   In 2015 one of the three motorcycles ridden by actor Chris Pratt in Jurassic World was auctioned off, with the profits going to the prostate cancer funds.  The event takes place on the last Sunday in September each year.
