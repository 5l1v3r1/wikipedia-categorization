Rete tubular ectasia is a benign condition, usually found in older men, involving numerous small, tubular cystic structures within the rete testis. The formation of cysts in the rete testis is associated with the obstruction of the efferent ducts, which connect the rete testis with the head of the epididymis. They are often bilateral.  The condition can be detected with sonography. It is commonly associated with epididymal abnormalities, such as spermatocele, epididymal cyst, and epididymitis. The condition  shares a common location with cystic dysplasia of the testis and intratesticular cysts. Unlike cystic neoplasms, they don't present specific tumor markers.  Typically none is required, but they can be treated surgically if symptomatic.  Tubular ectasia of the rete testis Tubular ectasia of the rete testis Tubular ectasia of the rete testis
