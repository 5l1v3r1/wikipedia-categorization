The multidisciplinary nature of the Commission\u2019s membership helped shape the shared vision that health can be a driving force for national development.\n</p><p>At the same time, the Commission was not unanimous in its conclusions or recommendations, and heated debates about interpretation of findings and recommended actions were inherent part of its work. In particular, disagreements about where health research should be conducted: should it be in more capable research environments in high income countries where research can be done to higher standards and possibly lead to quicker results and more rapid development of technical interventions or should it be done in low and middle income countries where capacity for research still needed to be built in many instances? In the latter case, the outcome of research studies was not only a research product but also increased research capacity. This same debate continues to this date in virtually the entire field<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources.

Developing countries need stronger scientific and institutional capacity to address problems unique to their circumstances, but sufficient investment is not being made to build and sustain their health research capacity. Especially weak are the critical fields of epidemiology, the policy and social sciences and management research. Biomedical and clinical research are somewhat stronger, but capacity-strengthening efforts in these fields are modest in scale and narrowly targeted.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p></blockquote>\n<h3><span id=\"The_10.2F90_gap\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_10/90_gap\">The 10/90 gap</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Commission_on_Health_Research_for_Development&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: The 10/90 gap\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The mismatch was between conditions that cause ill health and death which mostly occurred in low and middle income countries, and global expenditure on health research which focused mostly on the less severe health conditions prevalent in high income countries, became known as the 10-90 gap. In actual figures, 93% of \u2018potential years of life lost\u2019 occurred in the developing world while 95% of all research expenditures were made in high income countries. To state this in another way, one could say that only 5% of the world\u2019s research expenditures were spent on diseases that caused 93% of global <a href=\"/wiki/Mortality_rate\" title=\"Mortality rate\">mortality</a>.  This mismatch became later known as the <a href=\"/wiki/10/90_gap\" title=\"10/90 gap\">10/90 gap</a> (in health research expenditure). Although this is an oversimplification, it is a very powerful expression of how research did not deliver on its potential to improve health in the developing world because of a skewed allocation of health research resources in the world.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Recommendations\">Recommendations</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Commission_on_Health_Research_for_Development&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Recommendations\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Based on these findings, the Commission made four main recommendations:\n</p><p><b>1.\tEssential National Health Research (ENHR).</b> All countries, no matter how poor, should invest in developing long-term, sustainable research capacity development. With this, countries should identify and prioritize their own research requirements to improve health, and, secondly, should link up with global efforts to address specific conditions.\n</p><p>Responsibility for the implementation of ENRH was primarily located at the level of low and middle income countries themselves \u2013 particularly through setting priorities for health research and health research systems, and through \u2013 what can now be termed \u2013 as generating an environment conducive to research.  In addition, countries were asked to invest 2% of their national health budget in health research.\n</p><p>Research Capacity Strengthening. Strengthening the research capacity of developing nations, including its individuals, institutions and the research system as a whole.\n</p><p><b>2.\tCreating international research partnerships</b>\nThe international community, its institutions and research organisations in high income countries were also given specific responsibilities. The report outlines many different lines of investigation that were neglected at the time \u2013 some of which are still neglected now. It also emphasized the need for international networking and the support of epidemiological and social science research to achieve health. It also called on the international community to support research capacity building in low and middle income countries.\n</p><p><b>3.\tMobilizing funding to support health research for development.</b> In addition to calling on developing countries to spend 2% of their national health budgets on health research, the Commission called on donors to allocate 5% of all aid given in the health sector to health research and towards building health research capacity. Other recommendations were made, but this section remains the most underdeveloped of the Commission\u2019s report. Although calls for \u2018innovative financing mechanisms\u2019 were made, no specifics were provided.\n</p><p><b>4.\tEstablishing a forum in which progress towards reducing the \u201810/90 gap\u2019 can be monitored.</b> The fourth recommendation concerns the establishment of an \u2018international mechanism\u2019 to communicate progress and, if needed, to mobilize more finances for health research for development. This \u2018mechanism\u2019 should be \u2018independent\u2019 \u2013 with which was meant that it should act as a stimulus for others to do research not as a research organisation itself. Such a forum would bring together researchers, donors, governments and other <a href=\"/wiki/Stakeholder_(corporate)\" title=\"Stakeholder (corporate)\">stakeholders</a> on an annual basis to monitor health research for development.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Follow-up_action\">Follow-up action</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Commission_on_Health_Research_for_Development&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Follow-up action\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The Commission tabled its report in September 1990 during a meeting at the <a href=\"/wiki/Karolinska_Institute\" title=\"Karolinska Institute\">Karolinska Institute</a> in <a href=\"/wiki/Sweden\" title=\"Sweden\">Sweden</a>. The meeting brought together many of the people who had been active in or interviewed by the Commission and its Secretariat. The report was widely endorsed, and to ensure that action would not stop with the end of the Commission\u2019s work, a Task Force on Health Research for Development was initiated.\n</p><p>The Task Force on Health Research for Development was active from the end of the work of the Commission in 1990 until the establishment of a permanent body to take some of the Commission\u2019s work forward, the Council on Health Research for Development (COHRED).\n</p><p><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.cohred.org\">COHRED</a>, took over where the Task Force left off. COHRED\u2019s primary responsibility became, firstly, advocacy for Essential National Health Research (ENHR) and, secondly, strengthening research capacity in low and middle income countries. Provided with an extremely meagre budget compared to current \u2018global health partnerships\u2019, COHRED was nevertheless instrumental in promoting research priority setting in low and middle income countries. It brought the message of ENHR to countries across the world, evolving today to support countries' development of research capacity and national research systems for health.\n</p><p>COHRED was established in the administrative environment of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) rather than in the World Health Organization (WHO). This emphasizes a key characteristic of the organisation - its focus is development \u2013 and the way to get there includes promotion of research and research systems for health, equity and development. in 2002, COHRED became an independent international non-governmental organisation. See the pages on COHRED or Council on Health Research for Development for more information. \n</p><p>The fourth recommendation became the basis for the establishment of the <a href=\"/wiki/Global_Forum_for_Health_Research\" title=\"Global Forum for Health Research\">Global Forum for Health Research</a>, which was created in 1997.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Commission_on_Health_Research_for_Development&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-hr_final_report-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\">^ <a href=\"#cite_ref-hr_final_report_1-0\"><sup><i><b>a</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-hr_final_report_1-1\"><sup><i><b>b</b></i></sup></a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><cite class=\"citation web\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.cohred.org/downloads/open_archive/ComReports_0.pdf\">\"<i>Health Research: Essential Link to Equity in Development</i>\"</a> <span style=\"font-size:85%;\">(PDF)</span>.
