Plastic soup is an increasingly widely used term referring to pollution of the environment by plastics in general, ranging from large pieces of fishing gear that can entrap marine animals to the microplastics and nanoplastics that result from the breakdown or photodegradation of plastic waste in surface waters, rivers or oceans.  The most notorious example of this pollution is the Great Pacific Garbage Patch (lots more on the science of the subject there), an area in which marine debris has accumulated in an ocean gyre. It should be pointed out that the density even in that region does not correspond to the public image of floating islands of rubbish; the concentrations are however high enough to be of considerable environmental concern.
