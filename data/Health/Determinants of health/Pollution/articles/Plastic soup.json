It should be pointed out that the density even in that region does not correspond to the public image of floating islands of rubbish; the concentrations are however high enough to be of considerable environmental concern.\n</p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw2169\nCached time: 20180918185939\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.000 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.006 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 1/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 0/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 1/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:16317992-0!canonical and timestamp 20180918185939 and revision id 847362758\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","*":"Pollution"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Plastics"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Pacific_Ocean"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Great Pacific garbage patch"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Microplastics"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Ocean gyre"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Photodegradation"},{"ns":0,"*":"Nanoplastics"}],"templates":[],"images":[],"externallinks":[],"sections":[],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Plastic soup","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q55951346"}]}}
