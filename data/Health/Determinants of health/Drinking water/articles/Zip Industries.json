An early Zip innovation was a manually operated over-sink boiling water heater with a \"ready whistle\" and automatic cut-off, which became a popular fixture in Australian restaurants and community kitchens during the 1950s and 1960s. The company was acquired by Crouch in 1962.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Product_development\">Product development</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Zip_Industries&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Product development\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>During the 1960s, Zip expanded its range of over-sink boiling water heaters (in capacities of 9 to 45&#160;litres) catering for canteen, restaurant, factory and office kitchens needing high volumes of boiling water for tea, coffee and cooking. Larger capacity boiling water heaters were also manufactured for use in dairies.\n</p><p>By 1970, Zip also installed the world's first \"boiling water tap\" \u2013 a boiling water tap (faucet) installed beside standard hot and cold taps. It provided steaming boiling water from an under-sink pressurised cylinder containing water heated to above boiling point. To conform to the safety maintenance requirements of Australian Standards, these models were superseded subsequently by unpressurised systems emitting minimal steam. \n</p><p>By 1975, Zip complemented its early over-sink boiling water heaters with its first on-wall instant boiling water heaters with enhanced energy efficiency and an increased capacity measured in number of cups of boiling water per hour. These were followed closely by the introduction of the <b>Zip Miniboil</b>, the first truly small on-wall instant boiling water heater. It was a practical, space-saving addition to the smaller office or home kitchen. The Zip Miniboil was followed closely by the <b>Zip Tea Tap</b>, an under-sink, non-pressurized instant boiling water system. It delivered water within one degree of boiling point, with little or no steam, or the spatter, which characterised both the early Zip \"boiling water tap\" and some later boiling water systems, still marketed by competitors in the United Kingdom and Europe. The Zip Tea Tap originated a patented steam condensing system to eliminate the emission of excessive steam in conjunction with boiling water. By 1985, Zip Tea Tap was so well accepted in Australia that it was specified for all of the kitchens and Members' offices in the new Parliament House, Canberra, officially opened in 1988. \n</p><p>In the early 1990s, Zip introduced a range of advanced on-wall instant boiling water heaters under the <b>Zip Hydroboil</b> brand. These were far more compact, energy-efficient and easier to service than any existing equivalents. Zip Hydroboil models storing between 1.5 and 7.5&#160;litres were produced for workplace kitchens, whilst models storing 15 to 40&#160;litres were produced for restaurant, canteen and institutional kitchens needing higher water volumes. The Zip Hydroboil range has been refined and expanded since, including the introduction in 2008 of electronically controlled models able to maintain boiling water temperature within 0.2&#160;\u00b0C of set temperature.\n</p><p>By 1996, Zip introduced air-cooled <b>Zip HydroTap</b> under-bench filtered instant boiling water systems which also dispensed filtered chilled drinking water from a single touch-button electronic tap \u2013 an instant success for workplace and home kitchens in Australia and abroad. By 2004, the initial Zip HydroTap was superseded by re-designed product engineering and a distinctive lever-action electronic tap offering precise water flow control, safety, and power-saving features, plus a \"font\" accessory which enabled the tap to be positioned away from any sink, with independent drainage. The new Zip HydroTap proved popular worldwide. It has been improved each year. Models introduced in 2012 provide sparkling chilled and filtered drinking water (in addition to boiling and chilled) from one tap.\n</p><p>Another recent Zip innovation, the <b>Zip HydroTap All-In-One</b>, also launched in 2012, gives boiling, chilled and sparkling filtered water plus hot and cold water, from a single source and outlet.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Global_expansion\">Global expansion</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Zip_Industries&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Global expansion\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Zip manufacturing facilities and head office are located in Sydney, Australia, and Australian made Zip products are now marketed in more than seventy countries. Distributors throughout the South-East Asia were first established in 1982 and 1983. A distributor for Great Britain was engaged in 1987, and instant boiling water systems were exhibited for the first time in Europe when Zip first participated in Europe's Domotechnika and ISH trade shows in 1989 and 1991.\n</p><p>In 1991, Zip Heaters (UK) Limited was formed to take over UK distribution, and a distributor for Europe, based in Germany, was appointed in 2002. More recently, distributors were appointed in China and a Zip company, Zenith Heaters, became responsible for distribution in New Zealand.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Business_development\">Business development</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Zip_Industries&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Business development\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In addition to its Australian-made range of instant boiling water products, Zip Industries also markets:\n</p>\n<ul><li>water chillers and filtered drinking water systems under the Zip brand,</li>\n<li>catering industry boiling water products (including portable electric urns) under the Birko brand,</li>\n<li>retail \u201cfood service\u201d boiling and chilled water systems under the Instanta brand, and</li>\n<li>electronically controlled \u201cpoint of use\u201d instant hot water systems under the Zip brand.</li></ul>\n<p>A range of Zip touch-free washroom products includes touch-free sensor taps for hand-basins, thermostatic mixing valves for delivery of temperature-controlled water for hand-basins, baths and showers, touch-free automatic hand dryers, and touch-free flushing systems for pan toilets and urinals.
