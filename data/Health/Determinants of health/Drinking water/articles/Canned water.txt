Canned water is drinking water packaged in tin cans or beverage cans, a less common alternative to bottled water. Canned water is used primarily where storage or distribution systems are set up for cans, or when canning systems are used to make emergency water supplies. Recently, some companies have launched water in cans as a more sustainable alternative to plastic bottles.  Water was stored in steel cans, lined with plastic bags, under the United States Civil Defense program. Approximately twelve million 17.5-US-gallon (66Â L) cans were deployed, and could hold water for more than ten years.  Later, some manufacturers started to use Nitrogen flush to remove air and bacteria from their cans to prolong shelf life to 30 years or longer, making the water suitable for long term storage.
