A fitness trail, outdoor exercise equipment, or parcourse, consists of a path or course equipped with obstacles or stations distributed along its length for exercising the human body to promote good health.  The course is designed to promote physical fitness training in the style attributed to Georges HÃ©bert.  In general, fitness trails can be natural or man-made, located in areas such as forest, transportation rights-of-way, parks, or urban settings.  Equipment exists to provide specific forms of physiological exercise, and can consist of natural features including climbable rocks, trees, and river embankments, or manufactured products (stepping posts, chin-up and climbing bars) designed to provide similar physical challenges.  The degree of difficulty of a course is determined by terrain slope, trail surface (dirt, grass, gravel, etc.), obstacle height (walls) or length (crawls) and other features.  Urban parcourses tend to be flat, to permit participation by the elderly, and to accommodate cyclists, runners, skaters and walking. The new concept of an outdoor gym, containing traditional gym equipment specifically designed for outdoor use, is also considered to be a development of the parcourse. These outdoor exercise gyms include moving parts and are often made from galvanised metal. The original parcours was invented in 1968 by Swiss architect Erwin Weckemann with support from Swiss life insurance firm Vita. The first course was built in Zurich, Switzerland.   Hundreds of courses were built in Europe by 1972.  Courses built in ensuing years included: Fitness Trails can include stations for the upper body, lower body, balance & coordination and climbing/jumping equipment designed to test the whole body. Installations are found across AU. East Bay North Bay San Francisco Peninsula South Bay Waters of France Company, distributor of Perrier water. The circuit includes eighteen exercise stations spaced over a 2.5 mile path.
