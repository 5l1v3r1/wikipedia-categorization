By adhering to cyclic training the body is given adequate time to recover from significant stress before additional training is undertaken. The response to a new stress is to first respond poorly and the response drops off. For example when the body is first exposed to sun a sunburn might develop. During the resistance stage adaptation improves the response to a higher level, called super compensation, than the previous equilibrium. The example would be that a suntan develops. The exhaustion stage is a continuation of the stimulus at too high a level and the increase gained from adaptation is now offset and all gains are lost. The example would be that wrinkles, spots, or even skin cancer develop. The goal in sports periodization is to reduce the stress at the point where the resistance stage ends so the body has time to recover. In this way the exhaustion stage does not reduce the gains achieved, the body can recover and remain above the original equilibrium point. The next cycle of increased stimulus now improves the response further and the equilibrium point continues to rise after each cycle.\n</p><p>Selye (1957) labeled beneficial stresses as \"<a href=\"/wiki/Eustress\" title=\"Eustress\">eustress</a>\" and detrimental stresses as \"distress\". In athletics, when physical stress is at a healthy level (eustress), an athlete experiences muscular strength and growth, while excessive physical stress (distress) can lead to tissue damage, disease, and death. Periodization is most widely used in resistance program design to avoid over-training and to systematically alternate high loads of training with decreased loading phases to improve components of muscular fitness (e.g. strength, strength-speed, and strength-endurance). The Selye-cycles are similar to the \"micro cycles\" used at later times.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Russia\" title=\"Russia\">Russian</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Physiologist\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Physiologist\">physiologist</a> <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Leo_Matveyev&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Leo Matveyev (page does not exist)\">Leo Matveyev</a> and Romanian sport scientist <a href=\"/wiki/Tudor_Bompa\" title=\"Tudor Bompa\">Tudor Bompa</a> expanded and further organized the periodization model. Matveyev has been regarded as the father of modern periodization. He analysed the results of the Soviet athletes of the 1952 and 1956 summer Olympics and compared successful and not so successful athletes and their training schedules. From these training plans periodized schedules were developed for the 1960 Olympics. With the success of the Soviet athletes, Matveyev's plans were spread all over the Eastern  Bloc in their annual coordination meetings. From there it also spread to Romania, where <a href=\"/wiki/Tudor_Bompa\" title=\"Tudor Bompa\">Tudor Bompa</a> developed the system further.

The microcycle is generally up to 7 days. The mesocycle may be anywhere from 2 weeks to a few months, but is typically a month. A macrocycle refers to the overall training period, usually representing a year or two. There are longer cycles as well for the Olympian, being 4 or 8 years, and the career plan which is usually only considered for Olympians and professional athletes.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Theory_of_planning\">Theory of planning</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Sports_periodization&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Theory of planning\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Training should be organized and planned in advance of a competition or performance.\nIt should consider the <a href=\"/wiki/Sportsperson\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sportsperson\">athlete</a>\u2019s potential, his/her performance in tests or <a href=\"/wiki/Competition\" title=\"Competition\">competition</a>, and calendar of competition.

The preparation phase is further broken up into general and specific preparation of which general preparation takes over half. An example of general preparation would be building an <a href=\"/wiki/Aerobic_exercise\" title=\"Aerobic exercise\">aerobic base</a> for an <a href=\"/wiki/Endurance_sports\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Endurance sports\">endurance athlete</a> such as running on a <a href=\"/wiki/Treadmill\" title=\"Treadmill\">treadmill</a> and learning any rules or regulations that would be required such as proper <a href=\"/wiki/Swimming_(sport)\" title=\"Swimming (sport)\">swimming</a> stroke as not to be disqualified. An example of specific preparation would be to work on the proper form to be more efficient and to work more on the final format of the sport, which is to move from the treadmill to the <a href=\"/wiki/Road_surface\" title=\"Road surface\">pavement</a>.\n</p><p>The competitive phase can be several competitions, but they lead up to the main competition with specific tests. Testing might include any of the following: performance level, new shoes or gear, a new race tactic might be employed, pre-race meals, ways to reduce <a href=\"/wiki/Anxiety\" title=\"Anxiety\">anxiety</a> before a race, or the length needed for the taper. When the pre-competitions are of a higher priority there is a definite taper stage while lower priority might simply be integrated in as training. The competitive phase ends with the taper and the competition.\n</p><p>The transition phase is important for <a href=\"/wiki/Psychology\" title=\"Psychology\">psychological</a> reasons, a year of training means a vacation is in order.

This is largely due to the over simplified assumptions put forward in the early development of periodization theory that are not always transferable to the psyco-biological effects of various training methods used in sport. <sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p><br />\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Tactical_Periodization\">Tactical Periodization</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Sports_periodization&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11\" title=\"Edit section: Tactical Periodization\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>For many years, football training and its planning has been (and still is) characterised by fragmented thinking of which has perhaps been attributed to the success of such an approach in individual sports. The emphasis of planning and improvement was mainly in regards to the physical attributes of strength, speed and endurance <sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>. Furtheremore, whether it be the undulating model, the reverse linear model or the traditional periodization framework, one of the underpinning assumptions is that it would be best to segregate the programme into distinct training blocks in a sequential hierarchy i.e. a training block to build endurance before speed and strength before power. This is claimed to be based on the \u2018science of periodization\u2019. However, Kiely <sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>, argues that the proof on which this is all based on is flawed because the studies used to build this proof have only \u2018compared training interventions with no training variation to those with degrees of variation\u2019  but did not offer any insight \u2018into how that variation is best scheduled and organised\u2019 (Kiely, 2010, p.4). So although it is commonly agreed that training variation is an important design feature which needs to be integrated into the training plan, there is \u2018little or no supporting evidence\u2019 which proves that the segregation of the program into distinct training blocks or that there should be sequential hierarchy of how this should be done is in fact advantageous.\n</p><p>Many authors such as Garganta, Maia, &amp; Marque <sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>, Oliviera <sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>, Castelo <sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup>, and Gaiteiro <sup id=\"cite_ref-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup> have argued in regards to the indivisibility of the 4 components which make up a football performance...technical, tactical, physical and mental. This complexity makes football a multidimensional phenomenon which cannot be simply reduced to the sum of its parts. Is defending more important than attacking or vice versa? This question cannot be answered as football needs to be understood as a whole. As highlighted by Tamarit <sup id=\"cite_ref-14\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup>, football is a tactical game where players are constantly required to make decisions in response to specific situations. So football needs to be viewed as a tactical game which encompasses with it the physical,technical and mental aspects required for positive performances.  This is the foundation upon which Victor Frade developed a training methodology known as tactical periodisation which emphasises the development of the tactical dimension. Therefore, any physical, technical or mental development must always have a tactical intention. In other words, although the ability to run for 90 minutes may seem vital to play the game, knowing when, where and how to run is much more important. \n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Sports_periodization&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap mw-references-columns\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-Rowbottom-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-Rowbottom_1-0\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><cite class=\"citation book\">Rowbottom, David J.
