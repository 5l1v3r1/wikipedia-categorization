Shovelgloving is a form of physical exercise based around use of a sledgehammer that has been wrapped in a sweater or otherwise padded.  The shovelglove is used to perform shoveling, butter churning and wood chopping motions, amongst others. These natural movements are intended to be part of a functional training program. Reinhard Engels, the inventor of Shovelgloving, advocates Shovelgloving for 14 minutes per day. He explains the rationale for 14 minutes as follows:  "It's one minute less than the smallest unit of schedulistically significant time. No calendar has a finer granularity than 15 minutes. No one ever has a meeting that starts at 5 or 10 or 14 minutes before or after the hour. You have no excuse not to do this. Time-wise, it doesn't even register." He recommends beginners start with less than 14 minutes, however. Reinhard Engels has been interviewed about Shovelgloving by the Healthy Planet Show  broadcast on WAIF 88.3 FM in Cincinnati.
