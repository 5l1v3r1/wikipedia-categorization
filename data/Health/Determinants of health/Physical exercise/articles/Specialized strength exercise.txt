Specialized strength exercises are physical exercises used to develop the physical or psychological qualities that apply directly to a specific sport discipline. These exercises are designed and selected so that the movement and actions closely match those seen in a specific sport.  Specialized exercises that promote psychological traits consist of movements and actions that require decisiveness, willpower, perseverance and confidence to achieve specific goals.  They have similar concentration and psychological qualities as seen during competition.    For example, execution of certain specialized exercises requires concentration to develop the neuromuscular pathway needed.  A strength exercise which duplicates a particular portion of a skill requires ultimate concentration and perseverance to repeat exactly the same movement time after time to develop the necessary muscle feel.   For the specialized exercises to have maximum positive transfer an athlete must be decisive in their movements and actions in order to develop the confidence to repeat the action during competition.  For an exercise to be specific it must fulfill one or more of the following criteria:   The key to improving your performance is to do general exercises to develop a base and to then do special exercises that duplicate the movements and actions seen in the actual skills execution.  In this way the development of the physical abilities that are specific to a sport will have the greatest impact on maintaining or improving an athlete's ability to perform better.
