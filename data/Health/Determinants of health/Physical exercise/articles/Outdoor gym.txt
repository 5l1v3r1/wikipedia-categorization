The outdoor gym is a gym built outside in a public park, with the all-weather construction of its exercise machines somewhat modeled on playground equipment.  It is similar to the 1960s–1970s proliferation of fitness trails, which continue to be created particularly in the USA and Europe.  In some instances, trails used for fitness are referred to as outdoor gyms.  Types of outdoor gym equipment may vary according to the nature of parks, locality and the visitors. There is no fixed list as which can include all of the machines or fixtures used in different parts of the world for outdoor recreation. These fixtures or machines can also be categorized into strength training and simple fitness or resistance training. Some basic outdoor exercising installations used commonly all over the world are pullup bars, balancing beams, parallel dip bars, etc.  Outdoor gyms have been used in China as a national fitness campaign prior to the 2008 Summer Olympics.
