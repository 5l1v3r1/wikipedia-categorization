He and two <a href=\"/wiki/United_States_Navy\" title=\"United States Navy\">Navy</a> buddies, all wrestlers, were exploring <a href=\"/wiki/Shanghai\" title=\"Shanghai\">Shanghai</a> and were amazed by an 80-year-old rickshaw man\u2019s ability to pull a wide <a href=\"/wiki/Pulled_rickshaw\" title=\"Pulled rickshaw\">rickshaw</a> with the three muscular seamen up and down the steep hills of Shanghai. Johnson pursued the slight Chinese man who eventually led him to the slender, regal Grand Master. Upon meeting Dr. Ch\u2019eng at his home in Shanghai, the tall, 235-pound 19-year-old was unable to take down the 130&#160;lb.  Ch\u2019eng who, seemingly inexplicably, fended him off and left him lying on the floor after each of three increasingly aggressive advances. He used an ancient \u201cspinning\u201d technique. Johnson, convinced that he had to learn everything this man could teach, was soon accepted as a student by Ch\u2019eng, who was no doubt impressed and amused by the young headstrong man\u2019s potential and enthusiasm for learning all he could.  Eventually Dr. Ch\u2019eng, having lost his sons in the war between China and Japan, trusted Johnson enough to pass on the knowledge and techniques he would need to become the next Grand Master.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Bruce_L._Johnson_3-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Bruce_L._Johnson-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Biography_of_Grand_Master_Bruce_L._Johnson\">Biography of Grand Master Bruce L.

Health and <a href=\"/wiki/Physical_fitness\" title=\"Physical fitness\">physical fitness</a> became a lifelong passion, as well as a quest to stay young and embrace Nature.\n</p><p>After high school, during <a href=\"/wiki/World_War_II\" title=\"World War II\">World War II</a>,  the handsome blue-eyed, black-haired (of Swedish and Iroquois descent) Johnson became a <a href=\"/wiki/Navy\" title=\"Navy\">Navy</a> heavyweight wrestling champion<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> who excelled in physical exploits and competitions.

But because of <a href=\"/wiki/McCarthyism\" title=\"McCarthyism\">McCarthyism</a> and the fear of <a href=\"/wiki/Communism\" title=\"Communism\">Communism</a>, there was little enthusiasm about anything Asian. Few showed interest in learning the unusual, oriental exercises.\n</p><p>Meanwhile, wanderlust led Johnson around the world finding work, often on ships.

Wherever he went in the world, he sought out others who might have heard of Chinese Wand, even placing ads in local papers. But he never found anyone. As far as he knew, he was the only one who knew about it.  Johnson spent time in <a href=\"/wiki/Hollywood\" title=\"Hollywood\">Hollywood</a> and found a small group of <a href=\"/wiki/Health_food\" title=\"Health food\">health food</a> and fitness enthusiasts such as <a href=\"/wiki/Mae_West\" title=\"Mae West\">Mae West</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Jimmy_Durante\" title=\"Jimmy Durante\">Jimmy Durante</a>, and others who became students.<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> It has been rumored that he might have been the inspiration for the song \u201c<a href=\"/wiki/Nature_Boy\" title=\"Nature Boy\">Nature Boy</a>\u201d (popularized by <a href=\"/wiki/Nat_King_Cole\" title=\"Nat King Cole\">Nat King Cole</a>) when he claimed he spent time with the songwriter, <a href=\"/wiki/Eden_Ahbez\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Eden Ahbez\">Eden Ahbez</a>.

A fourth child was killed. Armed with only a pointed shell he grabbed on the beach, he fought the beast a full five minutes underwater, his leg in its mouth until he jabbed its eye with the shell and was able to escape, barely making it to shore.<sup id=\"cite_ref-The_Secret_Strength_14-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-The_Secret_Strength-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup> He won international acclaim and was honored by heads of three governments.<sup id=\"cite_ref-15\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>He caused another sensation in 1966 when he and a friend (who later became his wife) volunteered to spend an unspecified amount of time on an uninhabited <a href=\"/wiki/Fiji\" title=\"Fiji\">Fiji Island</a> with no supplies, only bathing suits and camera equipment. Learning too late that the island was far from idyllic limited their stay to 40 days, but caused national publicity.<sup id=\"cite_ref-16\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-16\">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Dramatic adventures seemed to follow the elusive Johnson who often found himself at the right place in time to rescue others from extreme danger (over 50 documented at the risk of his own life) including fires, mangled cars, even abusive husbands.\n</p><p>Johnson rarely spoke of his powers as a <a href=\"/wiki/Mysticism\" title=\"Mysticism\">mystic</a>. Students would sometimes notice <a href=\"/wiki/Supernatural\" title=\"Supernatural\">supernatural</a> transformations in his appearance as he taught the class.  He was inclined to believe that Dr. Ch\u2019eng was teaching through him. One famous <a href=\"/wiki/Psychic\" title=\"Psychic\">psychic</a> of his day, <a href=\"/wiki/Peter_Hurkos\" title=\"Peter Hurkos\">Peter Hurkos</a>, upon meeting Johnson said, \u201cWho is that beautiful Chinese man coming out of you?\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-Joe_Rafferty_9-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Joe_Rafferty-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Others saw Johnson transform: after a class in <a href=\"/wiki/Eureka,_California\" title=\"Eureka, California\">Eureka, California</a>, a young student \u201casked him if he knew that he had become transformed into a Chinese person while he was performing the wand exercises. . .Did you see it too?...\u201d another classmate added.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Joe_Rafferty_9-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Joe_Rafferty-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>It has also been said that the late Dr. Ch'eng's formidable, otherworldly presence was physically tangible, gentle, even erotic.\n</p><p>Enthusiasm for Chinese Wand was minimal until a nationwide curiosity in <a href=\"/wiki/Eastern_philosophy\" title=\"Eastern philosophy\">Eastern philosophy</a> erupted in the 1960s, beginning with the <a href=\"/wiki/Beatles\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Beatles\">Beatles</a>\u2019 trip to <a href=\"/wiki/India\" title=\"India\">India</a> and the subsequent publicity. Interest in meditation techniques, <a href=\"/wiki/Yoga\" title=\"Yoga\">yoga</a>, martial arts, and other esoteric practices spiked.  At last, Johnson was able to develop classes. Eventually, he self-published a book in 1975.\n</p><p>In December 1976, Johnson, who also worked as a professional diver, was seriously injured in an underwater accident and sustained a near-fatal brain stem infarct causing <a href=\"/wiki/Stroke_symptoms\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Stroke symptoms\">stroke-like symptoms</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Mary_Jane_Hunter_5-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Mary_Jane_Hunter-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> Initially told he would never walk again, he once again defied odds and within a matter of months,  was walking and looking as healthy as ever.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Karen_Kaye_13-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Karen_Kaye-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Although still reeling from lingering and painful after-effects of the trauma, he managed to generate interest from a major publisher (<a href=\"/wiki/William_Morrow_and_Company\" title=\"William Morrow and Company\">William Morrow</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/New_York_City\" title=\"New York City\">New York</a>) who published his book in hardcover in 1977.\n</p><p>During the time he was striving to regain his health, he underwent a  <a href=\"/wiki/Christian\" title=\"Christian\">Christian</a> \u201c<a href=\"/wiki/Born-again\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Born-again\">born-again</a>\u201d experience that eventually influenced his thinking and upended his belief system. He slowly rejected a <a href=\"/wiki/Holistic\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Holistic\">holistic</a> awareness of consciousness and abandoned his lifelong allegiance to preserving and re-introducing the teachings of Dr. Ch\u2019eng and the art of Chinese Wand.  The spreading of a popular desire to learn the more violent aspects of martial arts and the potential \u201cdanger\u201d of involvement with the <a href=\"/wiki/Supernatural\" title=\"Supernatural\">supernatural</a> conflicted with his newfound <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Ultra-conservative&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Ultra-conservative (page does not exist)\">ultra-conservative</a> Christian views. Efforts to promote Chinese Wand diminished and eventually disappeared from public view.\n</p><p>\u201c--Oriental philosophy is at their [martial arts] heart,\u201d Johnson says. \u201cThese things are not from <a href=\"/wiki/God\" title=\"God\">God</a>, as God is not in the business of <a href=\"/wiki/Mystical\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Mystical\">mystical</a> energies or the <a href=\"/wiki/Occult\" title=\"Occult\">occult</a>. . .I no longer practice the martial arts \u2026as a Christian, I cannot in good conscience, teach or recommend the martial arts to others.\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-17\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-17\">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chinese_Wand_Today\">Chinese Wand Today</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Chinese_Wand_Exercise&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Chinese Wand Today\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Even though Johnson\u2019s book is no longer in print, the web and <a href=\"/wiki/YouTube\" title=\"YouTube\">YouTube</a> videos are generating a resurgence of the practice in the U.S. and the U.K. in particular. A new generation of students are learning what they can from Johnson\u2019s book, sometimes by changing the name slightly (e.g. `Chi Stix', 'Stick Yoga,' or `<a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Jian_Gan&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Jian Gan (page does not exist)\">Jian Gan</a> - Chinese Health Wand') to avoid copyright infringement on Johnson's original text.\n</p><p>Sadly, it appears that Johnson did not train anyone to carry on this unique art as the next Grand Master.

He wanted his book to be in every nursing home, every hospital, every physical therapy room, every doctor's office for the doctor to prescribe the exercises to patients - in every home so families could practice together; he also hoped that workers in offices and factories could practice the exercises together to increase productivity and health of workforce and that physical fitness instructors in schools and colleges would adopt the system.\n<sup id=\"cite_ref-Bruce_L._Johnson_3-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Bruce_L._Johnson-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Some in the Chinese martial arts and Qigong community are now taking a serious interest in the Chinese Wand and promoting its use as a social exercise the way Johnson envisaged.
