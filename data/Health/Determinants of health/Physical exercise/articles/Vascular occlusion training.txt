Blood flow restriction training abbreviated BFR training) or Occlusion Training is an exercise approach involving using a training device called the Occlusion Cuff (www.occlusioncuff.com)which is applied to proximal aspect of the muscle to reduce venous return from the limb, which causes venous pooling. Longer terms also include blood flow moderation exercise or vascular occlusion moderation training. VOT and the related methods have gained popularity mainly as an alternative to the progressive load principle in hypertrophy-specific weight training, [unreliable source?]  although more recent studies show superior results compared with straightforward strength training.  VOT is nevertheless suggested as a possible solution to acquire muscular hypertrophy in "stubborn" body parts such as calves. [medical citation needed] Although following similar dynamics, VOT has two different modes of inducing occlusion on the vasculature. The first method involves applying a simple tourniquet proximal to a muscle. Yet another method is the technique of manipulating muscle contraction.  When using belts and lifting straps for tourniquet, the amount of pressure on the vasculature cannot be controlled and there are reports of rhabdomyolysis cases due to VOT.  Sato himself risked his life in 1967 after uncontrolled sessions of VOT, leading him to focus more on control and adjustment of the pressure applied on the vasculature.
