A wide variety of physical and other benefits are claimed for rebound exercise, which experienced a tremendous upsurge of interest<sup id=\"cite_ref-articlesphere_2-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-articlesphere-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> in the mid-1980s. A rebound exercise program can focus on <a href=\"/wiki/Aerobics\" title=\"Aerobics\">aerobics</a>, strength, or just simple easy non-jarring movement, depending on the needs of the person bouncing.\n</p><p>Typically round, rebounders are much smaller (at about 3 to 4 feet in total diameter) than regular trampolines, and they are not designed for stunts. Other equipment for one or two feet, such as Kangoo Jumps or BOSU balls, can provide a type of rebound exercise experience, and regular, full-size, sports or athletic trampolines can also be used to perform the various movements, routines, programs, and styles that characterize rebound exercise. Rebounders are predominantly used solo in personal homes, but are also found in some health clubs, and physical rehabilitation centers.\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#History\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">History</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Equipment\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Equipment</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Types_of_exercise_and_movements_performed\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Types of exercise and movements performed</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Claimed_benefits\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Claimed benefits</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#NASA_study_and_scientific_support_generally\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">NASA study and scientific support generally</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"History\">History</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Rebound_exercise&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: History\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The modern trampoline was created by George Nissen in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in 1936.<sup id=\"cite_ref-google_3-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-google-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> In 1938 the first \u201csmall trampoline\u201d was created by Ed Russell, who left his ideas and prototype with Victor Green, who patented the \u201csmall trampoline\u201d in 1975.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>  Within a year, five American companies were manufacturing small trampolines, which were soon called rebounders.\n</p><p>In part because of business promotional efforts, and in part because of a number of scientific studies that seemed to support the value of rebounding (see \u201cScientific Studies\u201d below), from 1981 to 1984 rebound exercise became very popular in the United States, with reportedly over one million units selling a year. The fad faded by the end of 1984, supposedly because poor quality foreign-made units had flooded the U.S. market.\n</p><p>Today, there appears to be an upsurge of interest in rebound exercise, in part due to increasing quality of equipment and in part due to its use in physical therapy and the fight against obesity generally. Rebound exercise is especially popular in holistic health circles, as rebounding is said to combat a number of ailments (see \u201cClaimed Benefits\u201d below) given its ability to generally and gently stimulate the immune system and provide aerobic exercise without jarring the physical structures of the body as the elastic element of the rebounder is said to take up to 85% of the shock that the body would otherwise experience.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Equipment\">Equipment</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Rebound_exercise&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Equipment\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Rebounders are often called \u201cmini-trampolines,\u201d but this is a misnomer. Trampolines are generally much larger, and are designed to perform stunts such as flips and seat drops, while it is dangerous to perform stunts on rebounders. While there are \u201cdouble mini-trampolines\u201d used in sports and even Olympic competition, these are designed specifically to perform stunts and are used in a substantially different manner than is the typical rebounder.\n</p><p>Most but not all rebounders are round, and consist of the following parts:\n</p>\n<ul><li>6 legs between 8 and 14\u201d long</li>\n<li>a durable mat with an elastic nature</li>\n<li>an elastic element such as spring or bungee bands</li>\n<li>a round elevated rim which the legs support and which is attached to the mat by the elastic element, either springs or bungee bands</li></ul>\n<p>Since their introduction, many improvements have been made to the quality and construction of rebounders. Spring size, shape, and durability have improved greatly over time, and in the last several years springs have been replaced entirely in certain high-end units by bungee-bands, which are quieter and may also offer certain advantages in terms of smoothness and user experience. Units with folding legs, and units whose entire body (including the mat and the rim) folds in half, or even in quarters, have been introduced. Rebounders can be purchased for anywhere from between $40 and $1,000 and up.\n</p><p>The largest two differences between rebounders, other than manufacturing materials, relate to the source of elasticity.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> As this mechanism is responsible for carrying the weight of the user, their longevity and responsiveness directly affect the rebounding experience. The two main mechanisms currently in production are bungee cords<sup id=\"cite_ref-Bungee_cord_rebounders_6-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Bungee_cord_rebounders-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> and piano wire.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Piano_wire_rebounders_7-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Piano_wire_rebounders-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Types_of_exercise_and_movements_performed\">Types of exercise and movements performed</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Rebound_exercise&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Types of exercise and movements performed\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Rebound exercise begins as soon as someone steps on a rebounder and begins to move their body. It can be highly aerobic \u2014 full-on sprints and interval training are ideal on a rebounder, because it does not jar the physical body anywhere near as much as does hard ground \u2014 or it can be very slow and gentle, with only a gentle rocking taking place.\n</p><p>Just as rebounders have evolved from poorly made spring-based units to modern spring-based units and high-end bungee-based units, the types of exercise and movement done on rebounders has evolved as well.\n</p><p>Al Carter initially introduced the distinction between the \u201chealth bounce\u201d (a gentle rocking motion that anyone in any state of health can do, which was said to stimulate the immune system), an \u201caerobic bounce\u201d that involved elevating the heart rate (either running in place or dancing), and the \u201cstrength bounce,\u201d which involved higher bouncing with both feet leaving the mat (leading to both abdominal and lower body strength directly as well as to the strengthening of all bodily cells through the accelerative force applied (see Claimed Benefits below).\n</p><p>Subsequently, many different approaches have been taken to rebounding. For example, collaborating with Al Carter and working with athletes in the late 1970s and 1980s, Dr. Harry Sneider, a college athletic coach, brought his sport-specific training methods and the use of resistive hand-weights to rebound exercise.<sup id=\"cite_ref-drfit_8-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-drfit-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>  More recently, JB Burns has pioneered an infomercial and mass equipment approach making use of dance-style workout DVDs for home users. Along the way, a variety of celebrities have endorsed rebounding, including the fitness guru Jack LaLane and the self-help guru Tony Robbins. Bob Hope reportedly said, \u201c\u201cI keep my REBOUNDER at the foot of my bed, and use it daily,\u201d and President Ronald Reagan reportedly said, \u201cIf you see somebody jumping up and down on the second floor of the White House, that's me rebounding.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-reboundersgov_9-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-reboundersgov-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Claimed_benefits\">Claimed benefits</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Rebound_exercise&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Claimed benefits\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>There are five main organizing themes or perspectives with respect to what is claimed<sup id=\"cite_ref-Rebounder_health_benefits_10-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Rebounder_health_benefits-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> [doubtful source: trampoline sales site] to be special about the health and fitness benefits of rebound exercise:\n</p>\n<ul><li><b>Strengthened Cells</b>: All of the body\u2019s cells are said to be strengthened through the mechanics of rebounding, either because of gravity changes or because of pressure differentials (along with more oxygen reaching cells throughout the body);</li>\n<li><b>Increased Lymph Flow &amp; Immune System Function</b>: Rebounding is said to lead to greatly increased lymph fluid circulation, leading directly to a boosted immune system, greater white blood cell activity, and increased detoxification generally;</li>\n<li><b>Cardiovascular and Respiratory Improvement</b>: Rebounding is said to directly yield impressive aerobic exercise benefits in terms of heart strength and functioning, respiration, and related physiological functions; and</li>\n<li><b>Physical Strength, Muscular Development, Coordination, Balance, and Flexibility</b>: Rebounding is often said to improve all of these.</li>\n<li><b>Low Impact, Less Strain on Joints, Soft Tissue, Skeleton</b>: The elastic element of a rebounder, either springs or bungee bands, absorbs much of the impact or shock on each bounce, thereby making rebound exercise more attractive to those who need to avoid shocking or straining their joints, soft tissue, and skeleton.</li></ul>\n<p>Rebounding is said to assist dozens of specific medical conditions\u2014from arthritis to vision improvement\u2014but there is little systematic peer-reviewed scientific evidence for these claims.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"NASA_study_and_scientific_support_generally\">NASA study and scientific support generally</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Rebound_exercise&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: NASA study and scientific support generally\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The single most important and most frequently quoted scientific research study on rebounding was conducted in 1980 through NASA by A.
