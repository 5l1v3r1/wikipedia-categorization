BodyCode Training System is a technique for evaluating and correcting movement patterns using specifically designed equipment. It deals with how people construct awkward postures, and how to maintain and apply intervention strategies to correct them. It was developed in the 1990s by Pino Carbone.  It is mainly used by dancers and athletes but can be used by anybody. It is among the curricula of Boston Ballet School, the Chinese National Ballet, English National Ballet School, and other private ballet school.  BodyCode Training System includes aerobic and anaerobic activities, isometric and isotonic exercises and proprioceptive movement, as well as static and dynamic activities.  The specific set of exercises suitable for an individual is designed by a trainer after a postural examination.  In 2004, Carbone was awarded Geneva’s international inventor’s prize for designing BodyCode equipment called SpheralMind.  BodyCode Training System was developed by Pino Carbone. Carbone was a professional dancer for several years before he had an accident in the 1980s during the rehearsal of a ballet that affected his back and resulted in a herniated disc. Following his injury, he had to incorporate acupuncture, Pilates, Gyrotonics yoga, massage and physical therapy in his regimen in order to continue with his dancing. At that time, he started research to develop a training system for strengthening and stretching muscles without the risk of injury that he could use.  After several years of research and work, he developed the BodyCode System in the 1990s.  According to Carbone, he was tired of dancing in pain. He wanted to settle down and open his own studio. By then he was already doing Gyrotonics with Juliu Horvath, in New York City, so he decided to open his first studio in Florence and offer training that combined principles of yoga, dance, Gyrotonics and Pilates.  Although Carbone primarily worked with dancers and athletes, in the early 1990s, he began collaborating with orthopaedics, neurosurgeons and other medical specialists.   Currently, it is taught in dance programs worldwide.  BodyCode exercises are based on the principles of harmonizing body and mind. The basis of the method is to restore the physical as well as mental balance. Theories of BodyCode have oriental roots and are related to acupuncture, yoga, dance and feng shui.  It draws influences from Gyrotonics as well as Pilates.  BodyCode also employs basic principles of traditional gymnastics and dance movements. The purpose of the method is to improve the body movement and postural alignment.   BodyCode Training System includes aerobic and anaerobic activities, isometric and isotonic exercises and proprioception exercises as well as static and dynamic activities.  It deals with how people construct awkward postures, and how to maintain and apply intervention strategies to correct them.  There are various pieces of equipment designed by Carbone for performing different body movements. Some of these are handmade  and include Pegasus, SpheralMind, ProArch, Geometrix, Elvis, Dance Ruler and MasterStretch.  MasterStretch is developed for improving the flexibility of the spine and coordination and proprioception.  Carbone holds the trademark for BodyCode system as well as several equipment design patents. Only legally authorized instructors can lawfully provide BodyCode training. Before beginning BodyCode training, an individual's posture and balance are evaluated in order to determine their weaknesses and their requirements. Following this assessment, the instructor prepares a program that is focused on rebalancing the body.  The first phase of evaluating body posture is called decoding and the second phase of training to improve balance is called coding.  BodyCode uses the concept of work-in as opposed to work-out. According to this concept, the physical imbalance, stress, trauma, bad habits and poor posture should not be corrected externally but internally. The individuals while practising this technique are taught  to be aware of their body characteristics and how to train it.  The BodyCode System was featured in Marie Claire Spanish in the article Top ten en gimnasios - El más barato (Top ten cheapest gym equipment).  Official website
