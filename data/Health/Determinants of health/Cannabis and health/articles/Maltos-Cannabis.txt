Maltos-Cannabis was a Swedish hemp seed-based malt beverage "food remedy" with sedative qualities produced beginning around the late 19th century into the early 20th century.   The product was widely available in Sweden, Denmark, and Norway,  and was advertised and reviewed in American publications. An 1899 pharmaceutical reference book printed in Philadelphia defined the product: "A Swedish nutrient in form of a yellowish-white powder, possessing a taste at first saline, later sweetish, and then acrid and bitter."
