Stress is wear and tear on the body in response to stressful agents. <a href=\"/wiki/Hans_Selye\" title=\"Hans Selye\">Hans Selye</a> called such agents stressors and said they could be physical, physiological, psychological or sociocultural.\nAnd stress is not an anxiety disorder and it is not a normative concept.\n</p><p>A person typically is stressed when positive or negative (e.g., threatening) experiences temporarily strain or overwhelm adaptive capacities. Stress is highly individualized and depends on variables such as the novelty, rate, intensity, duration, or personal interpretation of the input, and genetic or experiential factors. Both acute and chronic stress can intensify morbidity from anxiety disorders. One person's fun may be another person's stressor. For an example, panic attacks are more frequent when the predisposed person is exposed to stressors.\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Stress_reduction_strategies\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Stress reduction strategies</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#The_five_R&#39;s_of_stress_and_anxiety_reduction\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">The five R's of stress and anxiety reduction</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Defenses\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Defenses</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Summary\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Summary</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Stress_as_in_clinical_medicine\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Stress as in clinical medicine</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#Acute_stress_disorder\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Acute stress disorder</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-3 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#Symptoms\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.1.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Symptoms</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-3 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#Autonomic_signs_of_&quot;panic_anxiety&quot;\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.1.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Autonomic signs of \"panic anxiety\"</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-9\"><a href=\"#Post-traumatic_stress_disorder_(PTSD)\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-3 tocsection-10\"><a href=\"#Causes\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.2.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Causes</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-3 tocsection-11\"><a href=\"#Typical_symptoms\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.2.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Typical symptoms</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-3 tocsection-12\"><a href=\"#Treatment\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.2.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Treatment</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-3 tocsection-13\"><a href=\"#Prognosis\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.2.4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Prognosis</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-14\"><a href=\"#In_surgery\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">In surgery</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-15\"><a href=\"#Stress_ulceration\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Stress ulceration</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-16\"><a href=\"#See_also\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">See also</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-17\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-18\"><a href=\"#Further_reading\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">7</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Further reading</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Stress_reduction_strategies\">Stress reduction strategies</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Stress-related_disorders&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Stress reduction strategies\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Stress-reduction strategies can be helpful to many stressed/anxious person.

Presumably the process is unconscious and the aim is to fool oneself. It is intra psychic processes serving to provide relief from emotional conflict and anxiety. Conscious efforts are frequently  made for the same reasons, but true defense mechanisms are unconscious.\n</p><p>Some of the common defense mechanisms are:\nCompensation, Con-version, denial, displacement, dissociation, idealization, identification, incorporation, introjection, projection, rationalization, reaction formation, regression, sublimation, substitution, symbolization and undoing.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Summary\">Summary</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Stress-related_disorders&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Summary\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The major function of these psychological defenses is to prevent the experiencing of painful emotions.  There are several major problems with their use.\n</p><p><b>First</b>\nMany of these defenses create new problems that are as bad, or worse, than the emotional problems they mask. Some are just plain destructive. <br />\nExample: <br />\nRejection literally destroys the relationships we care most about.\n</p><p><b>Second</b>\nThese defenses distort our ability to perceive reality as it is. And this prevents us from dealing with our problems in a constructive way.\n</p><p><b>Third</b>\nThese defenses do not rid us of the painful feelings we have. In fact, by masking them so that we do not feel them, we effectively store them up within ourselves.  Emotions are discharged through expression, so by denying ourselves the chance to feel them, we also deny ourselves the ability to get rid of them.\n</p><p><b>Fourth</b>\nThese defenses do not just screen out painful emotions. They are, in fact, defenses against all emotion. So the more effective our defenses become in protecting us from our\npainful feelings, the less able we are to experience the joyful and happy feelings that make life worth living.\n</p><p><b>Finally</b>\nThese defenses are not perfect. As more and more hurt is stored away, a tension is developed. We become increasingly anxious, nervous, and irritable. We become emotionally unpredictable. And when our defenses weaken, as they will from time to time, we experience emotional explosions.\n</p><p><b>Ultimately</b>\nThese defenses prevent us from knowing what is wrong, but they do not prevent us from feeling bad.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Stress_as_in_clinical_medicine\">Stress as in clinical medicine</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Stress-related_disorders&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Stress as in clinical medicine\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Acute_stress_disorder\">Acute stress disorder</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Stress-related_disorders&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Acute stress disorder\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/Acute_stress_disorder\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Acute stress disorder\">Acute stress disorder</a> occurs in individuals without any other apparent psychiatric disorder, in response to exceptional physical/or psychological stress.

The stress may be an overwhelming traumatic experience (e.g. accident, battle, physical assault, rape) or unusually sudden change in social circumstances of the individual, such as multiple bereavement.\nIndividual vulnerability and coping capacity play a role in the occurrence and severity of acute stress reactions, as evidenced by the fact that not all people exposed to exceptional stress develop symptoms.
