The USDA National Nutrient Database is a database produced by the United States Department of Agriculture that provides the nutritional content of many generic and proprietary-branded foods. Released in August 2015 and revised in May 2016, the current release, Standard Reference 28 (SR28), contains "data on 8,800 food items and up to 150 food components".  New releases occur about once per year. The database may be searched online,  queried through a representational state transfer API,  or downloaded.
