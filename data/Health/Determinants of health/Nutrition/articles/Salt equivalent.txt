Salt equivalent is usually quoted on food nutrition information tables on food labels, and is a different way of defining sodium intake, noting that salt is chemically sodium chloride. To convert from sodium to the approximate salt equivalent, multiply sodium content by 2.5:                                                                m                                                   N                   a                   C                   l                                                                         m                                                   N                   a                                                                          =                                                                 m                                                         N                     a                                                                  +                                m                                                         C                     l                                                                                            m                                                   N                   a                                                                          ≈                                                23                                u                              +               35.5                                u                                                        23                                u                                                         =                                 58.5             23                             ≈         2.5                 {\displaystyle {\frac {m_{\mathrm {NaCl} }}{m_{\mathrm {Na} }}}={\frac {m_{\mathrm {Na} }+m_{\mathrm {Cl} }}{m_{\mathrm {Na} }}}\approx {\frac {23\mathrm {u} +35.5\mathrm {u} }{23\mathrm {u} }}={\frac {58.5}{23}}\approx 2.5}     (see: atomic mass and molecular mass).
