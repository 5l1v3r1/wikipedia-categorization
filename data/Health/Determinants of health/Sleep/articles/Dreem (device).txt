Dreem is a sleep device that monitors, analyzes, and claims to enhance quality of sleep. It's a miniaturized and autonomous headband that monitors the quality of sleep and then uses sound to help fall asleep faster, get deeper sleep, and wake up at the optimal time through smart alarm.     Dreem is a headband that collects, reports data and also claims to enhance the user's behavior in real-time according to the data collected. The sensors include EEG electrodes, accelerometer and pulse oximeter.   Rythm, manufacturer of Dreem, was launched in 2014. $11 million were raised from private investors and public grants the same year to pursue the manufacturing of sleep-improving neurotechnology device.  As of June 2017, a total of $22 million were raised by Rythm.  The version 2 of the Dreem headband was released in June 2017 on pre order after practicing tests with a first beta version on 500 users at the end of 2016.  The company claims that more than 50 engineers worked on the second version, collaborating with famous neuroscientists such as Emmanuel Mignot, Christoph Koch, David Eagleman. The device was designed by Yves BÃ©har.  The dry polymer EEG electrodes monitor the brain activity, and the bone-conducting audio devices transmit sound directly to the inner ear. The company claims that the device will improve the deep sleep by up to 32 percent.  The headband comes with sensors in contact with the forehead and around the ears that keep track of a wearer's sleep stage by measuring brain activity. When the sensors detect a sleeper has entered into deep sleep, the headband turns on a frequency of sound called "pink noise" at a precise time that enhances the quality of deep sleep. The pink noise also helps the deep sleeper better transition to the dreamy REM (rapid eye movement) state that comes afterwards.
