The parafacial zone (PZ) is a brain structure located within the medulla oblongata which contains GABAergic neurons and is involved in slow-wave sleep.     It is one of several GABAergic sleep-promoting nuclei in the brain, which include the ventrolateral preoptic area of the hypothalamus, the nucleus accumbens core (specifically, the D2-type medium spiny neurons in the core which co-express adenosine A2A receptors), and a GABAergic nucleus in the lateral hypothalamus which co-release melanin-concentrating hormone.      The parafacial zone promotes slow-wave sleep by inhibiting the glutamatergic parabrachial nucleus, a component of the ascending reticular activating system that mediates wakefulness and arousal, via the release of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA onto those neurons.   Optogenetic activation of GABAergic PZ neurons induces cortical slow-wave activity and slow-wave sleep in awake animals.
