World Sleep Day (the Friday before the northern hemisphere vernal equinox) is an annual event organized by the World Sleep Day Committee of the World Sleep Society, formerly World Association of Sleep Medicine (WASM), since 2008.  The goal is to celebrate the benefits of good and healthy sleep and to draw society's attention to the burden of sleep problems and their medical, educational, and social aspects, and to promote the prevention and management of sleep disorders. Through World Sleep Day the World Sleep Society raises awareness of sleep disorders and their better understanding and prevention, and aims to reduce the burden of sleep problems on society, which threaten the health or quality of life of as much as 45% of the world's population. On 17 March 2017 World Sleep Day trended on Twitter. Renowned Indian actor Amitabh Bachchan tweeted using his handle @SrBachchan, which is followed by 25.5 million, that - 'its World Sleep Day tomorrow 17 March..whatever that meansÂ !!'.  Thousands of people from around the world tweeted on world sleep day. It also shared some space on other social media. It is estimated that sleep deprivation costs the US over $400 billion a year with Japan losing $138 billion, Germany $60 billion, the UK $50 billion, and Canada $21 billion.  World Sleep Day is observed annually on the Friday before the March Equinox.  The first World Sleep Day was held on 14 March 2008. Events involving discussions, presentations of educational materials and exhibitions take place around the world and online.
