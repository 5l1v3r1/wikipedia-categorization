Start School Later, aka Healthy Hours, is a non-profit organization in the United States.    It was founded in 2011 by grassroots advocates, sleep researchers, pediatricians, social workers, and educators to help communities delay school starting times and ensure safe, healthy school hours.     The organization, which has over 90 chapters throughout the United States, has been featured in The Huffington Post  and Psychiatric News  and has received media coverage and editorial support in publications including The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, NPR, BBC Brasil, WGBH, and The Washington Post.   In 2013 U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan tweeted his support for later high school start times,  and since 2014 the American Academy of Pediatrics, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the American Medical Association have issued a policy statement recommending that middle and high schools start no earlier than 8:30 a.m.  In April 2017, Start School Later - together with the RAND Corporation, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and Yale School of Medicine's Department of Pediatrics and Section on Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine - co-sponsored the first-ever national conference on Adolescent Sleep, Health, and School Start Times.
