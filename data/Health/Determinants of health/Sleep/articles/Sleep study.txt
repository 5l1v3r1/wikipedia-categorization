Sleep studies are tests that record the body activity during sleep. They are helpful in identification of sleep disorders.  Polysomnography, a type of sleep study, is the gold standard to rule out obstructive sleep apnea.  If a home study does not find obstructive sleep apnea, but the patient still complains of unrefreshing sleep and daytime sleepiness, an in-lab polysomnogram may be necessary to find other possible disorders.  Sleep studies can help diagnose or rule out: The most common sleep studies are: A simple sleep study is done in the home.  Polysomnography records several body functions during sleep, including brain activity, eye movement, oxygen and carbon dioxide blood levels, heart rate and rhythm, breathing rate and rhythm, the flow of air through the mouth and nose, snoring, body muscle movements, and chest and belly movement.  The MSLT measures, by several nap opportunities in one day, how long it takes a person to fall asleep. It also determines whether REM sleep appears upon falling asleep.    It is usually performed immediately after an overnight study. This test measures whether a person can stay awake during a time when she or he is normally awake.   Like the MSLT, the MWT is performed in a sleep diagnostic center over 4 - 5 nap periods. A mean sleep onset latency of less than 10 minutes is suggestive of excessive daytime sleepiness. The Home Sleep Test also called an Out of Sleep Center Test (OCST) is used exclusively for the diagnosis of sleep apnea. Portable equipment is sent home with the patient. The channels are usually limited to airflow, respiratory effort, and oximetry.
