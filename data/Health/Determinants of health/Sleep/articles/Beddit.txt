Beddit is a Finnish based technology company that makes sleep-tracking devices and a sleep-tracking app to help monitor sleep.  The company was founded in 2007 and was acquired by Apple on May 9, 2017.  As of 2016, Beddit has collected over 3 million nights of sleep data from its users.  Beddit was founded in 2007 by Lasse Lepp√§korpi.  The company released their first sleep-tracker after a successful crowd-funding campaign on Indiegogo where crowd-funders raised over $500,000 in 2013 and Beddit released their first sleep tracker later that year in November for early Indiegogo backers.     Misfit's Shine fitness tracker announced support for Beddit's sleep-trackers as part of a partnership between the two companies in July 2014.  Beddit's sleep-tracking app was released for the Apple Watch in October 2015.  Beddit released their latest sleep-tracker on October 4, 2016 at select Apple Stores, on Amazon and on Beddit's website.  On May 9, 2017, Apple Inc. acquired Beddit for an undisclosed amount.  Beddit stopped selling their sleep-trackers for online retailers and in physical retail stores starting in 2017 and only sells their products in Apple Stores and on Apple's website.
