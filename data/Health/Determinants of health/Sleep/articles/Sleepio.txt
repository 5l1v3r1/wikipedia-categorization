Sleepio is a digital sleep-improvement program featuring cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques developed by sleep scientist Professor Colin Espie and ex-insomniac Peter Hames.  In a commentary on research published by The Lancet, Sleepio was described as “a proven intervention for sleep disorders using the internet”.  The journal Nature described Sleepio as “about as effective as CBT delivered in person”.  In March 2013 Sleepio was one of the launch apps in the NHS-approved Healthy Apps Library.  Sleepio was one of ten partners worldwide to launch on Jawbone’s UP self-tracking platform in April 2013,  allowing import of sleep data collected by the UP activity tracker into Sleepio. Integrated support is also available to users of the BodyMedia FIT band.  The Sleepio program is delivered via the web and via Apple devices.  A virtual sleep expert, The Prof, guides the user through six interactive weekly sessions.   The results of the CBT group show that Sleepio is comparable in effectiveness to face-to-face delivered cognitive behavioral therapy.  In November 2013, Sleepio was the winning "Healthcare IT Product Innovation" as selected by a UK healthcare industry website, E-Health Insider.  The start-up was also a semi-finalist in the BIG Awards organised by Cisco Systems, Inc. in 2013.  In April 2014, Sleepio won the Bupa Startup competition at Wired Health.  In June 2014, the company behind the Sleepio program, Big Health, was chosen as the Best Health Startup at The Europas Awards, the annual event honoring the best tech startups in Europe.
