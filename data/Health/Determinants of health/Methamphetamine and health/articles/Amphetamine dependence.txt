Amphetamine dependence refers to a state of psychological dependence on a drug in the amphetamine class. In individuals with substance use disorder (problematic use or abuse with dependence), psychotherapy is currently the best treatment option as no pharmacological treatment has been approved.  Tolerance is expected to develop with regular substituted amphetamine use.  When substituted amphetamines are abused, drug tolerance develops rapidly.  Psychostimulants – including amphetamine and methamphetamine – do not cause physical dependence.  The acute effect of amphetamine use manifests itself in euphoria, intensification of the train of thought, speech and motoricity and an increase in initiative and urge to move. In case of chronic abuse, vegetative disorders soon occur such as bouts of sweating, trouble sleeping, tremor, ataxia and diarrhea; the degradation of the personality takes place relatively slowly.  Severe withdrawal associated with dependence from recreational substituted amphetamine use can be difficult for a user to cope with.    Long-term use of certain substituted amphetamines, particularly methamphetamine, can reduce dopamine activity in the brain.   Psychostimulants that increase dopamine and mimic the effects of substituted amphetamines, but with lower abuse liability, could theoretically be used as replacement therapy in amphetamine dependence.  However, the few studies that used amphetamine, bupropion, methylphenidate and modafinil as a replacement therapy did not result in less methamphetamine use or craving.  In 2013, overdose on amphetamine, methamphetamine, and other compounds implicated in an "amphetamine use disorder" resulted in an estimated 3,788 deaths worldwide (3,425–4,145 deaths, 95% confidence).
