The general appearance is of accelerated aging of the face, with a characteristic pattern of facial wrinkling and sallow coloration. A summary of a study published by the National Institutes of Health found that certain facial features appeared in about 8% of smokers who had smoked a full decade while those same features were absent in a control group of non-smokers.
