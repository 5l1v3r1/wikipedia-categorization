 The smoking age is the minimum legal age required to purchase or smoke tobacco products. Most countries have laws that restrict those below a minimum age from legally purchasing tobacco products. The federal law requires states to have a minimum age of 18 years for sale/purchase of tobacco products (21 U.S.C. § 387f. (3)(a)(ii)). State and local laws may extend this ban and also prohibit supply, possession and consumption to/by person underage, or increase the age beyond 18. However, most states do not directly ban the consumption of tobacco by a minor. The federal law requiring states to have a minimum purchasing age at 18 is enforced by withholding FEMA disaster and non-disaster grants from states that have purchasing ages under 18, and currently no state falls under that category.  The minimum age of 15 years was introduced on 11 November 1890.  The minimum age was raised from 15 to 18 on 1 January 1988.  The minimum age was raised from 18 to 21 on 1 January 2016.  18 (purchase de jure) 16 (public possession & purchase de facto) No minimum age prior to 1908.
