A tabagie is a room designated for smoking tobacco and socializing. In every Palace was a Tabagie, a high large room with a dozen contented saturnine figures round a large long table, a long Dutch pipe in the mouth of each.  In modern Quebec French, tabagie refers to a tobacco shop, which in Parisian French is called a bureau de tabac.
