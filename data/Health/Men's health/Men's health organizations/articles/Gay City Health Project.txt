Gay City Health Project, also known as Gay City, is a multicultural nonprofit organization based in Seattle, Washington which promotes the welfare of gay men and other men who have sex with men (MSMs), and more generally the LGBT community in Seattle. Gay City provides HIV testing to MSMs, operates an LGBT resource referral phone line, manages a smoking cessation project called "Tobactivism", and houses the LGBT library formerly held by the Seattle LGBT Community Center until it closed in 2009.  In 2007 Gay City became a research partner for the Seattle branch of the HIV Vaccine Trials Network.  Coordinates: 47°36′50″N 122°19′29″W﻿ / ﻿47.613998°N 122.324709°W﻿ / 47.613998; -122.324709
