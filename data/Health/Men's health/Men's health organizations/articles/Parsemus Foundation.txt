The Parsemus Foundation is an American non-governmental organization whose stated objective is to advance low cost evidence-based medicines not pursued by the pharmaceutical industry.  The foundationâ€™s focus is on supporting small proof-of-concept studies and then pursuing press coverage of the results, so that the advances change treatment practice rather than disappearing into the scientific literature. Many of the studies supported involve low-cost approaches that are not under patent.  Founded in 2005, Parsemus is an advocate of research into the plausibility of RISUG, a reversible male contraceptive.   The foundation began procuring RISUG's United States intellectual property rights in November 2010, completed the acquisition process in February 2012, and is now conducting toxicology tests as an initial step towards Food and Drug Administration approval.    Animal trials have thus far proved effective with no negative side effects; human trials are being planned for 2015-2016 with a possible market release by 2017.  The foundation was also noted for its support of the Archives of Internal Medicine's less-is-more series.
