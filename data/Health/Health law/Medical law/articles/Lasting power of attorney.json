The word <a href=\"/wiki/Lawyer\" title=\"Lawyer\">attorney</a> in this context is someone (or in some circumstances an organisation such as a company) legally appointed or empowered to act for another person. The person giving the power is known as the <b>donor</b>. The word 'lasting' in the context of an LPA means that the power may continue even if the person (though still alive) no longer has <a href=\"/wiki/Capacity_(law)\" title=\"Capacity (law)\">capacity</a> to exercise the power. The Lasting Power of Attorney can be applied for online.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> The gov.uk tool offers guidance throughout the process, and prevents the user from making mistakes that may invalidate their LPA application.\n</p><p>The former <a href=\"/wiki/Enduring_power_of_attorney\" title=\"Enduring power of attorney\">EPA</a> was simple to administer, but failed to provide for some decisions which may have to be made in circumstances that preclude their being made by the person principally affected. In particular, the attorney's powers under the EPA were largely defined in terms of money and property, and were not related to decisions on medical matters such as the continuation or otherwise of life-sustaining treatment, or welfare matters such as a move to a different kind of accommodation. The primary purpose of the changes under <a href=\"/wiki/Mental_Capacity_Act_2005\" title=\"Mental Capacity Act 2005\">Mental Capacity Act 2005</a> (MCA 2005) was to rectify this omission, by creating two LPAs: one for property and financial affairs (the LPA(PFA)) and one for Health and Welfare (the LPA(H&amp;W)).\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Business_Lasting_Power_of_Attorney\">Business Lasting Power of Attorney</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Lasting_power_of_attorney&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Business Lasting Power of Attorney\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>While the LPA is primarily designed to deal with personal affairs and finances, business owners or directors are faced with more complex considerations. While a close friend or family member may be suitable for managing personal affairs in times of incapacity, businesses may require subject matter experts and depending on the business structure, there are certain governance requirements. Therefore, the Business Lasting Power of Attorney (BLPA) is a separate arrangement that is similar in function to the LPA. Business owners arranging a LPA and BLPA can therefore split between personal and business affairs.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Administrative_and_legal_background\">Administrative and legal background</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Lasting_power_of_attorney&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Administrative and legal background\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The LPA system is administered by the <a href=\"/wiki/Office_of_the_Public_Guardian_(England_and_Wales)\" title=\"Office of the Public Guardian (England and Wales)\">Office of the Public Guardian</a> (OPG), an agency of the <a href=\"/wiki/Ministry_of_Justice_(United_Kingdom)\" title=\"Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)\">Ministry of Justice</a> of the <a href=\"/wiki/United_Kingdom\" title=\"United Kingdom\">United Kingdom</a>. Its contact details are explained in section 2.2 below headed 'The role of the OPG in relation to Lasting Powers of Attorney'. The <a href=\"/wiki/Office_of_the_Public_Guardian_(England_and_Wales)\" title=\"Office of the Public Guardian (England and Wales)\">OPG</a> was set up in 2007 under the <a href=\"/wiki/Mental_Capacity_Act_2005\" title=\"Mental Capacity Act 2005\">MCA 2005</a>, replacing the similarly-named Public Guardianship Office which had a more limited range of responsibilities. It is headed by the Public Guardian, whose main role is the protection of people who lack mental <a href=\"/wiki/Capacity_(law)\" title=\"Capacity (law)\">capacity</a>.\n</p><p>The MCA 2005 provides a statutory framework to empower and protect vulnerable people who are not able to make their own decisions. It makes clear who can take decisions on their behalf, in which situations, and how they should do so. Through the LPA, the Act enables people to plan ahead for a time when they may lose capacity. Detailed guidance is provided by a Code of Practice to the MCA 2005<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> to the Act, which people working as professionals in this field are required to 'have regard to': that is, to observe, unless (having decided in specific circumstances not to do so) they are prepared to explain afterwards \u2013 most probably in a post-incident inquiry \u2013 why not.\n</p><p>Where there are suspicions that an attorney might not be acting in the best interests of the donor, the <a href=\"/wiki/Office_of_the_Public_Guardian_(England_and_Wales)\" title=\"Office of the Public Guardian (England and Wales)\">OPG</a> will arrange an investigation. If the OPG decides that formal action is required, and more generally if any disputes arise on subjects covered by the MCA, the matter is referred to the <a href=\"/wiki/Court_of_Protection\" title=\"Court of Protection\">Court of Protection</a> (CoP), which is part of the Family Division of the <a href=\"/wiki/High_Court_of_Justice\" title=\"High Court of Justice\">High Court</a> and was set up under the MCA for this purpose. The role of the CoP in decision-making is complementary to that of the OPG in relation to matters of regulation and supervision.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"The_.27five_principles.27\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_'five_principles'\">The 'five principles'</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Lasting_power_of_attorney&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: The &#039;five principles&#039;\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The guiding principles of the MCA 2005<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> are set out in <a href=\"/wiki/Mental_Capacity_Act_2005#The_five_statutory_principles\" title=\"Mental Capacity Act 2005\">five principles</a> which indicate how the term <a href=\"/wiki/Capacity_(law)\" title=\"Capacity (law)\">'capacity'</a> (implying in this context mental capacity) is to be interpreted:\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol><li>A person must be assumed to have capacity unless it is established that he lacks capacity.</li>\n<li>A person is not to be treated as unable to make a decision unless all practicable steps to help him to do so have been taken without success.</li>\n<li>A person is not to be treated as unable to make a decision merely because he makes an unwise decision.</li>\n<li>An act done, or decision made, under this Act for or on behalf of a person who lacks capacity must be done, or made, in his best interests.</li>\n<li>Before the act is done, or the decision is made, regard must be had to whether the purpose for which it is needed can be as effectively achieved in a way that is less restrictive of the person\u2019s rights and freedom of action.</li></ol></blockquote>\n<p>The test so defined is 'decision-specific'. It can indicate an answer to the question 'Can he any longer use a gas ring safely when unsupervised?', but does not allow for wider questions to be given a firm yes/no answer when the real answer is that he has restricted capacity and so can deal with some aspects but not others. As stated in an official summary of the Act,<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> it is 'a single clear test for assessing whether a person lacks capacity to take a particular decision at a particular time'.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_role_of_the_OPG_in_relation_to_lasting_powers_of_attorney\">The role of the OPG in relation to lasting powers of attorney</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Lasting_power_of_attorney&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: The role of the OPG in relation to lasting powers of attorney\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>From the point of view of someone who needs (or may potentially need) one or both LPAs, the <a href=\"/wiki/Office_of_the_Public_Guardian_(England_and_Wales)\" title=\"Office of the Public Guardian (England and Wales)\">Office of the Public Guardian</a> is one of the first points of contact.\n</p><p>To apply for a Lasting Power of Attorney, the donor has to fill in the application forms giving details for themselves, the attorneys and another person known as the certificate provider to witness that the decision has been made with the donor\u2019s understanding and agreement.

Many institutions, whilst in theory accepting the power, make it extremely difficult to put in practice. Many claim that this is to protect the donor or to comply with money laundering regulations, but whatever the reasons, it can make the whole process very challenging and stressful, especially if the donor themselves is by this time unable to support the process, for example, from failing mental capacity.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources.
