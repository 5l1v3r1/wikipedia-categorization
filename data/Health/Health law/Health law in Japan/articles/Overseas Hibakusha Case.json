Considering these, when preparing and issuing Directive No. 402, the appellant [the State] should have fully investigated and examined whether or not there was any legal ground for such construction or treatment...if the appellant did so, we can find that it would be sufficiently possible for the appellant to have recognized illegality of...Directive No. 402. Yet, the appellant did not try to clearly explain the very circumstances where Directive No. 402 was prepared and issued, and even by examining the whole evidence of this case, we still cannot find that the appellant fully investigated or considered this issue....We should find the appellant, by doing so, to have breached its basic official duty of construing statutes faithfully, or at least neglected such duty.  Consequently, in accordance with Article 1, para.1 of the Act on State Liability for Compensation, the appellant is liable to compensate for damage that it caused to the plaintiff by preparing and issuing Directive No. 402, which is illegal, and continuing to take the administrative treatment resulting in forfeiture of right based on the directive.\n</p><p>(2) The plaintiffs, while being subject to unfair discrimination against atomic bomb survivors, harbored various feelings such as worries about their health and living, which were growing due to unavailability of proper medical treatment, and anger and resentment for being forced into such circumstances and left without receiving any relief because they were residing in South Korea. At that time, triggered by the judgment of A's Suit,<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> a sign of hope appeared for the plaintiffs to receive relief under the Two Acts for Atomic Bomb Survivors, but just then, Directive No. 402 was prepared and issued, and the administrative practice based on this directive was continued after that. This made the plaintiffs feel further stronger disappointment and anger, a sense of being discriminated, and dissatisfaction, and also feeling irritated by their aging, the plaintiffs at last had no choice but to file this suit.\n</p><p>(3) This case is an extraordinary one in which with regard to relief for atomic bomb survivors who suffered unprecedented serious damage caused by the atomic bombing, the appellant prepared and issued the directive based on an erroneous construction of the relevant statutes. In light of the seriousness, magnitude, and particular nature of the mental distress that the plaintiffs suffered before filing this suit, it is appropriate to grant each of them one million yen as compensation for their mental distress.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Dissent\">Dissent</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Overseas_Hibakusha_Case&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Dissent\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Justice Kainaka agreed with the Majority that:<sup id=\"cite_ref-Overseas_Hibakusha_Case_1-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Overseas_Hibakusha_Case-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<ul><li>\"Directive No. 402...should inevitably be deemed to be based on an illegal construction of the Three Acts for Atomic Bomb Survivors.\"</li></ul>\n<p>However, he opined that:\n</p>\n<ul><li>the Director-General of the Public Health Bureau of the Ministry of Health and Welfare's interpretation of the law, as embodied in Directive No. 402, did not lack reasonable grounds.</li></ul>\n<p>\"government committee members, etc. consistently stated that [the first two Acts for Atomic Bomb Survivors] shall not apply to 'atomic bomb survivors' residing overseas, and this was also the intention of the legislator.\"\n</p>\n<ul><li>the Director-General's enforcement of Directive No. 402 did not constitute negligence under the Act on State Liability for Compensation.</li></ul>\n<p>\"Basically, in order to say that a construction of a statute based on certain legal grounds has lost such ground at a certain point of time, there must be a new development that would affect the construction, such as revision to the statute or the court's rulings showing a clearly opposite construction....no such development seems to have occurred, and therefore the said construction cannot be deemed to have lost its legal grounds.\"\n</p><p>\"...where there is a conflict of views over how to construe a statute...and both views have reasonable grounds, if a public officer performs public duties while relying on either view that he/she considers justifiable, it is inappropriate to immediately find the public officer to have been negligent in doing so only because his/her performance of duties is later judged to be illegal.\"\n</p>\n<ul><li>The plaintiffs were not entitled to damages for emotional distress.</li></ul>\n<p>\"In general, an act cannot be deemed to be illegal under tort law unless it infringes any legally protected interest, and even if an act committed by the State or its official in charge has hurt a person's feelings...such person cannot immediately claim damages by alleging that his/her interest has been infringed thereby.\"\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Impact\">Impact</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Overseas_Hibakusha_Case&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Impact\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<table class=\"plainlinks metadata ambox mbox-small-left ambox-content\" role=\"presentation\"><tbody><tr><td class=\"mbox-image\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"[icon]\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png\" width=\"20\" height=\"14\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/30px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/40px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png 2x\" data-file-width=\"44\" data-file-height=\"31\" /></a></td><td class=\"mbox-text\"><div class=\"mbox-text-span\"><b>This section is empty.</b> <small>You can help by <a class=\"external text\" href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Overseas_Hibakusha_Case&amp;action=edit&amp;section=\">adding to it</a>.</small>  <small><i>(July 2010)</i></small></div></td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Other_hibakusha_cases\">Other hibakusha cases</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Overseas_Hibakusha_Case&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Other hibakusha cases\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The Court had previously issued rulings on hibakusha cases.
