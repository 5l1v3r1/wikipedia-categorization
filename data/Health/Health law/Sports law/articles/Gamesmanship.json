The skilled gamesman can counter this tactic by waiting until the game has been in play for some time, before revealing that he or she suffers from a far more serious condition, such as a <a href=\"/wiki/Heart_disease\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Heart disease\">heart defect</a></li>\n<li>In <a href=\"/wiki/Billiards\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Billiards\">billiards</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Snooker\" title=\"Snooker\">snooker</a>, intentionally standing in the opponent's line of sight, and then suddenly moving when the opponent is about to shoot under the guise of getting out of their sight line. \"More or less at the last moment, leaping into the correct position with exaggerated agility, and stand rigidly with head bowed.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup></li>\n<li>Distracting the opposing player by complaining about other people who might be (but were not) distracting the opposing player. Potter, who always insisted that the good gamesman must give the appearance of being a good <a href=\"/wiki/Sportsmanship\" title=\"Sportsmanship\">sportsman</a>, recommended this approach. For example, if an opponent is about to take a shot at billiards, it is bad gamesmanship to fidget and whistle but good gamesmanship to distract him by loudly requesting silence from spectators: 'Simulate annoyance, <i>on the opponent's behalf</i>, with the onlookers'.<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup></li>\n<li>When winning a point maintain direct eye contact with opponent, but when losing one always avoid direct eye contact.</li>\n<li>In <a href=\"/wiki/Cricket\" title=\"Cricket\">cricket</a>, coming out to bat with two right-handed gloves and then wasting time sorting out the problem.</li>\n<li>In <a href=\"/wiki/Baseball\" title=\"Baseball\">baseball</a>, a batter disrupting a <a href=\"/wiki/Pitcher\" title=\"Pitcher\">pitcher</a>'s flow by calling a time-out just before he delivers the pitch.</li>\n<li>When losing an outdoor game, feigning a deep, informed and more than amateur interest in e.g. <a href=\"/wiki/Botany\" title=\"Botany\">botany</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Ornithology\" title=\"Ornithology\">ornithology</a>, in order to convey a breadth of interests and suggest to the opponent that losing is not of concern.  This can cause the opponent to relax their attention, or at any rate rob them of the satisfaction of winning. Potter termed this 'the <i>natural hampette</i>...See <i>Gardens for Gamesmen</i>, or <i>When to be Fond of Flowers</i>(15s.)'.<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup></li>\n<li>In amateur <a href=\"/wiki/Ice_hockey\" title=\"Ice hockey\">ice hockey</a>, intentionally <a href=\"/wiki/Icing_(ice_hockey)\" title=\"Icing (ice hockey)\">icing the puck</a>, lining up at the wrong face-off dot, or shooting the puck over the glass (in professional hockey, the team that ices the puck is not allowed a line change, while shooting the puck over the glass leads to a two-minute penalty).</li>\n<li>In <a href=\"/wiki/Tennis\" title=\"Tennis\">tennis</a> (when serving) taking a long time between serves and making the receiver wait.</li>\n<li>In rugby league:\n<ul><li>Taking too long to pack down in a scrum, thus wasting time;</li>\n<li>Taking too long to take to the field before a match or after half-time, thus forcing the opposition team to wait for a prolonged period before the match starts or resumes.</li></ul></li>\n<li>In <a href=\"/wiki/American_football\" title=\"American football\">American football</a>, calling a time out the instant before a game-winning or game-tying <a href=\"/wiki/Field_goal_(American_and_Canadian_football)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Field goal (American and Canadian football)\">field goal</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Point_after_touchdown\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Point after touchdown\">PAT</a> to break the normal flow of play.

In such \"Advicemanship\", 'the advice <i>must be vague</i>, to make certain it is not helpful', although Potter also noted that 'according to some authorities the advice should be quite genuine and perfectly practical'.<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup></li>\n<li>Asking one's opponent's advice for a (fictitious) match the following day, against an implied stronger opponent.</li>\n<li>Claiming that the game being played \"just isn't my sport\", or claiming less expertise than the player actually possesses (a mild form of <a href=\"/wiki/Hustling\" title=\"Hustling\">hustling</a>).</li>\n<li>In <a href=\"/wiki/American_football\" title=\"American football\">American football</a>, the very common practice of taking one or more timeouts to give an opposing kicker an excessive amount of time to think about a critical kick; most often a field goal or extra point but sometimes a potential on-side kick.  The intent is to cause the kicker to get overly stressed about making a mistake and hopefully create a self-fulfilling prophecy.  This is commonly referred to as \"<a href=\"/wiki/Icing_the_kicker\" title=\"Icing the kicker\">icing the kicker</a>.\" A common variant of this strategy is to attempt to call the timeout right before the ball is snapped, so that there is not enough time to stop the play and the opposing kicker has to attempt the same kick twice.</li>\n<li>\"Icing\" is also used, albeit less frequently, in <a href=\"/wiki/Basketball\" title=\"Basketball\">basketball</a>.  In late-game situations with a player shooting free throws, it is not uncommon for the opposing team to take a timeout.  This is commonly referred to as \"icing the shooter\".</li>\n<li>The converse approach, suggesting a level of expertise far higher than the player actually possesses, can also be effective.  For example, although gamesmanship frowns on simple distractions like whistling loudly while an opponent takes a shot, it is good gamesmanship to do so when taking a shot oneself, suggesting as it does a level of carefree detachment which the opponent does not possess.</li></ul>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Other\">Other</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Gamesmanship&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Other\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<ul><li>If the players personally know and/or have experience with each other, lies and other conversation topics can be used.

Gamesmanship arises in this situation when, rather than passing the ball back to the side who kicked the ball out, the injured player's teammates keep the ball after the throw-in. Whilst not illegal or against the rules of the sport, it is heavily frowned upon.\n</p><p>A high-profile example occurred during the game <a href=\"/wiki/Battle_of_Nuremberg_(association_football)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Battle of Nuremberg (association football)\">Portugal vs. Netherlands</a> in round 16 of <a href=\"/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_2006\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"FIFA World Cup 2006\">FIFA World Cup 2006</a>, where the game, already marred by numerous cautions and even  red cards, further deteriorated because of such an incident.

In response to claims of feigned injuries during the 2006 World Cup, the Premier League has asked players, managers and referees to end the custom as of the 06/07 season, instead preferring a referee alone to determine whether a break in play is needed.\n</p><p>When a free kick is awarded, members of the defending team will often pick up the ball and drop it back behind them as they retreat.
