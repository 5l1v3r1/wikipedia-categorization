To keep player salary demands in check, team owners promulgated a standardized contract for the players, in which the major variable was salary. The players unsuccessfully tried to fight the growing <i>reserve system</i> by forming a union, the Brotherhood, and founding their own <a href=\"/wiki/Players%27_League\" title=\"Players&#39; League\">Players' League</a> in 1890, but the PL lasted just one season. For the next 80 years, the <i>reserve system</i> ruled the game.  In this era, all player contracts were for one year. There were no long-term contracts as there are today, because the reserve clause negated the need for them.\n</p><p>The Reserve Clause's inception was in 1879, when it was proposed as an unofficial rule known as \"the Five Man Rule.\" It would allow teams to reserve players for each season, unless a player opted out of his contract and did not play in the league for a year. While the rule was not secret, teams started to sign other teams' \"reserved players\", thus encroaching the rule. These controversies caused the <a href=\"/wiki/National_League\" title=\"National League\">National League</a> to instate the rule officially on December 6, 1879.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Teams realized that if players were free to go from team to team then salaries would escalate dramatically. Therefore, they seldom granted players (at least valuable ones) a release, but retained their rights, or traded them to other teams for the rights to other players, or sold them outright for cash. Players thus had a choice only of signing for what their team offered them, or \"holding out\" (refusing to play, and therefore, not being paid).\n</p><p>Under the <a href=\"/wiki/Sherman_Antitrust_Act\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sherman Antitrust Act\">Sherman Antitrust Act</a> of 1890, two or more non-affiliated companies in any other interstate business were prohibited from colluding with each other to fix prices or establish schedules or rates. Enforcement of the Act reached its apotheosis in 1910 when the Supreme Court affirmed the government's order to dissolve the Standard Oil conglomerate. Yet it was argued that to keep baseball (the only large-scale professional sport in America during the 1920s) prosperous, granting it immunity from the Sherman Act was in the best interests of the game and the nation.\n</p><p>Thus, the <a href=\"/wiki/United_States_Supreme_Court\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"United States Supreme Court\">United States Supreme Court</a> had held in 1922 in <i><a href=\"/wiki/Federal_Baseball_Club_v._National_League\" title=\"Federal Baseball Club v. National League\">Federal Baseball Club v. National League</a></i> (259 U.S. 200) that baseball was an \"amusement\", and that organizing a schedule of games between independently owned and operated clubs operating in various states, and engaging in activities incidental thereto, did not constitute \"<a href=\"/wiki/Interstate_commerce\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Interstate commerce\">interstate commerce</a>\" and therefore <a href=\"/wiki/Antitrust\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Antitrust\">antitrust</a> laws did not apply to such activity, a ruling that, as of now, has never been overturned, despite efforts to do in <a href=\"/wiki/Toolson_v._New_York_Yankees\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Toolson v. New York Yankees\">Toolson v. New York Yankees</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Flood_v._Kuhn\" title=\"Flood v. Kuhn\">Flood v. Kuhn</a>.\n</p><p>This pass on \"<a href=\"/wiki/Trust-busting\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Trust-busting\">trust-busting</a>\" essentially codified the reserve clause for many years, and gave what came to be known as Major League Baseball unprecedented power over both players and the independent organizations of the <a href=\"/wiki/National_Association_of_Professional_Baseball_Leagues\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues\">National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues</a> (NAPBL). MLB could dictate not only how and where professional players could move between major league clubs, but as they took the opportunity of the <a href=\"/wiki/Great_Depression\" title=\"Great Depression\">Great Depression</a> to establish systems of <a href=\"/wiki/Farm_team\" title=\"Farm team\">farm teams</a> of players wholly owned by the parent clubs placed on 'independent' teams from the NA leagues around the country, they developed a way of expanding control of contracts of virtually the entire pool of professional baseball players.\n</p><p>When other team sports, particularly <a href=\"/wiki/Ice_hockey\" title=\"Ice hockey\">ice hockey</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/American_football\" title=\"American football\">football</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Basketball\" title=\"Basketball\">basketball</a> developed professional <a href=\"/wiki/Sports_league\" title=\"Sports league\">leagues</a>, their owners essentially emulated baseball's reserve clause.  This system stood almost unchallenged, other than by the occasional holdout, for many years.\n</p><p>In October 1969, <a href=\"/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals\" title=\"St. Louis Cardinals\">St. Louis Cardinals</a> outfielder <a href=\"/wiki/Curt_Flood\" title=\"Curt Flood\">Curt Flood</a>  unsuccessfully challenged his trade to the <a href=\"/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies\" title=\"Philadelphia Phillies\">Philadelphia Phillies</a>.  Flood sacrificed the remainder of his playing career to pursue this litigation.  Flood's case established that the reserve clause was a legitimate basis for negotiation in <a href=\"/wiki/Collective_bargaining\" title=\"Collective bargaining\">collective bargaining</a> between players and owners,<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify\" title=\"Wikipedia:Please clarify\"><span title=\"Please clarify the following statement or statements with a good explanation from a reliable source. (August 2017)\">how?</span></a></i>&#93;</sup> and that the historic baseball antitrust exemption was valid for baseball only and not applicable to any other sport.  <a href=\"/wiki/Curt_Flood\" title=\"Curt Flood\">Curt Flood</a> unsuccessfully challenged the reserve clause in court in 1970, but <a href=\"/wiki/Marvin_Miller\" title=\"Marvin Miller\">Marvin Miller</a> helped overturn it five years later in the <a href=\"/wiki/Seitz_decision\" title=\"Seitz decision\">Seitz decision</a> in 1975.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Removing the reserve clause from player contracts became the primary goal of negotiations between the <a href=\"/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Players_Association\" title=\"Major League Baseball Players Association\">Major League Baseball Players Association</a> and the owners. The reserve clause was struck down in <a href=\"/wiki/1975_in_baseball\" title=\"1975 in baseball\">1975</a> when arbitrator <a href=\"/wiki/Seitz_decision\" title=\"Seitz decision\">Peter Seitz</a> ruled that since pitchers <a href=\"/wiki/Andy_Messersmith\" title=\"Andy Messersmith\">Andy Messersmith</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Dave_McNally\" title=\"Dave McNally\">Dave McNally</a> had played for one season without a contract, they could become free agents. This decision essentially dismantled the reserve clause and opened the door to widespread free agency within North American professional baseball.\n</p><p>Other sports soon followed suit.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"NFL\">NFL</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Reserve_clause&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: NFL\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>On June 18, 1921, the NFL ratified its first constitution.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Willis,_2010,_p._136._4-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Willis,_2010,_p._136.-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> The reserve clause ratified in the constitution was similar to that of baseball's at the time.

Fear of losing several future high draft picks greatly limited free agency as no team wanted to sign a veteran player only to learn that it would lose, for example, its next two first-round draft picks.  The Rozelle Rule was eventually replaced by \"Plan B\", which allowed a team to name a thirty-seven man roster the reserve clause would apply to, and all players not included on this list were free agents.  Obviously, few top-echelon players were left off this thirty-seven man roster unless they happened to be injured.  Courts eventually ruled this plan to be an antitrust violation, and something resembling true free agency came to pro football.  Now, exclusive rights to a player are only for the first three years after his selection in the college draft.  At the end of the first three years, a player can be a \"restricted free agent\", allowing his former team to match any offer made to him by another.  After four years in the NFL all contracts end with the player becoming an unrestricted free agent without reserve.\n</p><p>There is a <a href=\"/wiki/Franchise_tag\" title=\"Franchise tag\">franchise tag</a> option that is similar to the reserve clause; however, teams can only tag one player each year, although they can tag the same player for consecutive years.  Franchised players are eligible to receive at least 120% of their previous year's salary, and players tagged \"non-exclusive\" can accept offers from other teams; if the original team does not match the offer, they receive draft picks as compensation.  In recent years, many teams have opted not to exercise their right to designate the franchise tag.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"NBA\">NBA</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Reserve_clause&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: NBA\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"/wiki/National_Basketball_Association\" title=\"National Basketball Association\">National Basketball Association</a> went through several phases of compensation and other arcane provisions before reaching almost unrestricted free agency.

The appellate court, however, sided strongly with the WHA and Hull, calling the NHL's business practices monopolistic, conspiratorial, and illegal. While the reserve clause was not explicitly struck down, the court did effectively block any further injunctions based on the reserve clause, rendering it useless. (The WHA, meanwhile, voted at its founding to abolish the reserve clause.) The end of the reserve clause in hockey remains a significant part of the WHA's legacy, as it ultimately resulted in the evolution of the NHL's modern free agency system.\n</p><p>The highly contentious negotiations between <a href=\"/wiki/National_Hockey_League\" title=\"National Hockey League\">National Hockey League</a> owners and players that led to a <a href=\"/wiki/2004%E2%80%9305_NHL_lockout\" title=\"2004\u201305 NHL lockout\">lockout</a>, wiping out the entire <a href=\"/wiki/2004%E2%80%9305_NHL_season\" title=\"2004\u201305 NHL season\">2004\u201305 NHL season</a>, were in part about free agency; the previous system precluded unrestricted free agency before the player reached 31 years of age. Most younger hockey free agents were restricted free agents whose teams could retain them by matching an offer from another club or making a \"qualifying offer\", which usually consisted of a ten percent raise above the pay in the former contract. Following the 2004-05 lockout, owners eventually agreed to phase in a much lower age for unrestricted free agency (27 years of age or 7 years in the NHL, whichever comes first) in exchange for the players meeting owners' principal demand in the new <a href=\"/wiki/NHL_Collective_Bargaining_Agreement\" title=\"NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement\">NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement</a>&#8212;an overall <a href=\"/wiki/Salary_cap\" title=\"Salary cap\">salary cap</a>.
