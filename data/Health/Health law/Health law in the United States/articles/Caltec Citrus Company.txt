Caltec Citrus Company is a defunct business which in 1958 became involved in a legal battle with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA carried out surveillance of the Caltec warehouse. At this time it discovered substances not usually found in 100% pure orange juice being carried in a rear door by Caltec employees. Among these materials were sugar and Vitamin C. The loss to consumers in watering down procedures has been estimated at $1 million in lost value. Caltec was defended in court by attorney Percy Foreman. The corporation was fined $6,000, and a suspended sentence was given to the violating officials.
