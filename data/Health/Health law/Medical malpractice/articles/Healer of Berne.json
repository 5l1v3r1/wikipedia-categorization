He is accused of knowingly infecting at least 16 people with the <a href=\"/wiki/HIV_virus\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"HIV virus\">HIV virus</a>, and 14 of them were also infected with <a href=\"/wiki/Hepatitis_C\" title=\"Hepatitis C\">Hepatitis C</a>.\n</p><p>The acts were carried from 2001 to 2005 in the Swiss capital, <a href=\"/wiki/Bern\" title=\"Bern\">Bern</a>. A manager who in 2004 was jabbed in his back during the acupuncture treatment and subsequently was tested positive for the HIV virus set the medical investigation into motion. His clues were only followed up in a criminal investigation after several other patients accumulated at Bern's main hospital, the <a href=\"/wiki/Inselspital\" title=\"Inselspital\">Inselspital</a>, who also were infected with the same strain of the virus. The blood used for infecting the victim was, over the course of several years, drawn from a man who was promised a potential cure for his HIV infection. According to the criminal charges, two former girlfriends of the acupuncture therapist were also infected by him.\n</p><p>The trial at the regional court Bern-Mittelland began on March 6, 2013. The accused denied any involvement in the infections. When the trial opened, he hid for 24 hours in his home instead of arriving at the court, making a <a href=\"/wiki/SWAT_team\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"SWAT team\">SWAT team</a> necessary for apprehending him. On March 13, he was sentenced to 12 years and 9 months of prison for serious <a href=\"/wiki/Bodily_injury\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Bodily injury\">bodily injury</a>.\n</p><p>He appealed to the Obergericht of the Canton of Bern, as did the prosecutor. It then raised the sentence to the maximum allowed for bodily injury, namely 15 years of prison. Again, an appeal was made to the <a href=\"/wiki/Federal_Supreme_Court_of_Switzerland\" title=\"Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland\">Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland</a>, which confirmed the 15 years of prison in its ruling (decision <i>141 IV 97</i>), and rejected the plea to be acquitted for serious bodily injury, and instead be tried for minor bodily injury as well as proliferation of human diseases.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sources\">Sources</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Healer_of_Berne&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Sources\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Reuters.com: <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-swiss-healer-idUSBRE92L0NG20130322\">https://www.reuters.com/article/us-swiss-healer-idUSBRE92L0NG20130322</a>\n</p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw1250\nCached time: 20180908085839\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.004 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.009 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 11/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 0/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:50979620-0!canonical and timestamp 20180908085839 and revision id 788595720\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[{"lang":"de","url":"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_des_%C2%ABHeilers_von_Bern%C2%BB","langname":"German","autonym":"Deutsch","*":"Fall des \u00abHeilers von Bern\u00bb"}],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","*":"Medical_malpractice"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Acupuncture"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Bern"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Bodily injury"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"HIV virus"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Hepatitis C"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Inselspital"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"SWAT team"}],"templates":[],"images":[],"externallinks":["https://www.reuters.com/article/us-swiss-healer-idUSBRE92L0NG20130322"],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Sources","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Healer_of_Berne","byteoffset":1889,"anchor":"Sources"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Healer of Berne","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q15809258"}]}}
