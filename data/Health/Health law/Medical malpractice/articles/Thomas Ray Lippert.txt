Thomas Ray Lippert (1950â€“1999) was a former convict and former business law professor at Southwest State College in Marshall, Minn. who worked at a fertility clinic named Reproductive Medical Technologies Inc. in Utah from 1988 to the mid 1990s where he reportedly replaced customer's DNA with his own.   In 1974-1975 he was arrested and later convicted for kidnapping.     The website Was Your Child Fathered by Thomas Lippert? has been set up by CeCe Moore, a genealogist.  She created the site due to her concerns that other children may have been fathered by Lippert.  The site provides a comprehensive list of steps that should be taken, if a family is concerned with the possibility of Lippert's deceptions.
