The doctor did not inform her of the 9-10% risk of <a href=\"/wiki/Shoulder_dystocia\" title=\"Shoulder dystocia\">shoulder dystocia</a>, where the baby's shoulders are unable to pass through the pelvis among diabetic women as she viewed the problem being very slight and a caesarean section was not in the claimant's interest. \n</p><p>The baby suffered from severe disabilities after birth due to shoulder dystocia. The claimant sought damages from the health board for negligence on the part of the doctor for failing to advise her on the risk of shoulder dystocia. The Court of Session ruled that there was no negligence based on the Bolam principle and that there was no causation since the claimant would not have submitted to a caesarean birth even if informed of the pregnancy risk.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Judgment\">Judgment</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Montgomery_v_Lanarkshire_Health_Board&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Judgment\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The Supreme Court affirmed the requirement of 'informed choice' or 'informed consent' by patients in medical treatment that rests fundamentally on the duty of disclosure by medical practitioners. \n</p><p>Lords  <a href=\"/wiki/Brian_Kerr,_Baron_Kerr_of_Tonaghmore\" title=\"Brian Kerr, Baron Kerr of Tonaghmore\">Kerr</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Robert_Reed,_Lord_Reed\" title=\"Robert Reed, Lord Reed\">Reed</a> said: \n</p>\n<table class=\"cquote pullquote\" role=\"presentation\" style=\"margin:auto; border-collapse: collapse; border: none; background-color: transparent; width: auto;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"width: 20px; vertical-align: top; border: none; color: #B2B7F2; font-size: 40px; font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, Times, serif; font-weight: bold; line-height: .6em; text-align: left; padding: 10px 10px;\">\u201c\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; border: none; padding: 4px 10px;\">84. Furthermore, because the extent to which a doctor may be inclined to discuss risks with a patient is not determined by medical learning or experience, the application of the <i>Bolam</i> test to this question is liable to result in the sanctioning of differences in practice which are attributable not to divergent schools of thought in medical science, but merely to divergent attitudes among doctors as to the degree of respect owed to their patients.\n<p>85. A person can of course decide that she does not wish to be informed of risks of injury (just as a person may choose to ignore the information leaflet enclosed with her medicine); and a doctor is not obliged to discuss the risks inherent in treatment with a person who makes it clear that she would prefer not to discuss the matter. Deciding whether a person is so disinclined may involve the doctor making a judgment; but it is not a judgment which is dependent on medical expertise. It is also true that the doctor must necessarily make a judgment as to how best to explain the risks to the patient, and that providing an effective explanation may require skill. But the skill and judgment required are not of the kind with which the <i>Bolam</i> test is concerned; and the need for that kind of skill and judgment does not entail that the question whether to explain the risks at all is normally a matter for the judgment of the doctor. That is not to say that the doctor is required to make disclosures to her patient if, in the reasonable exercise of medical judgment, she considers that it would be detrimental to the health of her patient to do so; but the \"therapeutic exception\", as it has been called, cannot provide the basis of the general rule.\n</p><p>86. It follows that the analysis of the law by the majority in <i><a href=\"/wiki/Sidaway\" title=\"Sidaway\">Sidaway</a></i> is unsatisfactory, in so far as it treated the doctor's duty to advise her patient of the risks of proposed treatment as falling within the scope of the <i>Bolam</i> test, subject to two qualifications of that general principle, neither of which is fundamentally consistent with that test. It is unsurprising that courts have found difficulty in the subsequent application of <i><a href=\"/wiki/Sidaway\" title=\"Sidaway\">Sidaway</a></i>, and that the courts in England and Wales have in reality departed from it; a position which was effectively endorsed, particularly by Lord Steyn, in <i><a href=\"/wiki/Chester_v_Afshar\" title=\"Chester v Afshar\">Chester v Afshar</a></i>. There is no reason to perpetuate the application of the <i>Bolam</i> test in this context any longer.\n</p><p>87. The correct position, in relation to the risks of injury involved in treatment, can now be seen to be substantially that adopted in Sidaway by Lord Scarman, and by Lord Woolf MR in Pearce, subject to the refinement made by the High Court of Australia in <i><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Rogers_v_Whitaker&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Rogers v Whitaker (page does not exist)\">Rogers v Whitaker</a></i>, which we have discussed at paras 77-73. An adult person of sound mind is entitled to decide which, if any, of the available forms of treatment to undergo, and her consent must be obtained before treatment interfering with her bodily integrity is undertaken. The doctor is therefore under a duty to take reasonable care to ensure that the patient is aware of any material risks involved in any recommended treatment, and of any reasonable alternative or variant treatments. The test of materiality is whether, in the circumstances of the particular case, a reasonable person in the patient\u2019s position would be likely to attach significance to the risk, or the doctor is or should reasonably be aware that the particular patient would be likely to attach significance to it.\n</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20px; vertical-align: bottom; border: none; color: #B2B7F2;
