The Neuwirth Law is a French law which lifted the ban on birth control methods in December 1967. Following the great losses of the First World War, all birth control means and their promotion had been banned in 1920 to ensure population growth. However, some French people could still get information and products from abroad.  Several proposals had been made to unban birth control before 1966.  With some help from the French birth control movement (Mouvement français du planning familial ), French Representative Lucien Neuwirth wrote a law draft to legalize birth control in 1966.  He faced a violent opposition in his conservative political family, notably the government, and successfully pleaded the case to General De Gaulle, then President of the French Republic.  Formally proposed during the spring of 1967,  the Neuwirth Law was passed with left-wing support  on 19 December 1967.  It was promulgated on 28 December under the name ′law relative to birth regulation′.  The relative executive decrees were blocked by the conservative government, notably Jean Foyer, then minister for Health, some as late as 1974.  Jointly with the Veil Law of 1974 which unbanned abortion, the Neuwirth law allowed couples to reduce the number of both wanted and unwanted births,  leading to a decrease of the fertility from 2.5 to 1.81 children by woman in 1985.
