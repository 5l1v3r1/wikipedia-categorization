The Norwegian Institute of Public Health is responsible for maintaining and revising the list of notifiable diseases in Norway and participates in the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the World Health Organization's surveillance of infectious diseases. The notifiable diseases are classified into Group A, Group B and Group C diseases, depending on the procedure for reporting the disease  . Group A diseases are reported with full patient identification by clinicians and laboratories. The copies of notifications are sent also to Municipal Medical Officer of the patient's municipality. As of 2018, 60 diseases have been classified as Group A diseases. Group B diseases are reported to the Norwegian Institute of Public Health after de-identifying the patient. The month and year of birth, gender and municipality are reported. Copies of the notifications from clinicians are sent to the Municipal Medical Officer in the patient's municipality. This group of diseases includes gonorrhoea, HIV infection and syphilis.  Group C diseases are de-identified and the number of patients is reported from medical microbiological laboratories. This group includes genital chlamydia, Clostridium difficile infection and influenza-like disease (ILI). The number of Clostridium difficile cases are reported monthly, genital clamydia numbers are reported annually and influenza-like disease is reported weekly.
