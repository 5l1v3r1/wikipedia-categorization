The Caribbean Accreditation Authority for Education in Medicine and other Health Professions (CAAM-HP) is an accrediting body for medical, veterinary, and dental schools in the 15 member nations of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM).  CAAM-HP was established in 2003.  The US Department of Education's National Committee on Foreign Medical Education and Accreditation (NCFMEA) recognizes CAAM-HP as a standard comparable to the standards used in medical schools in the United States.  The departments of education from both United States and Canada contacted the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG) and has required that all Caribbean Medical Schools be at the standard of United States and Canadian medical schools, this led the CARICOM to create the Caribbean Accreditation Authority for Education in Medicine and other Health Professions (CAAM-HP)  organization who will be assessing Caribbean medical schools. Students of those schools that do not receive accreditation from CAAM-HP or another regional accrediting body recognized by the World Federation for Medical Education (WFME)  will not be able to complete neither USMLE examinations nor MCCQE, and therefore will not be able to become United States or Canadian doctors, if their school is not certified by the year 2023.   Schools in CARICOM member countries not appearing above have either not been assessed by CAAM-HP or are pending accreditation.
