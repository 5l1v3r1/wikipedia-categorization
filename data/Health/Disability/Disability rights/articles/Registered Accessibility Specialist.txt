A Registered Accessibility Specialist (RAS) is a professional licensed with the U.S. state of Texas to determine if a part of the built environment (building, park, sidewalk, parking lot) is compliant with Americans with Disabilities Act and state laws.  An RAS reviews construction documents to determine accessible design and inspects finished buildings to verify accessible construction.
