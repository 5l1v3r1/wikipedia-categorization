RespectAbility is an American nonpartisan nonprofit organization dedicated to empowerment and self-advocacy for individuals with disabilities. Its official mission is to fight stigmas and advance opportunities for people with disabilities. Started by one-time political consultant Jennifer Laszlo Mizrahi and philanthropists Donn Weinberg (its founding chairperson, from The Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Foundation) and Shelly Cohen in 2013. Its chairperson is Calvin Harris,  who has a background in social justice, public policy and philanthropy. RespectAbility is currently headquartered in Rockville, Maryland. The organization was recognized for its innovation by Slingshot.  It is also recognized by Guide Star at the Platinum level for its inclusion, transparency and excellence.  In 2017, a flag was flown over the United States Capitol in honor of RespectAbility’s work on behalf of Americans with disabilities. On June 3, 2018 the Maryland General Assembly gave an Official Citation to RespectAbility for its dedication and commitment to the inclusion of people with disabilities. Sulam presented RespectAbility with the Advocacy Leadership Award in June of 2018. RespectAbility is working to expand education and employment opportunities for people with disabilities and its president, Jennifer Laszlo Mizrahi, has published hundreds of articles on disability issues. On C-SPAN she outlined many of their goals.  RespectAbility has worked with 46 governors to help advance and realign state programs to help people with disabilities obtain competitive, integrated employment opportunities.   RespectAbility has provided testimony on disability employment in all 50 states and at the federal level.  One of RespectAbility’s main projects focuses on employment for people with disabilities in Long Beach, California. In November 2017, a resource guide  was published on resources for people with disabilities in Long Beach.  This was made possible by Long Beach Community Foundation and a grant from the Knight Foundation.   RespectAbility is working to change the narrative in Hollywood to ensure accurate and positive media portrayals of people with disabilities. RespectAbility is working with several partners within the entertainment industry on the full inclusion of people with disabilities, both in front and behind the camera.   Born This Way, which recently won an Emmy for best Outstanding Unstructured Reality Program in 2017,  stars seven diverse young adults with Down syndrome as they deal with issues around employment, independent living, education and romance. The show was created by RespectAbility board member Jonathan Murray. It was launched at an event on Capitol Hill hosted by RespectAbility along with Congressman Brad Sherman and Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers. Murray was recognized for this and other inclusion work by Variety.  The National Leadership Program, funded by the Ford Foundation, is a fellowship program which enables individuals with and without disabilities to gain experience in policy, development, fundraising, publicity and general political discourse surrounding individuals with disabilities and their integration into the community.  The fellowship program is divided into four categories: RespectAbility created a white paper that showed that youth and adults with disabilities are at special risk for the school-to-prison pipeline. Their publication, Disability & Criminal Justice Reform: Keys to Success  and was featured on PBS NewsHour.   RespectAbility is the parent organization for www.TheRespectAbilityReport.org, which covers the intersection of politics and public policy. It covered all the presidential candidates in the 2016 presidential campaign. Their political advocacy was featured in a segment on the PBS NewsHour,  The Diane Rehm Show,  page 1 of The New York Times,  and page 1 of The Washington Post  and NPR,  HME News,  The Atlantic  and other publications. The organization has come under fire due to its CEO Jennifer Laszlo Mizrahi's comments about race and the 2016 election. Although Mizrahi was making a highly technical (and probably incorrect) point about what might turn the election in favor of Hillary Clinton, multiple disability rights bloggers objected to Mizrahi's comments.    After Mizrahi's September 21, 2016 comments on her personal Facebook page, the organization stated Mizrahi did not speak for the organization on matters of that type in her personal blog.  However, the following day, Mizrahi spoke on behalf of RespectAbility USA when she was quoted on CNN about white disabled voters.  In response, RespectAbility issued an apology.  Later the organization issued a more detailed apology.  On August 16, 2017, the organization orchestrated an event called “Diversity, Equity and Equality in Hollywood” alongside Hollywood producer Jonathan Murray, known for his Emmy winning show Born This Way.  In conjunction with this, a focus group was held where people joined and talked about existing stigma and perceptions of persons with disabilities among Hollywood decision makers. The focus group was featured in Ability Magazine.  On July 31, 2017, RespectAbility held a summit at Rayburn House on Capitol Hill  in Washington, D.C., with speakers focussing on advocating for persons with disabilities in Hollywood.
