 Inspiration porn is the portrayal of disabled people as inspirational solely or in part on the basis of their disability.   The term was coined in 2012 by disability rights activist Stella Young in an editorial in Australian Broadcasting Corporation's webzine Ramp Up  and further explored in her TEDx Talk.   She rejected the idea that disabled people's otherwise ordinary activities should be considered extraordinary solely because of disability. Criticisms of inspiration porn include that it 'others' disabled people, that it portrays disability as a burden (as opposed to focusing on the societal obstacles that disabled people face), and that reducing disabled people to inspirations dehumanizes them.    The 2016 TV show Speechless explored the concept in an episode where it explains inspiration porn as "[the] portrayal of people with disabilities as one dimensional; saying to only exist to warm the hearts and open the minds of able-bodied people."
