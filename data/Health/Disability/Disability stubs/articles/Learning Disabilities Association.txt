Learning Disabilities Association of America (LDA) is an association of parents, educators, adults with disabilities, and professionals to address the difficulties created by learning disabilities, starting with the passage of the first federal legislation mandating a free, appropriate, public education for students with disabilities.  In 1963, a resourceful group of parents convened a conference in Chicago entitled “Exploration into the Problems of the Perceptually Handicapped Child.”   The professionals that participated and these parents shared a common concern: the recognition of the dire need for services for their children, services that did not exist. During the months that followed, many preliminary details towards formation of a national organization were worked out. With a core of volunteers agreeing to become its nucleus, the Association for Children with Learning Disabilities (ACLD) was created and incorporated in January, 1964.
