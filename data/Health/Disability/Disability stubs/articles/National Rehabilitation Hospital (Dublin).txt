The National Rehabilitation Hospital (NRH) in DÃºn Laoghaire, Dublin, is an Irish publicly funded hospital that provides rehabilitation treatment for patients who have a physical or cognitive disability due to illness or injury.  Although it is funded by the state the hospital is owned by a Catholic religious order, the Sisters of Mercy.  The Health Service Executive has been criticised for staff shortages at the hospital which caused twelve beds to be unavailable in March 2017 in spite of a waiting list of over 200 patients seeking admission.   The hospital has a total of 110 beds but is said to be under-resourced according to advocacy organisation An Soal as well as senior staff of the hospital.   Funding for an additional 120 beds was approved in 2015.
