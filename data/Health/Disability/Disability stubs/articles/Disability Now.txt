Disability Now is a UK magazine for disabled people, published by UK disability charity Scope. It was first published in 1984 as a newspaper and continued in that form until 2008, when it was redesigned as an A4 magazine with a greater emphasis on lifestyle and features.  During this time, current editor Ian Macare was hired, becoming the first disabled editor of Disability Now.  In 2012 it moved to an online only format, with the last print edition in September 2012.
