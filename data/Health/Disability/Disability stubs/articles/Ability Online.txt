Ability Online is a Canadian online community for children and young adults facing any sort of disability (intellectual or physical), chronic illness, or other social challenge.  The site was founded in 1991 by Dr. Arlette Lefebvre (aka "Dr. Froggie") from the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, Ontario, and Brian Hillis.  Membership is open to kids of all ages and their families and caregivers. Members are manually screened and verified prior to being given access to the site, and all public messages on the site are monitored by police-screened volunteers.
