Special education in Scotland is part of the national strategy to create a more inclusive society, where children with special educational needs have the opportunity to develop skills and to participate in society to the fullest possible extent. The Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004 redefined the law relating to the provision of special education to children with additional needs by establishing a framework for the policies of inclusion and generally practicing the "presumption of mainstreaming" in education. The Act is an attempt to broaden the narrow definition of Special Educational Needs (SEN) which has typically been used to define children with special needs.
