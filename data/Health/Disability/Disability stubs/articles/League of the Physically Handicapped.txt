The League of the Physically Handicapped in New York City was formed in May 1935 to protest discrimination by the Works Progress Administration (WPA).  The Home Relief Bureau of New York City stamped applications by handicapped applicants with "PH" which stood for "physically handicapped". Marked as "unemployable" disabled people were denied access to WPA-created jobs.  Members of the League held a sit-in at the Home Relief Bureau for nine days and a weekend sit-in at the WPA headquarters in June 1935.  These actions eventually led to the creation of 1,500 jobs for disabled workers in New York City in 1936.    The league had dissolved by 1938.
