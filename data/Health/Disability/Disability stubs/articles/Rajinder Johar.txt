  Rajinder Johar is a quadriplegic philanthropist who runs an NGO by the name Family of Disabled (FoD)  which looks after the betterment of disabled persons in Delhi in more ways than one.

After six years of depressions, he decided to help the disabled become self-sufficient and thus founded the Family of Disabled. Johar's service of the disabled over two decades has won him several awards and accolades.  Family of Disabled (FOD) was founded in 1992 by Johar, himself a quadriplegic who has been bedridden for the last 22 years.  Based in New Delhi, FODâ€™s mission is to build and nurture the capacities of persons  with disabilities through different sustainable interventions for improving their quality of life,  making them self-reliant and facilitating their mainstreaming
