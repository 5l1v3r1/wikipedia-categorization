Collette Divitto is the founder of the cookie company Collettey's Cookies. Collettey's Cookies is a company based in Boston, Massachusetts. Divitto has Down syndrome.  The company makes a chocolate chip cookie with cinnamon. Divitto graduated from Clemson University in South Carolina in 2013.   Two years after graduating Clemson, Divitto began looking for a job and didn't find one. She enjoyed cooking, and after friends and family that tasted her cookies suggested that they were good enough to sell, she decided to start her own company.    Collettey’s Cookies was founded in 2015, with help from her mother Rosemary Alfredo and sister Blake.  Her first retail account was Golden Goose Market, a store in her neighborhood, the North End.  The store was selling 100 bags of Collettey’s Cookies within the first week.  After a TV news segment about the company in the winter of 2016, which was amplified via social media, sales increased.  Fox 25 Boston reported on 17 May 2018 that Divitto currently has about 20 staffers and plans to expand staffing, equipment, and marketing.
