Topics on disability and religion may concentrate on the manner in which disabled people are treated within religious communities, the religious texts of those religions, or the general input from religious discourse on matters relating to the disabled.  Studies on the relationship between religion and the disabled vary widely, with some postulating the existence of ableism  and others viewing religion as a primary medium through which to assist the disabled.  Religious exhortation often prompts adherents to treat the disabled with deference, however when the disability constitutes a mental illness such an approach may be slanted with an acknowledgement of the latter's naivete.  In religions with an eschatological belief in divine judgment, there are often traditions promulgating an exemption from judgement in the afterlife for the mentally disabled, as well as for children who die before reaching maturity due to both lacking an understanding of their actions in a manner analogous to the mental disorder defense.  Regarding the rationale behind God's creation of disabled people, some religions maintain that their contrast with the able-bodied permits the able-bodied to reflect and God to subsequently assess the level of gratitude shown by each individual for their health.
