Creating built environments and facilities that are accessible and user-friendly equally to all, with safety and with dignity, is a right protected by law in many jurisdictions. It is an indispensable pre-requisite for social inclusion, focusing on equal opportunity and diversity.  Accessibility to the built environment affects a large number of people within society in their day-to-day normal life, concerning their safety and physical, mental and social well being. Even a single step can deny entry to a person pulling a suitcase on wheels, or a person using a wheelchair or even pose a safety hazard to anyone with impaired vision. Built Environments that do not comply with safety and accessibility standards, especially toilets and wash areas, ramps, steps and doorways, are often safety hazards posing unwanted risks to precious human lives, especially to increasing huge sectors of populations concerning the elderly, pregnant mothers, those with numerous debilitating conditions, those carrying small children and heavy luggage and also the dis-Abled persons.
