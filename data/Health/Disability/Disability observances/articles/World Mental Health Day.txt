World Mental Health Day (10 October) is a day for global mental health education, awareness and advocacy against social stigma.  It was first celebrated in 1992 at the initiative of the World Federation for Mental Health, a global mental health organization with members and contacts in more than 150 countries.  This day, each October, thousands of supporters come to celebrate this annual awareness program to bring attention to mental illness and its major effects on peoples' life worldwide.  In some countries this day is part of an awareness week, such as Mental Health Week in Australia.
