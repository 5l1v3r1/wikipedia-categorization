The Los Angeles Prehospital Stroke Screen (LAPSS) is a method of identifying potential stroke patients in a pre-hospital setting.  If all of these criteria are met (or not ascertainable) the LAPSS is positive for stroke. Patients may still be experiencing a stroke even if LAPSS criteria are not met.  A January 2000 study, conducted by 3 teams of Los Angeles-based paramedic units resulted in "sensitivity of 91% (95% CI, 76% to 98%), specificity of 97% (95% CI, 93% to 99%), positive predictive value of 86% (95% CI, 70% to 95%), and negative predictive value of 98% (95% CI, 95% to 99%). With correction for the 4 documentation errors, positive predictive value increased to 97% (95% CI, 84% to 99%)."  In a Chinese study, Beijing paramedics using the protocol, completed LAPSS screenings in an average of 4.3Â±3.0 minutes (median, 5 minutes). The study resulted in a sensitivity of 78.44% and a specificity of 90.22%.
