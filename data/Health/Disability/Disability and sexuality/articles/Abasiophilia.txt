Abasiophilia is a psychosexual attraction to people with impaired mobility, especially those who use orthopaedic appliances such as leg braces, orthopedic casts, or wheelchairs.  The term abasiophilia was first used by John Money of the Johns Hopkins University in a paper on paraphilias in 1990.   Abasiophilia plays a prominent role in the Michael Connelly novel The Scarecrow, in which a serial killer is motivated by abasiophilia.
