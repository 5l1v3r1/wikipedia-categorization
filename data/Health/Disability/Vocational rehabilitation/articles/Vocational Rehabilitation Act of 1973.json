Affirmative action programs were established in Title V, Sections 501, 502, 503, and 504. Individuals who qualify as having a disability have experienced discrimination both because of negative attitudes in regard to their ability to be an effective employee, as well as the physical barriers at work facilities. The Title V of the Vocational Rehabilitation Act requires private employers with federal contracts over $2,500 to take affirmative action to hire individuals with a mental or physical disability. While this means that employers must make reasonable accommodations for disabled employees, it does not mean they must hire unqualified individuals. There are additional sections of the Act that provide vocational counseling, training assistance and job placement for individuals with severe disabilities\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Legal_definition\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Legal definition</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Disease\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Disease</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Exceptions\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Exceptions</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#External_links\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">External links</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Legal_definition\">Legal definition</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Vocational_Rehabilitation_Act_of_1973&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Legal definition\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In the context of the Vocational Rehabilitation Act, the term \"disabled individual\" means \"any person who (1) has a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of such person's major life activities, (2) has a record of such impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment.\" This definition is closely related to the definition provided by the <a href=\"/wiki/Americans_with_Disabilities_Act_of_1990\" title=\"Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990\">Americans with Disabilities Act.</a>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Disease\">Disease</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Vocational_Rehabilitation_Act_of_1973&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Disease\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In the 1987 Supreme Court decision concerning the case Nassau County, Florida v Arline, it was ruled that employees that were infected with contagious diseases, such as tuberculosis, are considered disabled individuals and are therefore subject to the acts coverage. So long as the person is still qualified to do the job, employers are required to make reasonable accommodations to allow the disabled to continue working. Individuals with <a href=\"/wiki/AIDS\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"AIDS\">AIDS</a> are also considered disabled and are covered under the act. Recent public interest in AIDS has presented organizational management with the challenge of how to address work-related concerns about AIDS.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Exceptions\">Exceptions</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Vocational_Rehabilitation_Act_of_1973&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Exceptions\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The Vocational Rehabilitation Act does not require employers to hire or retain a disabled person if the individual has a contagious disease that poses a direct threat to the health and safety of others and the individual cannot be accommodated. Also employment is not required if the disability prevents the individual from being able to perform a required part of the job, or if the individual would be considered unqualified for the job regardless of their disease.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"External_links\">External links</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Vocational_Rehabilitation_Act_of_1973&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: External links\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.dotcr.ost.dot.gov/Documents/ycr/REHABACT.HTM\">Rehabilitation Act of 1973</a></li></ul>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw2184\nCached time: 20180913125235\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.036 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.054 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 83/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 4137/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 10/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 6/40\nExpensive parser function count: 1/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\nLua time usage: 0.016/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 818 KB/50 MB\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   40.540      1 Template:Unreferenced\n100.00%   40.540      1 -total\n 64.67%   26.219      1 Template:Ambox\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:9156657-0!canonical and timestamp 20180913125235 and revision id 779235888\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","hidden":"","*":"Articles_lacking_sources_from_April_2015"},{"sortkey":"","hidden":"","*":"All_articles_lacking_sources"},{"sortkey":"","*":"1973_in_law"},{"sortkey":"","*":"United_States_federal_civil_rights_legislation"},{"sortkey":"","*":"United_States_federal_disability_legislation"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Vocational_rehabilitation"}],"links":[{"ns":14,"exists":"","*":"Category:Articles lacking sources from April 2015"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"AIDS"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Discrimination against people with disabilities"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"United States"},{"ns":4,"exists":"","*":"Wikipedia:Citing sources"},{"ns":4,"exists":"","*":"Wikipedia:Verifiability"},{"ns":12,"exists":"","*":"Help:Introduction to referencing with Wiki Markup/1"},{"ns":12,"exists":"","*":"Help:Maintenance template removal"}],"templates":[{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Unreferenced"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Ambox"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Unsubst"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Message box"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:No globals"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Yesno"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Arguments"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Message box/configuration"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/data"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/config"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/shared"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/blacklist"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Namespace detect/data"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Namespace detect/config"}],"images":["Question_book-new.svg"],"externallinks":["http://www.dotcr.ost.dot.gov/Documents/ycr/REHABACT.HTM"],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Legal definition","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Vocational_Rehabilitation_Act_of_1973","byteoffset":1028,"anchor":"Legal_definition"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Disease","number":"2","index":"2","fromtitle":"Vocational_Rehabilitation_Act_of_1973","byteoffset":1508,"anchor":"Disease"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Exceptions","number":"3","index":"3","fromtitle":"Vocational_Rehabilitation_Act_of_1973","byteoffset":2172,"anchor":"Exceptions"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"External links","number":"4","index":"4","fromtitle":"Vocational_Rehabilitation_Act_of_1973","byteoffset":2656,"anchor":"External_links"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Vocational Rehabilitation Act of 1973","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q7939230"}]}}
