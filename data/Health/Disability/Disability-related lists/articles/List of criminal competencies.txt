List of criminal competencies is a listing of the various types of competencies relevant to the defendant in criminal law in the  United States. In the U.S. the  law is permeated with competency issues since a state may not subject an individual who is "incompetent" to trial on criminal charges. In insisting on this requirement the law is acting on the premise that society recognizes only the actions of an autonomous individual. This is a list of the most relevant competencies that must be evaluated (if a question of incompetency is raised) in order to proceed.
