A list of notable guide dog schools worldwide. Guide dogs (also called seeing-eye dogs) are assistance dogs trained to lead blind and visually impaired people around obstacles. In the United States, the name "seeing eye dog" is only used in reference to a guide dog from The Seeing Eye in Morristown, New Jersey, which has trademarked the term.  Guide Dog schools are accredited by the International Guide Dog Federation.
