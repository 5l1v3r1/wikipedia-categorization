Racerunning   is an athletic discipline for disabled athletes or 'racerunners'. Athletes use a running bike, a three-wheeled frame with a saddle, body support and most notably, no pedals. Athletes run over distances similar to other track and road running disciplines; 100, 200, 400, 800metres as well as 10kilometres, half and full marathons. The sport of racerunning   was founded in Denmark in 1991 by Paralympian Connie Hansen and present international racerunning coordinator Mansoor Siddiqi.
