Dark therapy is the practice of keeping people in complete darkness for periods of time in an attempt to treat psychological conditions.[medical citation needed] The idea originated in 1998 from research which suggested that systematic exposure to darkness might alter people's mood.  More recently, with the discovery of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells, it has been hypothesized that similar results could be achieved by blocking blue light, as a potential treatment for bipolar disorder.
