The prototype for the superhero was <a href=\"/wiki/Albert_Ellis\" title=\"Albert Ellis\">Albert Ellis</a> himself.

For the first time they also investigated the efficiency of the concept in promoting psychological health and in the treatment of psychological disorders in children and adolescents (see \"Meet RETMAN\" <sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>). The team developed the RETMAN concept in an innovative way, creating an entire system that includes: (1) <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://retman.ro/?page_id=12\">therapeutic comics</a>; (2) <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://retman.ro/?page_id=13\">therapeutic stories</a>; (3) <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://retman.ro/?page_id=14\">therapeutic cartoons</a>; and (4) the therapeutic system RoboRETMAN.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The Retman technology is being used by (selection) The Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinic, UMF, <a href=\"/wiki/Cluj-Napoca\" title=\"Cluj-Napoca\">Cluj-Napoca</a>, the \u201cPsyTech\u201d University Psychological Clinic at Babes-Bolyai, Cluj-Napoca, kindergartens and private clinical psychology/counseling/psychotherapy practices in <a href=\"/wiki/Romania\" title=\"Romania\">Romania</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\nIt is also used on the REThink Project,<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> a research grant with the goal to design, develop, and evaluate a therapeutic video game accessible over the Internet,  meant to be used primarily as a standalone application to promote emotional resilience in children and adolescents.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Concept\">Concept</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Retman&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Concept\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The concept was resumed by a team of designers and psychologists at the International Institute for the Advanced Studies of Psychotherapy and Applied Mental Health (link), led by \u201cAaron T.Beck\u201d professor <a href=\"/wiki/Daniel_David\" title=\"Daniel David\">Daniel David</a>. The institute was co-founded by the Albert Ellis Institute and <a href=\"/wiki/Babes-Bolyai_University\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Babes-Bolyai University\">Babes-Bolyai University</a>. The concept put forward by this team was a completely changed one, using the character <a href=\"/wiki/Superman\" title=\"Superman\">Superman</a> as a model for Retman. A planet was created for Retman (Rationalia), as well as new adventures and a dangerous opponent (the evil sorcerer Irationalius)\nThe stories of Retman are based on an original story, developed by dr. Daniel David: \u201c...Retman was the ruler of Planet Rationalia from the System of Ataraxia in the Happiness Galaxy. He lived in a town called Equilibrium and was a Great Sorcerer Psychotherapist, who is a person who helps you when you suffer and teaches you how to be happy. The Great Sorcerer Psychotherapist practiced \u201cRetmagic\u201d (a rational-emotional therapeutic magic). This gift had been given to him by the Almighty Creator of the World. All the inhabitants of the planet were happy because they had everything they wanted, but mostly because they wanted only what they knew they deserved. The secret of their happiness was therefore their minds and their way of thinking. But while Retman fostered rational thinking on the planet, his enemy, the Sorcerer Irationalius became envious of his power and stole the minds of the inhabitants of the planet. They became mean and envious and the whole planet was overtaken by evil and despair. Then the Almighty Creator of the World, in anger, destroyed everyone, sparing just Retman, as he was the only person whose mind Irationalius could not steal. He was sent on Earth with the goal of teaching everyone here to be rational and happy, so they wouldn\u2019t end up like the inhabitants of Rationalia...\u201d\nThe stories of Retman have been published in Romanian and English.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a
