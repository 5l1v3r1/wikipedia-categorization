Sachiko Murata (村田幸子, born 1943) is a professor of religion and Asian studies at Stony Brook University.   She is a 2011 Guggenheim Fellow.  She received her B.A. from Chiba University, Japan, and later attended Iran's University of Tehran, where she was the first woman ever to study fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) at that school. She received her Ph.D. in Persian literature, but shortly before completing her Ph.D. in fiqh, the Iranian Revolution caused her and her husband William Chittick to leave the country. Murata resettled at SUNY Stony Brook in Stony Brook, New York, where she teaches Islam, Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism.
