A fenceline community is a neighborhood that is immediately adjacent to a company and is directly affected by the noise, odors, chemical emissions, traffic, parking, and operations of the company.    Fenceline communities in the United States that are next to plants that emit hazardous waste are disproportionately inhabited by people of color and the working poor.    An example of a fenceline community is the African American Diamond community in Norco, Louisiana. This community lived on the fenceline of a Shell plant.    These groups of people are vulnerable communities who "fear that it may jeopardize jobs and economic survival" to organize to reduce their exposure to hazardous waste."  Additionally, residents in fenceline communities are often unable to relocate. This is because the large industries that have established themselves adjacent to the residential communities often produce effects that dramatically lower the property value of the homes in the communities. Therefore, residents are unable to sell their homes for a value that would be high enough for them to purchase property elsewhere.
