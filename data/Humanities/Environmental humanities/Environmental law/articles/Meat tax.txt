A meat tax is a tax levied on the carbon emissions of meat and/or other animal products. Chatham House, in a 2015 report called "Changing Climate, Changing Diets: Pathways to Lower Meat Consumption" has called for a tax on red meat.      Adam Briggs from the University of Oxford conducted a study that concluded that putting a carbon tax on high emissions foods (such as meat) could be a positive for both the planet and the health of U.K. consumers.   Scientists William J Ripple et al. have suggested the pushing up of the price of meat through a tax or emissions trading scheme.   Marco Springmann, from the Oxford University's Oxford Martin Programme on the Future of Food also proposed a tax on meat and dairy.  PETA is also calling for a tax on meat.  The Danish Council on Ethics  has called for a tax on meat in Denmark.  In 2017, the meat industry's Farm Animal Investment & Return (FAIRR) Initiative reports that meat taxes are becoming increasingly probable.   The momentum for a meat tax is not driven only by environmental concerns, but also by health  and humanitarian concerns.   Ag-gag laws criminalizing the gathering of evidence on animal suffering in the meat industry are adopted to try to slow the growth of humanitarian concerns that could reduce demand for meat and increase support for meat taxes,  but they are being countered by a growing movement to install compulsory CCTV in slaughterhouses
