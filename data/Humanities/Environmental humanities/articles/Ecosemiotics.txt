Ecosemiotics is a branch of semiotics in its intersection with human ecology that studies the sign relations established by culture, which deal with other living beings, communities, and landscapes.  The field was initiated by Winfried NÃ¶th and Kalevi Kull.  The central focus of ecosemiotics concerns the role of concepts (sign-based models people have) in designing and changing the environment. Ecosemiotics includes (or largely overlaps) with semiotics of landscape.
