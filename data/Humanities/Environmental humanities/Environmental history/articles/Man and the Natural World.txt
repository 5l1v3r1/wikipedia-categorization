  Man and the Natural World. Changing Attitudes in England 1500â€“1800 by historian Keith Thomas was originally published in Great Britain by Allen Lane in 1983. "A mixture of compromise and concealment has so far prevented this conflict from having to be fully resolved. It is one of the contradictions upon which modern civilization may be said to rest. About its ultimate consequences we can only speculate.". All page numbers refer to the Penguin paperback 1984 edition.
