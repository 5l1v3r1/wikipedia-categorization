As stated by the Chair of the Network from 2004 to 2006, Vladimir de Semir, the Academy looks for the necessary resources at international level to guarantee the access to the network of representatives from those countries that currently have to face more difficulties: \u201cThe main aim is to represent and include the multiplicity of identities existing in the world, because the study and practice of science communication should respect the different cultural contexts and integrate the knowledge coming from all continents.\u201d\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Teaching.2C_publishing_and_collaborative_projects\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Teaching,_publishing_and_collaborative_projects\">Teaching, publishing and collaborative projects</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Science_Communication_Observatory&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Teaching, publishing and collaborative projects\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The Science Communication Observatory runs a <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.idec.upf.edu/master-in-scientific-medical-and-environmental-communication\">Master in Science, Medical and Environmental Communication</a> in Barcelona (Spain) since 1995<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> and a Diploma in Science Communication in Buenos Aires (Argentina) since 2008 and other courses and workshops about science communication and the popularization of science.

The main theme of the conference was \"Scientific Knowledge and Cultural Diversity\" which opened up a field to debate on the global discourse of science in a range of local culture and knowledge environments. When talking about various cultures we are referring to the different groups sharing the same language, same traditions, ideology or religion, inhabiting in a specific geographical environment, having the same job, or being a man or a woman, a young, a child, an elder\u2026 All this rich cultural diversity also reflects its stamp on scientific knowledge, in its creation and application as well as in the whole process of public communication of science and technology.\nThe main theme of \"Scientific Knowledge and Cultural Diversity\", included 3 subthemes or discussion subjects.\n</p><p><b>Native Knowledge &amp; Modern Science</b>\nCultural diversity. Traditional knowledge. Local wisdom. Regional identity and globalization. Indigenous knowledge system. Citizenship participation on scientific decisions. Popular culture and scientific culture. Possibilities of native knowledge facing with new technologies. Science ethics and believes. Religion or morality influence in knowledge construction. Cohabitation between medicines with different evaluation systems. Knowledge, religion and beliefs. Parasciences. Science as a universal knowledge Intellectual property. Gender and cultural approach. New models, trends and concepts in PCST.\n</p><p><b>Science Communication: Historical Perspectives And New Trends</b>\nInfluences of historical processes on science communication. The greatest science communicators. The role of the mass media. The role of science centres and museums. Main initiatives in the promotion of scientific culture. Results analysis methodology.
