The Commission came into existence on July 12, 1974 when the <a href=\"/wiki/National_Research_Act\" title=\"National Research Act\">National Research Act</a> (Pub. L. 93-348) was signed into law. After four years of monthly deliberations, the Commission met in February 1976 for four days at the Smithsonian Institution\u2019s Belmont Conference Center which resulted in a statement of the basic ethical principles of autonomy, beneficence, and justice, for biomedical and behavioral research. The Commission recommended that the Belmont Report be adopted in its entirety as a statement of the Department\u2019s policy for the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare.\n</p><p>The Belmont Report\u2019s cause of origin can be traced back to December 9, 1946 when the American Military Tribunal started criminal proceedings against 23 German physicians and administrators for <a href=\"/wiki/War_crime\" title=\"War crime\">war crimes</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Crime_against_humanity\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Crime against humanity\">crimes against humanity</a>. During the trials, the <a href=\"/wiki/Nuremberg_Code\" title=\"Nuremberg Code\">Nuremberg Code</a> was drafted for the establishment of standards for judging individuals who conducted biomedical experiments on <a href=\"/wiki/Internment\" title=\"Internment\">concentration camp</a> prisoners. The Nuremberg Code in its final form was established in 1948 and was the first international document that advocated voluntary <a href=\"/wiki/Informed_consent\" title=\"Informed consent\">informed consent</a> for participants of research on human subjects.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Belmont_report_and_its_three_core_principles\">Belmont report and its three core principles</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Principlism&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Belmont report and its three core principles\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Principlism is a moral approach based on judgments that are generally accepted by most intellectual, cultural and religious traditions. For example, the Belmont Report defines 3 key principles by which to judge the ethicality of biomedical and behavioral research.  These principles are:\n</p><p>1. Respect for persons\u2014Autonomy,\n</p><p>2. Beneficence\u2014do good, and\n</p><p>3. Justice\u2014specifically distributive justice wherein those who bear the burdens of research also receive its benefits.\n</p>\n<table class=\"wikitable\">\n\n<tbody><tr>\n<th><b>National Commission for the Protection of Human Subject</b>\n</th>\n<th><b> of Biomedical and Behavioral Research</b>\n</th></tr>\n<tr>\n<th><b>1976 BELMONT REPORT Formalized in 1979</b>\n</th>\n<th><b>1976 BELMONT REPORT Formalized in 1979</b>\n</th></tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>PRINCIPLES</b>\n</td>\n<td><b>APPLICATIONS</b>\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>I.

The practicality of this approach is that principlism can be derived from, is consistent with, or at the very least is not in conflict with a multitude of ethical, theological, and social approaches towards moral decision-making. This pluralistic approach is essential when making moral decisions institutionally, pedagogically, and in the community as pluralistic interdisciplinary groups by definition cannot agree on particular moral theories or their epistemic justifications. However, pluralistic interdisciplinary groups can and do agree on intersubjective principles. In the development of a principlistic moral framework it is not a <a href=\"/wiki/Necessary_and_sufficient_conditions\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Necessary and sufficient conditions\">necessary condition</a> that the epistemic origins and justifications of these principles be established. Rather the sufficient condition is that most individuals and societies, would agree that both prescriptively and descriptively there is wide agreement with the existence and acceptance of the general values of autonomy, nonmaleficence, beneficence, and justice.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Specifying_and_balancing\">Specifying and balancing</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Principlism&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Specifying and balancing\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Once these principles have been established the practical activity then becomes that of specifying how the principles are to be used in specific situations and balancing the principles with the other competing moral principles. In using this approach, every moral decision will be dilemmatic in that the agent will be to some degree either morally right and morally wrong under a single principle, and/or there will be two or more competing moral principles and the agent will not be able to completely fulfill one or more moral principles without violating or competing with one or more other moral principles. Dilemmatic decision-making is not unusual when making pluralistic social decisions. The Bill of Rights in <a href=\"/wiki/United_States_Constitution\" title=\"United States Constitution\">the United States Constitution</a> perfectly exemplifies this process. A citizen\u2019s <a href=\"/wiki/Freedom_of_speech\" title=\"Freedom of speech\">freedom of speech</a>, for example, does not allow someone to yell \u201cFIRE\u201d in a crowded theater when there is no fire as individual <a href=\"/wiki/Constitutional_right\" title=\"Constitutional right\">Constitutional Rights</a> and Liberties are constrained by other <a href=\"/wiki/Individual_rights\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Individual rights\">individual rights</a> and liberties and therefore they must be specified for specific situations and then balanced with the other inevitable competing principles. \n</p><p>Principlism, presented as a formal criterion, is a <a href=\"/wiki/Linguistic_prescription\" title=\"Linguistic prescription\">description and prescription</a> of moral decision-making with a deep and rich heritage that has yet to be formalized for pluralistic interdisciplinary groups. However, since most moral decision-making ultimately use this approach, in one form or another, moral decision making in pluralistic environments is possible as Principlism descriptively describes how people do in fact make moral decisions and prescriptively prescribes how people ought to act based on the intersubjective agreements of common morality. Instead of focusing on the epistemic differences of various philosophical and religious perspectives, Principlism focuses on the intersubjective agreements, and that is why it works so effectively in interdisciplinary pluralistic environments.\n</p><p>Principlism could be modified by adding or subtracting certain component principles yet practically the four principles of autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice are broad and comprehensive enough to sufficiently cover most cases and will provide the necessary output power for making interdisciplinary moral decisions.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Incommensurable_beliefs\">Incommensurable beliefs</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Principlism&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Incommensurable beliefs\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Even though pluralistic groups will in large part have shared universal values\u2014Principlism, it is still clearly recognized that there is and will be incommensurable beliefs as to how the specification and balancing procedures found in the principlistic approach ought to be implemented. However, Principlism has the advantage over most other moral approaches in that Principlism emphasizes the shared interdisciplinary <a href=\"/wiki/Universal_values\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Universal values\">universal values</a> or principles and uses them in a systematic and transparent fashion resulting in a greater shared understanding and/or compromise. Certainly, Principlism does not claim to be able to solve all moral dilemmas caused by conflicts of beliefs, yet Principlism, without a doubt, has tremendous output power for practicing interdisciplinary moral decision-making. \n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Unified_approach\">Unified approach</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Principlism&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Unified approach\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Principlism is unified approach in that each <a href=\"/wiki/Morality\" title=\"Morality\">moral principle</a> seems to converge into each of the other three principles. For example, it can be argued that Principlism, as a comprehensive moral approach, is just another term for justice. To the extent that justice is socially valued because of how it effectively establishes autonomy, nonmaleficence, and beneficence, both personally and socially, it can be argued that Principlism only needs its fourth principle\u2014justice, in order to fulfill its moral function. However, this argument can also be made with regards to each of the four principles as each principle seems to be able to include each of the other three principles. Personal autonomy results in the maximization of personal benefits\u2014beneficence and the minimization of personal burdens\u2014nonmaleficence within a legitimate social structure\u2014justice. Likewise, nonmaleficence is maximized, by maximizing autonomy, beneficence, and justice and beneficence is maximized, by maximizing autonomy, nonmaleficence, and justice. \n</p><p>The fact that each of the four principles can be argued to be the supreme moral principle further validates the Principlistic approach towards moral decision-making. In other words, Principlism is a unified moral approach in which the addition of each principle strengthens the legitimacy of each of the other principles to the extent that each principle is specified and balanced using independent criteria and yet each principle still supports each of the other principles. \n</p><p>Science illustrates the importance and necessity of such unification. For example, if several academically distinct fields converge on a unified position that would generally give more credence towards that position. On the other hand, if one <a href=\"/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"List of academic disciplines\">academic discipline</a> has a hypothesis that contradicts several or all of the other academic disciplines, then that would be reason either to reject that hypothesis or at least to give it some pause. One example of such unification would be the comparison of evolution vs. <a href=\"/wiki/Creationism\" title=\"Creationism\">creationism</a>. Evolution converges in several academic fields such as Biology, Microbiology, Astronomy, Cosmology, Geology, Paleontology, Oceanography, Pathology, Medicine, Anthropology, and more. Creationism, on the other hand, is based on the non-academic discipline of <a href=\"/wiki/Faith\" title=\"Faith\">religious faith</a> and is not supported by any of the empirical academic disciplines. As a result, creationism does not have the same academic stature as evolution and is therefore not considered as a plausible option by any of the empirical or rational academic disciplines. Therefore, other than creationism being a curious sociological, anthropological, or psychological phenomena of culture, religion, and/or belief, creationism has no place in academic empirical rational discourse. Of course academic sciences are by definition limited to empirical and rational discourses and some knowledge is clearly not of that category.  For example, intersubjective experiences of <a href=\"/wiki/Sense_data\" title=\"Sense data\">sense data</a> such as: sight, taste, smell, touch, hearing, and emotional states such as: love, and faith, are real and true experiences yet they elude rational and/or empirical quantification. However, since creationism claims to be an academic empirical conclusion, then it is legitimate to hold creationism to academic standards of universal academic consistency. \n</p><p>Principlism validates itself with its universally recognized moral principles of autonomy, nonmaleficence, beneficence, and justice. These principles are distinct moral attributes that converge and unifies moral decision-making even within pluralistic environments.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Goal_of_moral_decision-making\">Goal of moral decision-making</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Principlism&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Goal of moral decision-making\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The goal in moral decision-making is ultimately to specify and balance each of the four principles recognizing that there is no set hierarchical order of principles in that one or more moral principle may override one or more other moral principles depending on the circumstances.
