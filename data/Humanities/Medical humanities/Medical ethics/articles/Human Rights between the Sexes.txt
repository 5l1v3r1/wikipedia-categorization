Human Rights between the Sexes is an analysis of the human rights of intersex people in 12 countries. It was written by Dan Christian Ghattas of the Internationalen Vereinigung Intergeschlechtlicher Menschen (the Organisation Intersex International (OII) in Germany) and published in October 2013 by the Heinrich Böll Foundation.     The countries studied were Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, New Zealand, Serbia, South Africa, Taiwan, Turkey, Uganda, Ukraine and Uruguay.  The report is believed to be the first comparative international analysis of the human rights of intersex people.  It found that intersex people are discriminated against worldwide.  Ghattas states: Intersex individuals are considered individuals with a «disorder» in all areas in which Western medicine prevails. They are more or less obviously treated as sick or «abnormal», depending on the respective society. Ghattas found that:   Nearly all over the world, intersex bodies are considered to be barely, or not at all, capable of being integrated into the social order. Ghattas makes five conclusions for human rights organisations: The book is published in German as Menschenrechte zwischen den Geschlechtern.    The book can be downloaded for free in either English or German.
