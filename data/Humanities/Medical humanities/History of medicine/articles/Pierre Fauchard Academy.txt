The Pierre Fauchard Academy is a volunteer-run, non-profit dental organization that was founded by Elmer S. Best, a dentist from Minnesota in 1936. The objective is the independence from commercial interests in dental research and its publications. Elmer Best endeavored to raise the professional standards. The Academy is named after Pierre Fauchard (1678-1761), a French dentist who is considered the "Father of modern dentistry". Fauchard wrote a book entitled Le Chirurgien dentiste, ou Trait√© des dents, the first dental textbook of modern times.  The statutes of the Pierre Fauchard Academy are based on the objectives of Elmer Best and its focus is on integrity and ethics of dentists. A primary objective at the time of its foundation is to preserve the independence of  scientific publications.
