\u2013 or the scientific inquiry and quest (<i>questio</i>) regarding vital nature was one that increasingly drew the attention of philosophers and scientists in the 1700s, following the great advances concerning the laws and principles of inert nature - the Copernican, Galilean and Newtonian revolutions in celestial and earthly mechanics - astronomy and physics. With great confidence and optimism, philosophy and science turned to the mystery of life, or rather, that of health - how to restore and maintain it. Those most immediately drawn to this field were those who had some concern with health issues, physicians in particular. Thus, a natural alliance formed between natural philosophy and science on the one hand and medicine on the other. What they had in common was to advance the discipline of the study of living functions or physiology.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Irritability\">Irritability</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Romantic_medicine&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Irritability\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Because of the influence of the inertial sciences and the success of the method used to gain knowledge of the laws and principles applying to inert nature, the initial approach was to apply the same method to vital nature. What emerged from this was the extensive study in the first part of the 1700s of \u2018irritability\u2019, this being based on the central nervous system and involving physical forces such as electricity and magnetism. However, the mechanico-material explanation was not fruitful when it came to actually dealing with life in the case of healthcare practitioners. Albrecht Von Haller\u2019s (1708\u201377) <a href=\"/wiki/Hallerian_physiology\" title=\"Hallerian physiology\">'irritability' hypothesis</a> and its failure adequately to explain the phenomenon of life, as well as the waning capacity of the Western mentality to participate living nature that lay at the root of the <a href=\"/wiki/Hippocrates\" title=\"Hippocrates\">Hippocratic</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Humorism\" title=\"Humorism\">system of humours</a> (or noetic capacities), led to a split between those who clung to the ancient tradition, but in name only (becoming routinists or empiricists), and those, largely in the universities, who sought a (material-mechanical) scientific basis regarding life and medicine. This split led to a widely acknowledged crisis in Western \u2018medicine\u2019 in the latter half of the 1700s.\n</p>\n<dl><dd>That medicine c. 1800 was caught in the throes of a foundational crisis is testified to by numerous sources and above all by the documented collective striving of all leading European countries to totally reform medicine. No later than the 1780s \u2013 as the sources clearly show \u2013 were the leading doctors aware of the critical situation.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Nelly_3-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Nelly-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup></dd></dl>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Romantic_medicine_and_dynamics\">Romantic medicine and dynamics</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Romantic_medicine&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Romantic medicine and dynamics\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The attempt on the part of philosophers and scientists to come to grips with the question of <i>life</i> led to an emphasis away from mechanics or statics, to dynamics. Life was action, living movement, a manifestation of an underlying polarity in nature and the universe. Instead of seeing nature from a \u2018one-eyed, color blind\u2019 spectator perspective, what was needed was a perspective that was binocular and participative. Inertial science had advanced in man\u2019s understanding of inert nature, her outer form or shell, what Francis Bacon termed <i>natura naturata</i> (outer form or appearance).  However, it was not capable of going beyond this to a more dynamic discernment or apperception of the living inner content of nature, the domain of life \u2013 life in general, not just <i>life biological</i> as Samuel Taylor Coleridge, at the philosophic core of the scientific effort to penetrate to natura naturans, put it, asking further \u201cwhat is not life?\u201d based on the understanding of life as a dynamic polarity between powers, forces and energies. As one observer wrote \"Die eigentliche Lebenslehre der Romantik aber war: Polarit\u00e4t.\" But as he promptly adds: \"Sie klingt uns \u00fcberall entgegen, nicht nur in der Naturphilosophie.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-Hirschfeld_4-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Hirschfeld-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_foundations\">The foundations</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Romantic_medicine&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: The foundations\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<h3><span id=\"Bacon.27s_Novum_Organum\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Bacon's_Novum_Organum\">Bacon's <i>Novum Organum</i></span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Romantic_medicine&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Bacon&#039;s Novum Organum\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The groundwork for this intensive search to understand life was laid down by <a href=\"/wiki/Francis_Bacon\" title=\"Francis Bacon\">Francis Bacon</a>, who sought to sweep clean the Augean stables of late medieval Scholasticism, with its increasingly obtuse and confused attempts to approach <i>natura naturans</i> (nature becoming or 'naturing') using the old Greek noetic capacity, already long lost to the Western mind and having gone underground into the arts, but also the nominalist straying into abstractions and refractions in their study of <i>natura naturata</i> via secondary phenomena as in Newton\u2019s study of color (cf. <a href=\"/wiki/Goethe\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Goethe\">Goethe\u2019s</a> <i>Farbenlehre</i> or Study of Color). Neither the Realists nor the Nominalists of late medieval <a href=\"/wiki/Scholasticism\" title=\"Scholasticism\">scholasticism</a> could handle the task before them, and Bacon sought, at the start of the Age of Science, to provide a method to approach nature\u2019s outer form rationally, but by means of a conscious use of man\u2019s higher faculty in the form of the \u2018forethoughtful inquiry\u2019 (\u2018lux siccum\u2019), that is, an inquiry that brought a particular idea, itself evinced through the mind and the domain of true philosophy, namely, the \"mind\u2019s self-experience in the act of thinking\" (Coleridge's <i>Biographia Literaria</i>), or epistemology. The Baconian approach was further developed by C.S. Peirce who made a distinction between induction and abduction: the latter being the method of discovering hypotheses, the former that of testing them.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Peirce_article_6-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Peirce_article-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Coleridge_and_the_role_of_philosophy\">Coleridge and the role of philosophy</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Romantic_medicine&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Coleridge and the role of philosophy\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Bacon's work provided what Coleridge termed \u2018method\u2019 \u2013 the derivation of laws or ideas to guide the mind (<i>mens</i>) in its observation of nature, out of which emerges understanding (concepts) and principles (reason). It is also the task of philosophy, as Coleridge emphasized, to \"settle the nomenclature,\" as the key to science is terminology where one term is not synonymous with something else, as is the case in demotic language, but instead the term discloses its meaning and increases understanding and knowledge. This was further developed by Heidegger and phenomenology (such as with the term <i>Veranlassung</i>).<sup id=\"cite_ref-Heidegger_7-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Heidegger-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Greek philosophy (love of wisdom or <i>sophia</i>) later emerged as philology (love of the Logos) to interpret philosophical works. It is this penetration of nature using both the eductive (as opposed to the projective) arts (innate wisdom) and (Logos-backed) sciences to achieve a rational, conscious understanding of nature, both outer form and inner essence that those who became part of the Romantic movement in England and Germany in particular, were seeking. It is not surprising that Romanticism, a scientific endeavor and quest, involved the cultural sciences or humanities (epistemology, philology, literature, poetry, music, etc.), as well as the natural sciences.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Search_for_method_for_vital_nature\">Search for method for vital nature</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Romantic_medicine&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Search for method for vital nature\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Romanticism rejected the application of the method that had worked so well for inert nature to the realm of living nature, or life biological. While living organisms contained a degree of a mineral, material nature amenable to being approached via the laws of material physics and chemistry, life itself could not thereby be satisfactorily explained. On the one side, the material scientists sought a solution in reducing the non-material or metaphysical to \u2018just\u2019 a manifestation of the material, essentially thereby ignoring that this did not at all account for life. On the other side, a part of the \u2018Old School\u2019, drawing from the Hippocratic humoral theory (involving non-mechanical, etheric concepts), sought to emphasize the non-physical or vital aspect of nature, which somehow existed above and outside of nature and directed its activities. The Romantic scientists and philosophers rejected both reductionist mechano-materialism (material natural science) and conflationist mystical-idealism (<a href=\"/wiki/Vitalism\" title=\"Vitalism\">vitalism</a>).\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Locke.2C_Fichte_and_German_Idealism\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Locke,_Fichte_and_German_Idealism\">Locke, Fichte and German Idealism</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Romantic_medicine&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Locke, Fichte and German Idealism\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Romanticism also involved a fundamental understanding of functional polarities as the basis for and essence of life as Idea, Law and Principle. One of these polarities in cultural history involved the seminal influence of the English genius and the germinal or gestational genius of German-language culture. Coleridge mentions this in his <i>Essays on Method</i>, and the theme is explored in D.E. Faulkner-Jones' The English Spirit.<sup id=\"cite_ref-English_Spirit_8-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-English_Spirit-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The seminal ideas came from Francis Bacon regarding scientific method and from <a href=\"/wiki/John_Locke\" title=\"John Locke\">John Locke</a> regarding the ideas of self-consciousness and mind. Locke set up a relationship between mind (subject) and outer world (object) wherein the mind is set in motion by objects producing sensations but also has an internal activity of its own (reflection) that acts on the sensations to create perception and conceptions. For Locke, the activity of mind is paramount, as for Bacon, and it is only through the activity of mind (consciousness) that the outer world can be \u2018realized\u2019 as causative and as actual. Identity for Locke lay in the capacity for the \u2018I\u2019 (consciousness) to unite disparate \u2018deeds\u2019 or actions of nature (as cognized by the mind), into a meaningful unity. For Locke, identity of self exists in nothing other than participation in life (the etheric) by means of fluctuating particles of matter rendered meaningful and real by acts of the mind and consciousness.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Nelly_3-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Nelly-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> The Romantics, as Locke, refused to accept the view that life is a product of \u201cthe chance whirlings of unproductive particles\u201d (Coleridge).\n</p><p>Locke\u2019s ideas were taken up by <a href=\"/wiki/Johann_Fichte\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Johann Fichte\">Johann Fichte</a> in Germany and developed into a philosophy of nature and natural science based on mind and consciousness, which he termed <i><a href=\"/wiki/Gnosology\" title=\"Gnosology\">Wissenschaftslehre</a></i>. Fichte, as so many of that time, was also inspired to challenge Kant\u2019s views on human freedom (constraints by material forces) and the limits to cognition, and sought this in Locke\u2019s emphasis on the mind and consciousness as the pivotal actor and creator of reality. For Fichte, selfhood (<i>Ichheit</i>) is an act not a thing or a substance, and being or identity consists in the acts of mind and self-consciousness, such that being and identity are co-operant. Fichte\u2019s work heavily influenced German philosophy and science, leading to a general system of thought known as German Idealism (including Schelling and Hegel), though this idealism would either end paradoxically in accepting the methods of material science for natural science (<i>Naturphilosophie</i> \u2013 Schelling), or in academic and lifeless dialectics (Hegel) that negate life rather than support it and used for political ends (Marxism).\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Idea_of_the_living_principle\">The Idea of the living principle</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Romantic_medicine&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: The Idea of the living principle\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Prior to Fichte\u2019s writings, the idea of life as a power and principle independent of and not reducible to matter or substance had been put forward in England and Scotland in the mid-1700s, by the philosopher, <a href=\"/wiki/Thomas_Reid\" title=\"Thomas Reid\">Thomas Reid</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/John_Hunter_(surgeon)\" title=\"John Hunter (surgeon)\">John Hunter (surgeon)</a>, a highly influential anatomist and surgeon as well as an observational scientist in the true Baconian tradition. Hunter rested the idea of the life principle on solid observation of nature. For him, anatomy and structure, matter and form were simply outer expressions of a vital dynamics.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Britannica_1911_9-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Britannica_1911-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>This idea found a receptive soil in German philosophy and eclectic medicine, as represented by <a href=\"/wiki/Christoph_Wilhelm_Hufeland\" title=\"Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland\">Christoph Hufeland</a> (1762\u20131836), which had developed the concept of a life force or energy (<i>Lebenskraft</i>)<sup id=\"cite_ref-Nelly_3-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Nelly-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>  as well, but one that had remained largely speculative or metaphorical. In 1781, Johan Friedrich Blumenbach, a natural philosopher and researcher published his thoughts regarding the  <i>Bildungstrieb</i>, a dynamic power that was evolutive, progressive, and creative.  Blumenbach\u2019s work provided for the later important distinction (by <a href=\"/wiki/Samuel_Hahnemann\" title=\"Samuel Hahnemann\">Samuel Hahnemann</a>) between a sustaining power (<i>homeostasis</i>) and a generative power (<i>Erzeugungskraft</i>), not just for procreation in all its myriad forms, but also creative acts of the mind, which Coleridge said involved the imagination (as opposed to fancy), both primary (unconscious figuration) involving perception, and secondary, the latter leading to apperceptive concepts as a result of conscious acts of the mind (ideas applied to perceptions).\n</p><p>All of this set up a climate for ideas and concepts that went beyond the mechanistic method of inertial science, one that allowed a role for creative actions of the mind (works of art) as well as reactions to sensations involving objects. Equally, the climate was conducive to considering a dynamic between subject (self and mind/consciousness) and object, one in which the mind is both receptive and pro-active, and also one in which the mind is critical to determining the meaning and reality of any given stimulation from the world outside.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Crisis_in_medicine\">Crisis in medicine</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Romantic_medicine&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10\" title=\"Edit section: Crisis in medicine\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>By the end of the 1700s, medicine, not only in Germany, but throughout Europe, was in a deep crisis.

R\u00f6schlaub wrote his doctoral dissertation on the work of a rather obscure and then little known Scottish physician, John Brown, <i>Elementa Medicinae</i>. Almost at the same time, in 1796, a German physician., Samuel Friedrich Hahnemann, who had been highly critical of the medical practices of his day, published a remarkable essay on the treatment of disease that became the foundation for the homeopathic approach to medicine, as part of a more comprehensive scientific approach for therapeutics he termed Heilkunde, and then later Heilkunst.

However, R\u00f6schlaub grasped, where no one else had been able, even Schelling with his <i>Naturphilosophie</i>, that Brown had provided the very elements of an approach to health and sickness that were dynamic in nature and by means of a synthetic concept \u2013 \u2018excitation\u2019 \u2013 that was the practical application of a Lockean and Fichtean approach to the problem of cognition due to subject/object or observer/observed, to the problem of the relationship between qualitative and quantitative, and also to the very problem of life itself. \"Brunonian doctrine therefore fulfilled Erhard's call for a medical practice based on the \"real\" causes of disease rather than on divination of the meaning of symptoms. ... where Erhard had offered only criticism, Brunonianism offered an alternative.

He might have been thinking of Brown\u2019s discussion of contagious diseases wherein we see this interplay between the general action (\u2018affection\u2019) of the sustentive power (excitability/excitement) and the more specific and different action of \u2018contagions\u2019 (e.g., LXXVI: \u201cContagious diseases are] not an exception...because...no general affection follows the application of contagion, if no undue excess or defect of excitement is the consequence...\"), or his reference to a pro-creative as well as sustaining power as in CCCXXVI (\u201cevery living system lives in that which it procreates\u2026that the system of nature remains and maintains an eternal vigour\u201d).\n</p><p>When added to his distinction between beneficial (\u2018agreeable\u2019) and harmful (malignities) \u2018excitants\u2019, Brown provided the basis for understanding how the level of excitability/incitability (potential) can be shifted upwards (potentiated).

In this regard, he made a distinction first between <i>Wissenschaftslehre</i> (natural science) and <i>Heilkunde</i> (the practical, clinical side of therapeutics), in which latter work he established the first teaching clinic, in concert with Dr. Markus, in Bamberg, Germany.\n</p><p>R\u00f6schlaub made a further distinction between biophysical (<i>Heilkunde</i>) and biomedical (<i>Heilkunst</i>). The second took him into the very dimension of life itself, the etheric, that is, beyond the physical, a dimension that required an entirely different organ of knowledge from the intellect or <i>Sinn</i> (<i>mens</i>) that was the foundation of both <i>WissenschaftsHeillehre</i> and <i>Heilkunde</i>, as the construction of a protocol entails <i>arte</i>. Unbeknownst to him, one of his countrymen had been working on the development and understanding of this new cognitive capacity, called the <i>Gem\u00fct</i>. As a result, Goethe was able to \u2018see\u2019 (<i>anschauende Erkenntnis</i>) into the dynamic realm of nature (<i>natura naturans</i>) and comprehend the very movement behind the forms, and the very functions that determined a given form, including the dynamic archetype (<i>Kraftwesen</i>) out of which all forms of a given Idea (such as \u2018plant\u2019 or \u2018animal\u2019) emanated. It was Goethe who founded the science of morphology. Although Goethe termed this study <i>Metamorphosenlehre</i>, it was, more accurately stated, a pleomorphic process.\n</p><p>This new cognitive capacity is what was needed for the physician or <i>Leibarts</i> to go beyond the inner  symptomatics and outer semiotics of a case as a basis for assessment and evaluation used by the Old School, and to avoid the pitfalls of the merely empirical approach.

Hahnemann\u2019s essay of 1796 and subsequent writings, all part of an extended <i>Organon der Heilkunst</i>, laid down the basic foundation for a distinction between the sustentive (<i>Lebenserhaltungskraft</i>) [Aphorism 63, 205 fn., 262) and generative (<i>Erzeugungskraft</i>) [Aphorism 21-22] sides of the living principle, between physic, operating under the natural healing law of opposites (<i>contraria contrarius</i>), and medicine proper, operating under the natural curative law of similars (similia similibus), and between disease, a dynamica impingement on the generative power (degeneration), a derangement of the sustentive power, or disturbance of <i>homeostasis</i>.\n</p><p>Hahnemann further established various principles for the application of the law of similars, including a crucial distinction between diseases of a fixed nature (tonic diseases), and those of a variable nature, the basis for the later discovery by some of his followers of a dual remedy prescribing, each remedy addressing one \u2018side\u2019 of disease, the tonic and pathic sides. Hahnemann set out a comprehensive approach to the diagnosis and treatment of disease, including a nosology.<sup id=\"cite_ref-DL_14-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-DL-14\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Details_of_Heilkunst\">Details of Heilkunst</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Romantic_medicine&amp;action=edit&amp;section=14\" title=\"Edit section: Details of Heilkunst\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>Hahnemann argued, logically, that the material effects of disease could not be their own cause (<i>causa morbii</i>). Disease was instead a dynamic affection of the generative power occasioned by a spirit-like morbid entity (Krankheitswesen) [Aphorisms 22, 28] that had the power to impinge upon the generative power of a human (Menschenkraftwesen) [Aphorism 289 fn.], acting as malignant \u2018excitants\u2019 in the Brunonian sense. However, this power depended on a susceptibility or receptivity (negative resonance) caused by weakening of the life force from various malignities (Brown\u2019s underlying diathesis).\n</p><p>The disease process consists of a dual action: the initial action (<i>Eerstwirkung</i>) [Aphorisms 70,62,64,65] of the disease agent, which impinges upon the generative power, which is generally imperceptible (such as the initial infection by the measles microbe), and the counter or after-action (<i>Gegenwirkung</i> [Aph. 63,112, 115], <i>Nachwirkung</i>) [Aph. 62,70, 71] of the sustentive power, which produces the various sufferings the patient complains about.\n</p><p>While the fixed nature of tonic diseases could be identified by <i>discerning</i> the underlying causal state of mind, along with a curative medicine based on fixed principles, the variable or pathic diseases could only be identified, along with their curative medicine, through the symptoms (suffering or <i>pathos</i>) produced by the disease in the patient. However, such an approach was problematic as a person could have more than one disease at a time (Aph. 40-44). This then required a principle to organize the symptoms into an identifiable <i>complex</i> (<i>Inbegriff</i>) correspondent to a given disease state. Just as each tonic disease has a unique state of mind disturbance, so does each pathic disease contain a unique disturbance of the thermal organization in man. This approach to pathic diseases Hahnemann termed <i>homeopathy</i> (from the Greek <i>homoios</i> and <i>pathos</i>, or similar suffering). This approach expanded empiricism from its limitation within the bounds of <i>Erfahrung</i> (experience of outer forms or <i>natura naturata</i>) to <i>Erlebnis</i> provings (experience via the life body of <i>natura naturans</i>).\n</p><p>The tonic diseases were to be found in various jurisdictions: homotoxic (toxins), homogenic (physical and emotional traumas), pathogenic, iatrogenic and ideogenic (spiritual diseases engendered by false belief, which he termed the \"highest diseases\" - as compared to the \u2018deepest\u2019 pathic diseases). The pathic diseases are found in reversible layers (\u2018layers prescribing\u2019).<sup id=\"cite_ref-Eizayaga_15-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Eizayaga-15\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Because the pathic diseases generally arise out of the more primary constant (tonic) diseases, such as the chronic diseases that arise out of the chronic miasms, Hahnemann also laid down the principle that the tonic diseases should be treated first, and second any remaining pathic diseases.\n</p>\n<dl><dd>In order to treat successfully the other cases of disease occurring in man, and which, be they acute or chronic, differ so vastly among each other [pathic], if they cannot be referred to some primary  disease which is constant in its character [tonic], they must each be regarded as peculiar diseases, and a medicine which in its pure effects on the healthy body shows symptoms similar to those of the case before us, must be administered.

The problem lay in that a patient could present with more than one disease, each with a particular grouping of symptoms, but how could the practitioner link which symptoms manifest disorder(s) and of those ascribable to disease, and to which disease of the several possible at a given time in the patient, and finally, how could one trace any symptoms so identified to their origins? Here Hahnemann\u2019s genius adduced a living experience (<i>Erlebnis</i>) of the essence of a natural substance (<i>Naturwesen</i>) by way of a human prover, and in doing so, also provided the very practical scientific basis for removing the barrier set up by Kantian intellect between observer and observed, by invoking the cognitive capacity of Goethe\u2019s <i>Gem\u00fct</i> (Aphorism 253 of the <i>Organon der Heilkunst</i>). Goethe himself, later in his life, recognized that Hahnemann had found a way to apply to and through human nature what he was doing with Mother Nature.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Haehl113_16-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Haehl113-16\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In the light of difficulties treating more complex cases, Hahnemann undertook further research and developed a theory of chronic miasms, which are fixed nature diseases of the pathogenic type (originally infectious, but also inherited) which give rise to all the (secondary) chronic diseases, which are pathic in nature (cf. R\u00f6schlaub's <i>Pathogenesis</i>).  Hahnemann also gave indications as to when the practitioner could tell that the disease had been cured by the similar medicine and healing was underway (the complete process termed \"heilen\" or remediation). Constantine Hering, often called the Father of Homeopathy in the US, further developed these guidelines, which are often referred to as \"Hering's Law or Principles\"&#160;:\n</p>\n<ul><li>from less vital to more vital organs</li>\n<li>in the case of pain, from above down</li>\n<li>in the same direction as the natural disease process.</li></ul>\n<p>This was later expanded in the latter half of the 19th century by Dr. James Tyler Kent who noticed that when disease was suppressed or several groups of symptoms (diseases) developed in a patient over time, that the remedial process proceeded in the reverse order of their emergence. This provides the basis for a sequential treatment of diseases.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Kent_17-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Kent-17\">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup> If some symptoms become worse some time after the similar medicine or there is even a return of old symptoms, essentially in chronic, complex cases, this Hahnemann identified as part of the healing process, which involves the counteraction of the sustentive power of the <i>Kraftwesen</i> against the medicine (similar \u2018disease\u2019).[Aph. 63-64]\n</p><p>While medicine had historically recognized, even into Hahnemann's time, the law of similars (similia similibus), it was also wary of its use because of risk of harm with the improper dose, and had largely abandoned it in favor of the other approach set out by Hippocrates involving the law of opposites, that is, acting to support the <i>physis</i> or sustentive power. Dr. Hahnemann discovered a way to attenuate the dose so that it could be rendered harmless but remain therapeutically active, what is often referred to as \u2018dynamization\u2019. Later he also discovered a way in which to sublimate, or the increase in dynamic power, of medicines (cf. Brown's sthenic enhancement).\n</p><p>Because of the use of these two laws, we have two great realms of therapeutics: medicine proper, (medic-al) which is the application of the law of similars, and physic-al, which is the application of the law of opposites. This gives us the mutually interactive and supportive jusrisdictions of the true <i>Heilkundiger</i> and <i>Heilk\u00fcnstler</i> \u2013 physician and medician, involving respectively a \"physic\" approach based on the law of opposites and a \"medic\" approach based on the law of similars.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Compeers.2C_not_rivals\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Compeers,_not_rivals\">Compeers, not rivals</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Romantic_medicine&amp;action=edit&amp;section=15\" title=\"Edit section: Compeers, not rivals\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Dr. Brown provided the essential elements for a new, functional (actions of powers, forces and energies) approach to understanding life and health, which insights were elaborated by Drs.

Goethe's morphological insights provide the theoretical basis for Hahnemann's empirical discoveries and living experiments ('provings' or <i>Erlbenisse</i>). In these provings, Hahnemann sought to contemplate the movement, the flow and transformation of a disease state (<i>Gestalt</i>), not just an abstract image. Hahnemann also had a Goethean understanding of the sequential nature or unfolding of a disease phenomenon.\n</p><p>In Hahnemann\u2019s distinction between the two sides of the <i>Lebenskraft</i> \u2013 the sustentive or <i>Erhaltungskraft</i> and the generative or <i>Erzeugungskraft</i> (<i>Bildungstrieb</i>), we find the polar logic identified in Goethe\u2019s <i>Chromatology</i> \u2013 \u2018the sufferings and deeds of light\u2019 via a turbid medium, in the struggle between light energy (<i>Licht</i>) and the now identified 'dark' energy (<i>Finsternis</i>). We also find this polarity, as well as Goethe's distinction between the spectrum of dark and of light, in the distinction Hahnemann made between primary or tonic disease (based on a super-sensible knowing of psychic states involving alterations in circumstances, occurrents and behaviors via the Goethean <i>Gem\u00fct</i> or super-sensible cognitive organ) and secondary or pathic disease (based on the sensible manifestation of life energy at the somatic level in terms of feelings, functions and sensations, as well as signs). For Goethe the turbid medium is the atmosphere (airy realm), for Hahnemann it is the living organism (fluid or etheric realm). Goethe's interplay of <i>Licht</i> and <i>Finsternis</i> can also be seen in Hahnemann's polarity between <i>Geist</i> (Spirit) and <i>Wesen</i> (Dynamis).\n</p><p>The objections that Goethe leveled against the taxonomy of Linnaeus in botany can be found in the medical sphere in Hahnemann\u2019s criticism of the blindly empirical or abstractly intellectual nosology of his time that took a few outer elements, arbitrarily conflated them, then confounded similarity of appearance here with identity of cause and origin.  Hahnemann\u2019s criticism also was based on an historical study of the morphology of this medical state of mind or <i>Kurwesen</i>, much as Goethe considered the study of history of a phenomenon as a form of knowledge (as did the Greeks).\nEqually, Hahnemann was critical of a static approach to disease nosology, which was constantly shape-shifting as the interaction between <i>Krankheitwesen</i> and <i>Menschenwesen</i> expressed different aspects of the same underlying disease (these being considered different diseases in the static Linnean nosology of materialistic medicine).  Hahnemann also understood that there was an element of fixity and variability to disease (found in his distinction (1796) between primary (tonic) and secondary (pathic) diseases, just as Goethe accepted a degree of form and structure at the physical level whilst pointing to the underlying dynamics leading to new forms over time (Darwin\u2019s adaptation).\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Lutze_and_Sch.C3.B6nlein\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Lutze_and_Sch\u00f6nlein\">Lutze and Sch\u00f6nlein</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Romantic_medicine&amp;action=edit&amp;section=17\" title=\"Edit section: Lutze and Sch\u00f6nlein\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The works of Hahnemann and R\u00f6schlaub were continued and furthered by Drs. <a href=\"/wiki/Arthur_Lutze\" title=\"Arthur Lutze\">Arthur Lutze</a> and Johan Sch\u00f6nlein (1793\u20131864) respectively. Lutze (1813\u20131870) took the foundations of Hahnemann\u2019s approach to disease and placed it on a solid romantic footing in consciously and consistently applying dual remedy prescribing (tonic and pathic disease associations in a given patient).\n</p><p>Where Hahnemann had hesitated and eventually withdrew his public support in the 5th edition of his <i>Organon der Heilkunst</i> for dual remedy prescribing, having been unable yet to establish a principle upon which to ground it rationally (what is known as the \u2018dual remedy affair\u2019), Lutze later re-issued the 5th edition with the withdrawn dual remedy section and clinically practiced based on such an approach.

This foundation is one based on natural science, but also on the <i>arte</i> (Pascal's <i>spirit of finesse</i>) of the practitioner, which is something objective and reproducible though based on a different logic and involving more fugitive causes (allopathic \u2018medicine\u2019 accepting only the first and then only natural inertial science, not a true physiology of functions, both physical and etheric)\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_schism\">The schism</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Romantic_medicine&amp;action=edit&amp;section=18\" title=\"Edit section: The schism\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Up until the middle of the 19th century, following the pioneering work of Brown, Hahnemann, R\u00f6schlaub, Lutze and Sch\u00f6nlein, to mention only the main figures, the scientific approach to the question of life, particularly as reflected in the development of Healthcare, seemed conducive to the development of a method that was based on a cognitive capacity going beyond mere mentation (<i>Sinn</i> or <i>mens</i>) and a true physiology involving living functions rather than simply mechanics and chemistry. However, it seemed that the Zeitgeist (Spirit of the Times) could not yet accept such an approach, most minds being still fully ensconced in the intellectual phase (Coleridge's \"epoch of the intellect and the senses\") of human consciousness. It was only the extraordinary mind of genius that was able at this stage to meet the challenge of a true science of life and mind, what Colerdige termed the \u201cDynamic System of Thought.\u201d\n</p><p>As a result, the analytical approach favored by the French, schooled in the Cartesian system of mind-body duality, and with their significant advances in surgery (albeit based on access to and development of original Greek medical writings and more modern Greek surgical practice), came to dominate Western science.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Nelly_3-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Nelly-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>  In Germany, the work of <a href=\"/wiki/Rudolf_Virchow\" title=\"Rudolf Virchow\">Rudolf Virchow</a>, while drawing from the advances made by Romantic science, effectively reduced and simplified them more in line with what the intellect was able to grasp. The achievements of Romantic Science and Medicine could not be denied, but neither could they be accepted; instead, the followers of the Romantic tradition were either denigrated as considered misguided, occult, and ultimately dreamers rather than serious scientists. The following historiographic assessment is the one that has generally prevailed until recently.\n</p>\n<dl><dd>Around the middle of the 1800s, medicine makes a gigantic surge into a critical, empirical-analytical research project: Virchow's demand for a strict, natural [inertial] scientific method then enabled medical thinking to disentangle itself from the flowery and thorny fields of romantic Naturphilosophie and to transplant itself into the earth of natural scientific-analytic procedure. (Schrenk 1973)<sup id=\"cite_ref-Nelly_3-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Nelly-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup></dd></dl>\n<p>Virchow\u2019s cellular theory provided the supposed basis for life, without explaining it, and superseded the ancient, and by now denigrated humoral theory (because the noetic capacity to diagnose at this etheric level had waned). As such, chemistry and physics could become the basis for medicine, all the more in that medicine effectively had been reduced to surgery and chemistry, the latter due to Pasteur\u2019s \u2018germ theory\u2019 of disease (really an unproven hypothesis and where proven according to strict requirements of Koch\u2019s postulates, still not fully explanatory in terms of the concepts and reality of \u2018susceptibility\u2019 and \u2018immunity\u2019, which contemporaries of Pasteur, such as B\u00e9champ and Claude Bernard, sought to address).\n</p><p>The problem of life was to be \u2018solved\u2019 by Virchow\u2019s cellular hypothesis as the basis of life, which conveniently posited life within medicine without having to explain it.\nThus, as N. Tsouyopoulos points out, Western \u2018medicine\u2019 was effectively reduced to surgery and emergency drug treatments, possessing no basis to deal with chronic, complex disorders or diseases having rejected the dynamic approaches developed by the Brunonian orientation, as developed in general terms (physic and physiology) by R\u00f6schlaub/Sch\u00f6nlein and Saumarez, and in particular regarding disease (medicine and pathology) by Hahnemann/Lutze. As one reviewer of Tsouyopoulos' major work on romantic medicine summarized: \"Romantic medicine was to fall into disfavour as the positivist approach from France gained ground, to the point where Karl August Wunderlich in 1859 dismissed it as mere hollow theory divorced from all empiricism, a myth that survived for nearly a century.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-Reeves_21-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Reeves-21\">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>To the extent that human physiology contains a physical/chemical aspect (broken bones, impinging tumours on vital nerves, severed arteries, or severe tissue damage, significant hormonal or chemical imbalances, severe microbial invasion, and the like), a mechanic-material approach will produce effective results, witness the \u2018miracles\u2019 of Western emergency medicine, but in the realm of internal \u2018medicine\u2019, there are no cures, only the suppression of symptoms or long-term disease and disorder management using chemical means, mostly synthetic, the intellect seeing no difference between a natural \u2018chemical\u2019 and a synthesized one. As one writer summarizes: \"Alongside of English and French medicine of that time, whose significance was never under-appreciated, German Romantic Medicine comes off in no way as inferior or reactionary. Its contribution to overcoming the foundational crisis in medical history and for founding a scientific clinic is substantial and decisive for the whole of later developments...today, in our searching for new models and alternatives in medicine, Romantic Medicine lies closer to home than the so-called natural\nscientific medicine of the later 1800s and early 1900s.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-Nelly_3-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Nelly-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Contemporary_use\">Contemporary use</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Romantic_medicine&amp;action=edit&amp;section=19\" title=\"Edit section: Contemporary use\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In 2017, Kamiar-K.
