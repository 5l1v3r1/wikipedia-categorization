Social Emergency Medicine is an emerging branch of Emergency Medicine that explores the interplay of social forces and the emergency care system, and how these act together to affect the health of individuals and their communities. Organized in 2009, the field has gained wider acceptance within the larger specialty of emergency medicine. Initiatives in social emergency medicine include research, direct service and advocacy in hunger, unstable housing, community violence  and other social determinants of health.   The term “Social Emergency Medicine” traces its origins to 2009, when emergency physicians at Highland Hospital in Oakland, California, formed the Andrew Levitt Center for Social Emergency Medicine, an independent non-profit research and advocacy institute.  As of 2016, fellowships in Social Emergency Medicine can be found also at The University of California, Los Angeles , Stanford University, and St Barnabas Hospital (Bronx) . In 2017 the American College of Emergency Physicians  approved the creation of a Social Emergency Medicine Section, and in the same year the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine authorized the Social Emergency Medicine and Population Health Interest Group.
