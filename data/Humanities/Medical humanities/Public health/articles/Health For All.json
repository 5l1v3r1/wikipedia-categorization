It is the basis for the World Health Organization's <a href=\"/wiki/Primary_health_care\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Primary health care\">primary health care</a> strategy to <a href=\"/wiki/Health_promotion\" title=\"Health promotion\">promote health</a>, human dignity, and enhanced quality of life.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Definition\">Definition</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Health_For_All&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Definition\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/Halfdan_Mahler\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Halfdan Mahler\">Halfdan Mahler</a>, Director General (1973-1983) of the WHO, defined Health For All in 1981, as follows:<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>Health For All means that health is to be brought within reach of everyone in a given country. And by \"health\" is meant a personal state of well being, not just the availability of health services \u2013 a state of health that enables a person to lead a socially and economically productive life. Health For All implies the removal of the obstacles to health \u2013 that is to say, the elimination of <a href=\"/wiki/Malnutrition\" title=\"Malnutrition\">malnutrition</a>, ignorance, contaminated <a href=\"/wiki/Drinking_water\" title=\"Drinking water\">drinking water</a> and unhygienic housing \u2013 quite as much as it does the solution of purely medical problems such as a lack of doctors, hospital beds, drugs and  <a href=\"/wiki/Vaccines\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Vaccines\">vaccines</a>.\n</p><ul><li>Health For All means that health should be regarded as an objective of <a href=\"/wiki/Economic_development\" title=\"Economic development\">economic development</a> and not merely as one of the means of attaining it.</li>\n<li>Health For All demands, ultimately, <a href=\"/wiki/Literacy\" title=\"Literacy\">literacy</a> for all. Until this becomes reality it demands at least the beginning of an understanding of what health means for every individual.</li>\n<li>Health For All depends on continued progress in medical care and <a href=\"/wiki/Public_health\" title=\"Public health\">public health</a>. The health services must be accessible to all through <a href=\"/wiki/Primary_health_care\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Primary health care\">primary health care</a>, in which basic medical help is available in every village, backed up by referral services to more specialised care. <a href=\"/wiki/Immunisation\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Immunisation\">Immunisation</a> must similarly achieve universal coverage.</li>\n<li>Health For All is thus a holistic concept calling for efforts in <a href=\"/wiki/Agriculture\" title=\"Agriculture\">agriculture</a>, industry, education, housing, and <a href=\"/wiki/Communications\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Communications\">communications</a>, just as much as in medicine and public health. Medical care alone cannot bring health to in hovels. Health for such people requires a whole new way of life and fresh opportunities to provide themselves with a higher standard of living.</li></ul>\n<p>The adoption of Health For All by government, implies a commitment to promote the advancement of all citizens on a broad front of development and a resolution to encourage the individual citizen to achieve a higher quality of life.\n</p><p>The rate of progress will depend on the political will. The <a href=\"/wiki/World_Health_Assembly\" title=\"World Health Assembly\">World Health Assembly</a> believes that, given a high degree of determination, Health For All could be attained by the year 2000. That target date is a challenge to all WHO's Member States.\n</p><p>\nThe basis of the Health For All strategy is primary health care.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Two decades later, WHO Director General <a href=\"/wiki/Lee_Jong-wook\" title=\"Lee Jong-wook\">Lee Jong-wook</a> (2003\u20132006) reaffirmed the concept in the <i><a href=\"/wiki/World_Health_Report\" title=\"World Health Report\">World Health Report</a> 2003</i>:<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>Health for all became the slogan for a movement. It was not just an ideal but an organizing principle: everybody needs and is entitled to the highest possible standard of health. The principles remain indispensable for a coherent vision of <a href=\"/wiki/Global_health\" title=\"Global health\">global health</a>. Turning that vision into reality calls for clarity both on the possibilities and on the obstacles that have slowed and in some cases reversed progress towards meeting the health needs of all people. We have a real opportunity now to make progress that will mean longer, healthier lives for millions of people, turn despair into realistic hope, and lay the foundations for improved health for generations to come.</p></blockquote>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Health_For_All&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Health_21\" title=\"Health 21\">Health 21</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Healthy_city\" title=\"Healthy city\">Healthy city</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Millennium_Development_Goals\" title=\"Millennium Development Goals\">Millennium Development Goals</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Health_For_All&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Mahler, Halfdan (1981) \"The meaning of Health For All by the year 2000\", World Health Forum, Vol. 2, No. 1</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-2\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">World Health Organization. <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.who.int/whr/2003/en/overview_en.pdf\"><i>Overview of the World Health Report 2003: Shaping the future</i></a> Geneva, 2003</span>\n</li>\n</ol></div></div>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw2235\nCached time: 20180914122427\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.036 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.049 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 116/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 326/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 78/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 7/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 818/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\nLua time usage: 0.005/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 525 KB/50 MB\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   30.335      1 Template:Reflist\n100.00%   30.335      1 -total\n 10.02%    3.040      1 Template:Main_other\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:27750546-0!canonical and timestamp 20180914122427 and revision id 760692813\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[{"lang":"ar","url":"https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D8%AD%D8%A9_%D9%84%D9%84%D8%AC%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%B9","langname":"Arabic","autonym":"\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629","*":"\u0627\u0644\u0635\u062d\u0629 \u0644\u0644\u062c\u0645\u064a\u0639"}],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","*":"Public_health"},{"sortkey":"","*":"World_Health_Organization"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Agriculture"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Communications"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Drinking water"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Economic development"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Global health"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Halfdan Mahler"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Health 21"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Health promotion"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Healthy city"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Immunisation"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Lee Jong-wook"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Literacy"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Malnutrition"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Millennium Development Goals"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Primary health care"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Public health"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Vaccines"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"World Health Assembly"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"World Health Organization"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"World Health Report"}],"templates":[{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Reflist"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Main other"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Check for unknown parameters"}],"images":[],"externallinks":["http://www.who.int/whr/2003/en/overview_en.pdf"],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Definition","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Health_For_All","byteoffset":379,"anchor":"Definition"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"See also","number":"2","index":"2","fromtitle":"Health_For_All","byteoffset":3870,"anchor":"See_also"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"References","number":"3","index":"3","fromtitle":"Health_For_All","byteoffset":3956,"anchor":"References"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Health For All","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q17041748"}]}}
