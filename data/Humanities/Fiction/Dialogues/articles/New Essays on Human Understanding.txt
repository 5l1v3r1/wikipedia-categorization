New Essays on Human Understanding (French: Nouveaux essais sur l'entendement humain) is a chapter-by-chapter rebuttal by Gottfried Leibniz of John Locke's major work, An Essay Concerning Human Understanding. It is one of only two full-length works by Leibniz (the other being the Theodicy). It was finished in 1704 but Locke's death  was the cause alleged by Leibniz to withhold its publication. The book appeared some sixty years later.  Like many philosophical works of the time, it is written in dialogue form. The two seakers in the book are Theophilus ("loving God" in Greek),  who represents the views of Leibniz, and Philalethes ("loving truth" in Greek),  who represents those of Locke. The famous rebuttal to the empiricist thesis about the provenance of ideas  appears at the beginning of Book II: "Nothing is in the mind without being first in the senses, except for the mind itself".  All of Locke's major arguments against innate ideas are criticized at length by Leibniz, who defends an extreme view of innate cognition, according to which all thoughts and actions of the soul are innate.  In addition to his discussion of innate ideas, Leibniz offers penetrating critiques of Locke's views on personal identity, free will, mind-body dualism, language, necessary truth, and Locke's attempted proof of the existence of God.
