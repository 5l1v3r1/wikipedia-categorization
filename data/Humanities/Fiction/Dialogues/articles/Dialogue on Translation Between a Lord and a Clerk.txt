The Dialogue on Translation between a Lord and a Clerk forms the preface of John Trevisa's 1387 translation of the Polychronicon of Ranulf Higden, made for his patron, Lord Berkeley. Written in Middle English, it consists of a series of arguments made by the clerk (representing Trevisa) on why books should not be translated from learned languages such as Latin, each one followed by a rebuttal from the Lord (representing Lord Berkeley). The clerk eventually agrees and the dialogue concludes with a prayer for guidance in the translation.
