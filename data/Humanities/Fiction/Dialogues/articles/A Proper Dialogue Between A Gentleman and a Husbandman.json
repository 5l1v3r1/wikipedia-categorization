{"parse":{"title":"A Proper Dialogue Between A Gentleman and a Husbandman","pageid":3394874,"revid":799350681,"text":{"*":"<div class=\"mw-parser-output\"><p><i><b>A proper dyaloge betwene a Gentilman and a Husbandman eche complaynynge to other their miserable calamite through the ambicion of the clergye</b></i> was printed in two versions by \"<a href=\"/wiki/Hans_Luft\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hans Luft\">Hans Luft</a>\" (i.e., <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Johannes_Hoochstraten&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Johannes Hoochstraten (page does not exist)\">Johannes Hoochstraten</a>) of <a href=\"/wiki/Antwerp\" title=\"Antwerp\">Antwerp</a> in 1529. This book appears in Robert Steele's list of books banned in Henry's reign; Steele refers to it as \"Dialogue between gentleman &amp; plowman.\" While clearly in the <a href=\"/wiki/Piers_Plowman_Tradition\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Piers Plowman Tradition\">Piers Plowman Tradition</a>, Piers does not appear as a character. The first version has a 684 line acrostic poem opening and dialogue that was written in the sixteenth-century invention. Following this, there is an authentic, late fourteenth-century <a href=\"/wiki/Lollard\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Lollard\">Lollard</a> anti-clerical text, written ca. 1375-85. (It is included in Matthew, ed. <i>The English Works of Wyclif</i>.) To all this, the second version adds another prose tract probably from the late fifteenth century, which argues in favor of vernacular Bible translations. \n</p><p>The dialogue begins with the gentleman lamenting how his class has fallen low and is unable to help the poor, because long ago they were fooled into giving their lands and wealth to the church. The husbandman then argues for confiscating the possessions of a corrupt clergy which preys upon the poor. Belief in <a href=\"/wiki/Purgatory\" title=\"Purgatory\">purgatory</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Indulgences\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Indulgences\">indulgences</a> is singled out as the favorite swindle of the clergy, who are ultimately to blame for rising rents. The husbandman suggests taking the issue to parliament (the 1529 \"Reformation Parliament\"), but the gentleman demurs, alluding to <a href=\"/wiki/Simon_Fish\" title=\"Simon Fish\">Simon Fish</a>'s <i><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=A_Supplicacyon_for_the_Beggers&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"A Supplicacyon for the Beggers (page does not exist)\">A Supplicacyon for the Beggers</a></i> and <a href=\"/wiki/Thomas_More\" title=\"Thomas More\">Thomas More</a>'s rebuttal and defense of purgatory in <i><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=The_Supplycacyon_of_Soulys&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"The Supplycacyon of Soulys (page does not exist)\">The Supplycacyon of Soulys</a></i> (1529). <a href=\"/wiki/John_I_of_England\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"John I of England\">King John</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Sir_John_Oldcastle\" title=\"Sir John Oldcastle\">Sir John Oldcastle</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Humphrey,_Duke_of_Gloucester\" title=\"Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester\">Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester</a> are listed as good men who came to bad ends for opposing the clergy. Then there is an allusion to the burning of <a href=\"/wiki/William_Tyndale\" title=\"William Tyndale\">William Tyndale</a>'s <a href=\"/wiki/New_Testament\" title=\"New Testament\">New Testament</a> in 1526 and <a href=\"/wiki/Henry_V_of_England\" title=\"Henry V of England\">Henry V</a>'s persecution of Lollards. To defend <a href=\"/wiki/Lutherans\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Lutherans\">Lutherans</a> and opposition to clerical possessions from charges of \"newfangledness,\" the husbandman introduces what he takes to be a century-old treatise; i.e., a late-fourteenth-century Lollard text that supports disendowment of the clergy and barring them from secular offices. (The husbandman places it in the time of Richard II.)\n</p>\n<pre>   Now I promyse the after my iudgement\n   I haue not hard of soche an olde fragment\n   Better groundyd on reason with Scripture.\n   Yf soche auncyent thynges myght come to lyght\n   That noble men hadde ones of theym a syght\n   The world yet wolde chaunge perauenture\n   For here agaynst the clergye cannot bercke\n   Sayenge as they do thys is a newe wercke\n   Of heretykes contryued lately.\n   And by thys treatyse it apperyth playne\n   That before oure dayes men did compleyne\n   Agaynst clerkes ambycyon so stately.\n</pre>\n<p>The \"I\" of the husbandman at this point leads into the \"I\" of the Lollard treatise which is attached at the end with little done to make a transition; it is revised to function as contemporary anti-Roman polemic. \n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=A_Proper_Dialogue_Between_A_Gentleman_and_a_Husbandman&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Dissolution_of_the_Monasteries\" title=\"Dissolution of the Monasteries\">Dissolution of the Monasteries</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Piers_Plowman_Tradition\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Piers Plowman Tradition\">Piers Plowman Tradition</a></li></ul>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw2273\nCached time: 20180922025911\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.028 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.040 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 27/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 0/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\nLua time usage: 0.009/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 592 KB/50 MB\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   24.718      1 Template:Italic_title\n100.00%   24.718      1 -total\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:3394874-0!canonical and timestamp 20180922025911 and revision id 799350681\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"Proper Dialogue Between a Gentleman and a Husbandman","*":"1529_books"},{"sortkey":"Proper Dialogue Between a Gentleman and a Husbandman","*":"Medieval_literature"},{"sortkey":"Proper Dialogue Between a Gentleman and a Husbandman","*":"English_literature"},{"sortkey":"Proper Dialogue Between a Gentleman and a Husbandman","*":"English_Reformation"},{"sortkey":"Proper Dialogue Between a Gentleman and a Husbandman","*":"Dialogues"},{"sortkey":"Proper Dialogue Between a Gentleman and a Husbandman","*":"History_of_Catholicism_in_England"},{"sortkey":"Proper Dialogue Between a Gentleman and a Husbandman","*":"Lollards"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Antwerp"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Dissolution of the Monasteries"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Hans Luft"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Henry V of England"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Indulgences"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"John I of England"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Lollard"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Lutherans"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"New Testament"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Piers Plowman Tradition"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Purgatory"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Simon Fish"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Sir John Oldcastle"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Thomas More"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"William Tyndale"},{"ns":0,"*":"Johannes Hoochstraten"},{"ns":0,"*":"A Supplicacyon for the Beggers"},{"ns":0,"*":"The Supplycacyon of Soulys"}],"templates":[{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Italic title"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Italic title"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:No globals"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Yesno"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Arguments"}],"images":[],"externallinks":[],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"See also","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"A_Proper_Dialogue_Between_A_Gentleman_and_a_Husbandman","byteoffset":3105,"anchor":"See_also"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"<i>A Proper Dialogue Between A Gentleman and a Husbandman</i>","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"displaytitle","*":"<i>A Proper Dialogue Between A Gentleman and a Husbandman</i>"},{"name":"defaultsort","*":"Proper Dialogue Between a Gentleman and a Husbandman"},{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q4659058"}]}}
