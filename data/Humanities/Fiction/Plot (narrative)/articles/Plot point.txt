For the role-playing games concept see Plot point (role-playing games) In television and film, a plot point is a significant event within a plot that spins the action around in another direction.  Noted screenwriting teacher Syd Field discusses plot points in his paradigm, popularized in his book Screenplay: The Foundations of Screenwriting.  There he proposes that a well-structured movie has two plot points within a three-act structure.  The first plot point occurs 20 to 30 minutes into the film (assuming a standard 120-minute running time), and the second one occurs 80 to 90 minutes into the film. The first plot point ends Act I and propels the story into Act II; likewise, the second plot point ends Act II and propels the story into Act III.
