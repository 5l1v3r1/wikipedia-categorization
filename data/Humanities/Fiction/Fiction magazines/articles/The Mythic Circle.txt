The Mythic Circle is an illustrated fiction magazine published annually by the Mythopoeic Society containing short fiction and poetry. Founded in 1987 by Sherwood Smith and Lynn Maudlin, The Mythic Circle started as a quarterly zine designed to function as a writers' workshop in print and featured a very active letters column.  After several years the enthusiastic submissions of aspiring writers and the challenge of publishing on a quarterly schedule took their toll and the zine changed to thrice-annually, then twice-annually, and finally became an annual publication.  After Sherwood Smith and Lynn Maudlin retired as co-editors, Tina Cooper served as editor for several years with Lynn Maudlin continuing as production editor. The current editor is Gwenyth Hood; submissions information is available via the Mythopoeic Society website.
