Atomic bomb literature (原爆文学, Genbaku bungaku) is a literary genre in Japanese literature used to describe writing about the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This can include diaries, testimonial or documentary accounts, poetry, drama or fictional works about the bombings and their aftermath. There are several generations of atomic bomb writers. The first, made up of actual survivors of the bombings, who wrote of their own experiences, includes Yōko Ōta, Tamiki Hara, Shinoe Shoda, and Sadako Kurihara. The second, who wrote about the bomb in order to invoke the wider social and political issues it raises, includes Yoshie Hotta, Momo Iida, Kenzaburō Ōe, Masuji Ibuse, Ineko Sata. The third, whose writing looks to the future in a post-nuclear world, includes Kōbō Abe, Makoto Oda, and Mitsuharu Inoue.  Perhaps the best known work of atomic bomb literature is Black Rain by Masuji Ibuse.  Works by non-Japanese authors that could also be deemed[by whom?] as atomic bomb literature include John Hersey's Hiroshima.
