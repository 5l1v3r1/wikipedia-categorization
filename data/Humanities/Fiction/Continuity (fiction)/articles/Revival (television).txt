In television, a revival is a television series that returns to produce new episodes after being off the air for a certain amount of time, particularly due to cancellation.  Network executives may decide to attempt to revive a television program when they feel that a market once again exists for it. It is one of several programming strategies television networks employ to capitalize further on successful programs; among the other methods are spin-offs, reboots, remakes, cast reunions, and television movies. Unlike spin-offs, in which a television network creates an entirely new series around an existing character, a revival reintroduces most or many of the original program's storylines, characters, and locales. Revivals usually take place at some point after the original series ends. By contrast, reboots and remakes may feature many of the original characters, but are usually played by new cast members and without taking into account events or continuity that occurred during the original series.  Legend: "â€”" = denotes shared name with original work.
