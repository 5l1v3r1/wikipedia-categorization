John Truby (born 1952) is a screenwriter, director and screenwriting teacher.  He has served as a consultant on over 1,000 film scripts over the past three decades, and is also known for the screenwriting software program Blockbuster (originally "Storyline Pro"). Truby argues that most teachers of screenwriting emphasize inner transformation of the characters but not the moral effect their actions have on others. He is critical of Syd Field's three-act “Paradigm” and has instead crafted his own 22-step outline. Truby's first book The Anatomy of Story: 22 Steps to Becoming a Master Storyteller was published in October, 2007 by Faber and Faber.  In the 1980s, Truby received his first credits, writing three episodes of 21 Jump Street. He later received a co-writer credit on the 2011 Disney/BBC film African Cats.
