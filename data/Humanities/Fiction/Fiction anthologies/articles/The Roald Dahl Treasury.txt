The Roald Dahl Treasury is an anthology of works of the children's author Roald Dahl. It was first published in the United Kingdom in 1997 by Puffin Books. Included amongst excerpts from all of Dahl's children's books and some previously unpublished material, are unexpurgated colour reprints of The Enormous Crocodile, The Giraffe and the Pelly and Me, Esio Trot and The Minpins. The book includes a large volume of illustrations by Quentin Blake, with some specially commissioned for the project and some appearing for the first time in colour. A selection of guest illustrators including Raymond Briggs and Ralph Steadman add visual variety to the extracts. The book also includes an excerpt from an interview given by Dahl and many letters exchanged between Dahl and family members, including Ophelia Dahl.
