Ramkinar Baij is a book by R. Siva Kumar  that was brought out on the occasion of a massive retrospective exhibition of Ram Kinker Baij at the National Gallery of Modern Art. The exhibition was curated by K.S. Radhakrishnan  and the book was brought out in collaboration with the Delhi Art Gallery. The book presents entire body of Ramkinkar’s sketches, watercolours, etchings, oils and sculptures, together with many invaluable period photographs. This is considered to be the authoritative volume on the “prolific master”.  Drawing distinction between Benode Behari Mukherjee and Ram Kinker Baij Siva Kumar notes, "If his friend and colleague Binodebihari painted the starker side of Santiniketan landscape, and saw himself as a lonely palm tree in the middle of the barren and parched Khoai, Ramkinkar saw himself as the Palash in full bloom: No leaves, bare branches, fully ablaze".  In 2013 R. Siva Kumar was awarded by the Paschimbanga Bangla Akademi for this book.
