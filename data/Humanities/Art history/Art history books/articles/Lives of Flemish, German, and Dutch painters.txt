The Lives of Flemish, German, and Dutch painters refers to a compilation of artist biographies by Jean-Baptiste Descamps published in the mid 18th-century that were accompanied by illustrations by Charles Eisen. The list of illustrations follows and is in page order by volume. Most of the biographies were translated into French from earlier work by Karel van Mander and Arnold Houbraken. The illustrated portraits were mostly based on engravings by Jan Meyssens for Het Gulden Cabinet and by Arnold and Jacobus Houbraken for their Schouburgh, while the work examples engraved in the margins of the portraits were mostly based on engravings by Jacob Campo Weyerman.
