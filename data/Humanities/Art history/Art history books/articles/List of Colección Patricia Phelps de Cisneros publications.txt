List of Colecci贸n Patricia Phelps de Cisneros publications is a collection of exhibition catalogs, scholarly works, and ebooks focused on Latin American art published by Colecci贸n Patricia Phelps de Cisneros (CPPC), a privately held Latin American art collection organization founded by Patricia Phelps de Cisneros and Gustavo Cisneros based in Venezuela and New York City. Since the 1990s, the Colecci贸n Patricia Phelps de Cisneros was created with a goal of bringing visibility and impact to the way Latin American art history is viewed and appreciated both on a regional and international level. As part of its four-pronged approach, CPPC lends artworks often in traveling exhibitions held at major institutional partners with accompanying exhibition catalogs that include essays, manifestos, and bibliographic profiles.  CPPC works with scholars and academics to learn more about the artists and their works, and has established a prolific publications program to provide supporting information about the artists and their work, in addition to building an online forum for the artwork.  The publication program of Colecci贸n Patricia Phelps de Cisneros that is represented here is unique in its international and pan-regional scope. Works are typically published in multiple languages, often within the same publication. The publications are oftentimes the first time the collection and curation of information about certain artists and regional and national art movements are published. Contributors are established art historians, curators, and often the artists who are working within or are part of the art movements themselves. Art movement manifestos are published in their entirety, often with full translations, in accessible and/or digital format, sometimes for the first time.   CPPC has published over 60 publications and has released e-books as part of its Conversaciones series, which are also made available in e-book format.   In chronological order
