The full title of the book is <i><b>Stealing the Mystic Lamb: The True Story of the World\u2019s Most Coveted Masterpiece</b></i>.  The book was published in 2010 by PublicAffairs.  It tells the story of The <i><a href=\"/wiki/Ghent_Altarpiece\" title=\"Ghent Altarpiece\">Ghent Altarpiece</a></i> (also known as <i>The Adoration of the Mystic Lamb,</i> or simply <i>The Mystic Lamb</i>), a monumental oil painting by the Flemish master <a href=\"/wiki/Jan_van_Eyck\" title=\"Jan van Eyck\">Jan van Eyck</a>, currently on display in the cathedral of <a href=\"/wiki/Saint_Bavo\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Saint Bavo\">Saint Bavo</a>, in the city of <a href=\"/wiki/Ghent\" title=\"Ghent\">Ghent</a>.  The work is arguably the most influential painting in history, and it is also the most frequently stolen artwork of all-time.  Charney\u2019s book tells the story of the artwork and the many crimes and mysteries of which it was the victim since its completion in 1432.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Critical_Reaction\">Critical Reaction</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Stealing_the_Mystic_Lamb&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Critical Reaction\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Charney\u2019s book received much critical praise, including the following review from <a href=\"/wiki/Kirkus_Reviews\" title=\"Kirkus Reviews\">Kirkus Reviews</a> (15 July 2010):\n</p><p>\"Charney (Art History/American Univ. of Rome; The Art Thief, 2007, etc.) unsnarls the tangled history of Jan van Eyck\u2019s 15th-century <i>The Ghent Altarpiece (aka The Mystic Lamb)</i>, \u201cthe most desired and victimized object of all time.\u201d\nWith a novelist\u2019s sense of structure and tension, the author adds an easy familiarity with the techniques of oil painting and with the intertwining vines of art and political and religious history. He begins near the end of World War II. As the Reich\u2019s military fortunes crumbled, the Allies scrambled to find where the Nazis concealed their tens of thousands of stolen artworks, many slated for Hitler\u2019s proposed \u201csuper museum.\u201d Among them was the Altarpiece. Charney pauses to describe the large work, which comprises 20 individual painted panels, hinged together. Art historians admire it not just for its supreme craftsmanship\u2014described clearly by the author\u2014but also for its historical significance as the world\u2019s first major oil painting. Charney also lists a number of \u201cfirsts\u201d that the work represents (e.g., the first to use directed spotlighting) and sketches the biography of van Eyck, which makes Shakespeare\u2019s seem richly detailed by comparison. Commissioned to create the altarpiece for the Saint Bavo Cathedral in Ghent, Belgium, van Eyck took some six years to complete it. As religious and political strife waxed and waned, the painting was always in danger. The Calvinists didn\u2019t like it (the Catholics promptly hid it); Napoleon, perhaps history\u2019s greatest art thief, craved it; a cathedral fire threatened it; the Germans came for it in World War I and again in World War II. Even now, one panel remains at large, though some argue that the replacement copy is actually the original.\nA brisk tale of true-life heroism, villainy, artistry and passion.\"\n</p><p><b>The Author</b>\n</p><p>Noah Charney holds advanced degrees in art history from <a href=\"/wiki/The_Courtauld_Institute\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Courtauld Institute\">The Courtauld Institute</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Cambridge_University\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cambridge University\">Cambridge University</a>.
