Apollo is an English-language monthly magazine covering visual arts of all periods, from antiquity to the present day.   Founded in 1925 and based in London, Apollo features a mixture of reviews, art-world news and scholarly articles.  Described as "The International Magazine for Collectors", Apollo is owned by the Barclay brothers through the Press Holdings Media Group company. The magazine rewards excellence in arts through an annual Apollo Magazine Awards.  In line with its reputation as a magazine for collectors, Apollo regularly reports on museum acquisitions and international art fairs, including The European Fine Art Fair (TEFAF) in Maastricht, Netherlands and Frieze Art Fair in London's Regent's Park, as well as publishing  profiles on eminent collectors, such as Eli Broad, the Duke of Devonshire, Anita Zabludowich, Robert H. Smith, Sheihka Hussah al-Sabah and Charles Ryskamp. Along with regular news and reviews, Apollo has published  interviews with contemporary artists including Howard Hodgkin,  Mark Quinn,  Antony Gormley and architect Norman Foster. Its end-of-year awards includes a "Personality of the Year"; in 2011 the winner was Sir Mark Jones, former Director of the Victoria and Albert Museum.  Recent collaborative editions have included special issues in partnership with the J. Paul Getty Museum and the Yale Center for British Art. The current editor is Thomas Marks and regular contributors include Martin Gayford, Alan Powers, Emma Crichton-Miller, Simon Grant, Vincent Katz and art-market correspondent Susan Moore.
