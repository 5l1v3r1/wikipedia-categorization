Discovered in February 1974 by Mr. A.

Most synagogues, aside from others which were located in the same northern Galil region, did not share this feature.

While the synagogue did not originally have a narthex, one was added during the later phases of building to the north, although it was totally destroyed. The later phases also added an additional entrance to the north, presumably to allow for easier access to the sanctuary.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Apse\">Apse</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Maoz_Haim_Synagogue&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Apse\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The apse, where the Torah Shrine had previously stood in the first phase of the synagogue, was further modified in the 6th century to include a raised platform enclosed by a <a href=\"/wiki/Chancel_screen\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Chancel screen\">chancel screen</a> which may have been used to emphasize the sanctity of the Torah shrine area as compared to the rest of the synagogue or the congregation.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> Such separations were very common in ancient synagogues and the raised <a href=\"/wiki/Bima\" title=\"Bima\">bima</a> area is what shows that this was no exception.<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> The area of the screen depicted a menorah as well as <a href=\"/wiki/Hebrew\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hebrew\">Hebrew</a> letters.

The coins themselves were from the Byzantine era and helped identify the stages of building and development. More coins, fifty in all, were found outside the southern wall which were most likely hidden there amongst broken roof tiles in order to serve as a possible emergency funds, although the original owner never had the chance to claim them.<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Mosaic_Floor\">Mosaic Floor</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Maoz_Haim_Synagogue&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Mosaic Floor\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>There were many interesting <a href=\"/wiki/Mosaic\" title=\"Mosaic\">mosaics</a> which were found at the dig site.

Geometric patterns were popular before as in the earliest layer to an extent, but likely were especially valued in an aniconic society.
