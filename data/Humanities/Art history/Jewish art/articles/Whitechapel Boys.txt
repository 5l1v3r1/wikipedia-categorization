  The name "Whitechapel Boys" identifies a loosely-knit group of Anglo-Jewish writers and artists of the early 20th century.  It is named after Whitechapel, which contained one of London's main Jewish settlements and from which many of its members came.  These members included Mark Gertler, Isaac Rosenberg, David Bomberg, Joseph Leftwich, Jacob Kramer, Morris Goldstein, Stephen Winsten, John Rodker, Lazarus Aaronson and its only female member, Clara Birnberg.   The name is modern, not a contemporary one, originating later in the 20th century.  Several of the Whitechapel Boys, such as Rodker, Rosenberg, Leftwich, Winsten and Bomberg, were also politically active and members of the radical Young Socialist League.
