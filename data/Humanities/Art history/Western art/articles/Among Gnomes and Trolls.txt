Among Gnomes and Trolls (Swedish: Bland tomtar och troll), is a popular Swedish folklore and fairy tales annual and children's fairy tale anthology published since 1907. One of the most noted of the early illustrators is artist John Bauer. Founded in 1907,  and continuing to this very day,  several of the foremost Swedish authors and illustrators have worked for the annual. The first volumes had illustrations by John Bauer who was succeeded by Gustaf Tenggren. Between 1927 and 1980, Einar Norelius was the chief illustrator. Among the writers were authors such as Hjalmar Bergman, Helena Nyblom, Margareta Ekström, Gösta Knutsson and Edith Unnerstad.  Several books with extracts from the original volumes illustrated by John Bauer have been published. The first one was published in 1931 to raise money for a memorial honouring Bauer.  One of the most noted pictures from "Among gnomes and trolls" by John Bauer 1913 is Ännu sitter Tuvstarr kvar och ser ner i vattnet ("Still, Tuvstarr sits and gazes down into the water").
