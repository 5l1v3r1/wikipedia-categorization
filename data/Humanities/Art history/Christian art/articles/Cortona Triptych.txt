The Cortona Triptych is a Catholic Church depiction of the Madonna and Child with saints, painted by Fra Angelico. It is now kept at the Diocesan Museum in Cortona, Italy. The painting dates from 1436-1437.  The triptych was originally painted for the church of San Domenico in Cortona, and belonged to the Order of Saint Dominic. It was painted in Fiesole, and then shipped to Cortona, probably just before Fra Angelico painted the Perugia Altarpiece in 1437, with which this work shares many common elements.  The predella depicts the story of Saint Dominic along with other saints:    The predella of the triptych
