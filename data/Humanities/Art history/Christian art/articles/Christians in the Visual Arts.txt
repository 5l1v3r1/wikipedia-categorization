 Christians in the Visual Arts (CIVA) is an American visual arts organization working to enhance and explore the relationship between Christian faith and the visual arts.   It was founded in 1979.  Gallery instructor Jeremy Hamilton-Arnold describes CIVA's work as "Many of the artists involved [in CIVA] are making art worth showing, sharing, and talking about."  It publishes the Seen magazine,  and co-curates and co-sponsors traveling art exhibitions.
