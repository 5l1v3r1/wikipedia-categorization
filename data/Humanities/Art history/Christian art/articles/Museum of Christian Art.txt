It is a project of the Archdiocese of Goa and was set up with technical and financial assistance from the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, Portugal and the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH), New Delhi. Earlier, it was located at the Seminary of Rachol, Salcete, Goa. Its exhibits are divided into the following categories: The Lonely Planet says: "Within the Convent of St. Monica, the excellent Museum of Christian Art contains statuary, paintings and sculptures transferred here from the Rachol Seminary. Many of the works of Goan Christian art during the Portuguese era were produced by local Hindu artists."  Fodors, another travel guide, notes  that the museum is located inside the Convent of St. Monica, and "has a number of objects of Christian interest, including paintings and religious silverware, some dating back to the 16th century." It also notes that this convent was the first nunnery of its kind in the East and continued until the late 19th century. In Goa, the Goa State Museum also houses a Christian Art Gallery. In August 2011, Mumbai also announced plans to open its museum of Christian art.  In January 2012, a major art heist was reported  at the museum.
