A weighted catenary is a catenary curve, but of a special form. A "regular" catenary has the equation for a given value of a. A weighted catenary has the equation and now two constants enter: a and b. A catenary arch has a uniform thickness. However, if it becomes more complex. A weighted catenary is needed. Note that "aspect ratio" is important, which see,   The Gateway Arch in the American city of St. Louis (Missouri) is the most famous example of a weighted catenary. Simple suspension bridges use weighted catenaries.  Category:Catenary Category:Arches
