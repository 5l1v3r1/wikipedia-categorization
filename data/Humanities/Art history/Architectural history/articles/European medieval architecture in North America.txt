Medieval architecture in North America is an anachronism. Some structures in North America can however be classified as medieval, either by age or origin. In some rare cases these structures are seen as evidence on pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact. Although much of this is pseudoscience, these buildings are of interest to American scholars of medieval architecture. Medieval building that have been transported to North America in modern times. Other later period buildings were also transported like the Cotswold Cottage, built in the early 17th century in Chedworth, Gloucestershire, England, now in The Henry Ford museum in Dearborn, Michigan. The Church of St. Mary the Virgin, Aldermanbury, London, which was designed by Sir Christopher Wren in 1677 is now in Fulton, Missouri. It includes a spiral staircase which probably dates to the 15th century.
