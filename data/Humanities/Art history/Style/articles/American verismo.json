{"parse":{"title":"American verismo","pageid":54383792,"revid":847901519,"text":{"*":"<div class=\"mw-parser-output\"><p><b>American verismo</b> describes an artistic style of American literature, music, or painting influenced and inspired by artistic ideas that began in 19th-century Italian culture, movements that used motifs from everyday life and working class persons from both urban and rural situations.  American composers, writers, painters, and poets have used this genre to create works that contain socio-political as well as purely aesthetic statements.\n</p><p>In Italy, the term \u201cverismo\u201d is applied to the use of everyday life and characters in artistic works.  It was introduced into opera in the early 1900s in reaction to contemporary conventions that were regarded as artificial and untruthful.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Generally, \u201cverismo\u201d (meaning \"realism,\" from Italian <i>vero</i>, meaning \"true\") refers to a 19th-century Italian painting style.  This style was practiced most characteristically by the \"I Macchiaioli\" a group of Tuscan painters, who were forerunners of the French Impressionists.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources.

Verga, L. Capuana, D. Ciampoli, R. Fucini, M. Serao introduced the language of common people into their works and made extensive use of dialects.  The Italians also created a theater that reflected everyday life, as exemplified by the comedies of G. Rovetta and G. Giacosa.\n</p><p>In America, Tobias Picker\u2019s 2013 opera that opened at the San Francisco Opera was acclaimed as a \u201ctriumph of American verismo.\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Verismo opera composers often chose rural folk, poor city dwellers, and representatives of bohemianism.  Early works in this genre were P. Mascagni\u2019s <a href=\"/wiki/Cavalleria_Rusticana\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cavalleria Rusticana\">Cavalleria Rusticana</a>( 1890) which chose rural folk, poor city dwellers, and bohemian characters.\n</p><p>The American painter Jerry Ross calls his style \u201cAmerican verismo.\u201d  Jerry Ross has been teaching a series of workshops and classes in Eugene, Oregon based on his study of the I Macchiaioli.  He founded the group \u201cClub Macchia,\u201d a group of like-minded plein air painters working in Oregon and Washington.  The group had two important exhibitions in Oregon at the Newport Art Center in Newport and the Jacobs Gallery in Eugene.  The exhibition at the Jacobs Gallery in Eugene saw the distribution of their book about the group and was well attended.  This was one of the last exhibitions held at the Gallery before it went out of business in 2015.\n</p><p>In his classes, Ross teaches the concept of Macchia as \u201cspot or stain or dab\u201d and distinguishes between mass, line, color, and edge macchie (the plural of macchia).  Explaining the Francophile bias of American expressionism, Ross builds on the ideas of art historian Albert Boime and his book <i>The Art of the Macchia and the Risorgimento, Representing Culture and Nationalism in Nineteenth-Century Italy</i>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>This text had a huge effect on Ross who began incorporating the story of the I Macchialioli into his class materials.  Ross\u2019s own background in the radical politics of the 1960s and 1970s led to his identification with the Tuscan group, many of whom participated in the struggle for Italian socialism and national unification.  In 2013, Ross wrote a \"Manifesto of American Verismo,\" which summarized many of his ideas on the subject.\n</p><p>Desiring a painting style that was truly Italian and representative of their particular cultural characteristics, loose and expressive and breaking with tradition the I Macchiaioli began artistic movement.  As explained by Boime, their \u201csketch style\u201d and \u201cnon finito\u201d (unfinished) look was both modern and a clean break with academic \u201cpolish,\u201d but also the subject matter was often political as well, featuring socio-political issues such as the plight of women, workers, and farmers.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Ross makes the point that while line, mass, and color are important in every painting, for rapid plein air work one might be better off beginning with thumbnail \u201cscribble\u201d sketches and small two to four values studies using the biggest brush possible for the job.  This \u201cdisegno\u201d (design) becomes the blueprint for the painting and establishes the \u201cmacchia\u201d (in the sense of the harmonious overall distribution of lights and darks).  Without a strong macchia structure the work will lack \u201cimpact\u201d (the term used by the I Macchiaioli artists) for such an imprimatur (underpainting) that becomes the basis for the final work (either through wet into wet or wet into dry approaches).\n</p><p>Ross points out that the most experienced plein air painters generally use this approach, sometimes called \u201ccontemporary impressionism.\u201d  Ross notes that after absorbing some of the ideas in painting brought into the light of day by the Abstract Expressionists, plein air painters need to incorporate abstraction and descriptive/expressive brushwork as well as texture techniques that give the surface a three-dimensional quality.  His class \u201cabstraction in plein air\u201d emphasizes the idea of discovery of large abstract shapes and the importance of composition.  In his approach, \u201cthere is abstraction within realism and realism within abstraction.\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=American_verismo&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https://prezi.com/rb-rxbujv9iw/what-is-verismo/\">https://prezi.com/rb-rxbujv9iw/what-is-verismo/</a></span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-2\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Boime, Albert The Art of the MAcchia and the Risorgimento University of Chicago Press, 1993.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-3\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-3\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http://theclassicalreview.com/2013/09/pickers-dolores-claiborne-a-triumph-for-american-verismo-and-san-francisco-opera/\">http://theclassicalreview.com/2013/09/pickers-dolores-claiborne-a-triumph-for-american-verismo-and-san-francisco-opera/</a>&gt;</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-4\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-4\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Boime, Albert The Art of the MAcchia and the Risorgimento University of Chicago Press, 1993.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-5\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-5\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.eugeneweekly.com/20151231/visual-arts/painting-political\">http://www.eugeneweekly.com/20151231/visual-arts/painting-political</a></span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-6\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-6\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Schulte, Mary Jane (September 25, 2014). \"Adding Poetry to the World\". \"The Eugene Register Guard\". pp. 1\u20132.
