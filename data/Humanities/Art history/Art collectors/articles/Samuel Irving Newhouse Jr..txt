Samuel Irving "S.I." Newhouse Jr. (November 8, 1927 – October 1, 2017) was an American heir to a substantial magazine and media business. Together with his brother Donald, he owned Advance Publications, founded by their late father in 1922, whose properties include Condé Nast (publisher of such magazines as Vogue, Vanity Fair, The New Yorker, etc.), dozens of newspapers across the United States (including The Star-Ledger, The Plain Dealer, The Oregonian, etc.), former cable company Bright House Networks, and a controlling stake in Discovery Communications.  He was the son of Mitzi (née Epstein) and Samuel Irving Newhouse Sr., the founder of Advance Publications. Sam Newhouse Sr. had been the young editor of the Bayonne Times and when he asked the owner of the Times for a raise he had long deserved, he was refused. Sam then quit the Times to become associated with the Staten Island paper that formed the basis of his publication future. Newhouse attended the Horace Mann School in New York City. Prior to his death, he had an estimated net worth of $9.5 billion, and he was ranked the 46th richest American by Forbes magazine in 2014.  Newhouse gave money to charity, including $15 million to Syracuse University. He was also an art collector,  who at one time owned one of the most valuable paintings in the world, a Jackson Pollock drip painting, titled No. 5, 1948.  Newhouse was listed by Art News as among the top 200 art collectors in the world.  He was married to Jane Franke from 1951–59, and they had three children, Sam, Wynn (died 2010), and Pamela.  His parents were deeply disappointed by the divorce.  In 1973, he married Victoria Carrington Benedict de Ramel, who survived him.  His grandson, S.I. Newhouse IV, appeared in the documentary Born Rich.  Newhouse died on October 1, 2017 at the age of 89.
