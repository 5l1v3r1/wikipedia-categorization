Lucas van Uffelen or Uffel (1586 â€“ 1637) was a Dutch merchant and art collector. Uffelen was born in Amsterdam, but moved to Venice where he grew his art collection.  When he returned to Amsterdam in 1630, he continued to collect art. When he died, many of his Italian paintings were purchased by the Reynst Collection. He had his portrait painted by Anthony van Dyck twice, once in 1622 and later in the fashionable "action" style of getting up from one's chair. He appears to be getting up to greet the viewer after studying the objects of his collection. Second portrait by Anthony van Dyck
