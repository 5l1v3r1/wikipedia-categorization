Potnia Theron (Ἡ Πότνια Θηρῶν, "The Mistress of the Animals") is a term first used (once) by Homer (Iliad 21. 470) and often used to describe female divinities associated with animals.  The word Potnia, meaning mistress or lady, was a Mycenaean Greek word inherited by Classical Greek, with the same meaning, cognate to Sanskrit patnī.  Homer's mention of potnia theron is thought to refer to Artemis and Walter Burkert describes this mention as "a well established formula".  An Artemis type deity, a 'Mistress of the Animals', is often assumed to have existed in prehistorical religion and often referred to as Potnia Theron, with some scholars positing a relationship between Artemis and goddesses depicted in Minoan art and "Potnia Theron has become a generic term for any female associated with animals."   Many depictions use a female version of the widespread ancient motif of the male Master of Animals, showing a central figure with a human form grasping two animals, one to each side.  The oldest depiction has been discovered in Çatalhöyük.  Another example of Potnia theròn is situated in Museo civico archeologico di Monte Rinaldo   in Italy: plate illustrates goddess that wears a long dress and holds hands with two panthers.
