Orestes Pursued by the Furies is an event from Greek mythology that is a recurring theme in art depicting Orestes. In the Iliad, the king of Argos, Agamemnon, sacrifices his daughter Iphigenia to the Gods to assure good sailing weather to Troy.  In  Agamemnon, the first play of Aeschylus's Oresteia trilogy, Agamemnon is murdered by his wife, Clytemnestra, and her lover, Aegisthus as revenge for sacrificing Iphigenia. In The Libation Bearers, the second play of the Orestia, Agamemnon's son Orestes returns home to take revenge on his mother for murdering his father.  Orestes ultimately does murder his mother, and afterward is tormented by The Furies, beings who personify the anger of the dead. Orestes being tormented by the Furies has been depicted by a number of artists.
