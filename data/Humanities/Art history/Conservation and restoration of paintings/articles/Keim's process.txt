Keim's process is a technique of fresco preparation and painting intended to maximize the lifetime of the finished work. The process, as reported in 1884 at the Royal Society of Arts in London, was created by chemist and craftsman Adolf Wilhelm Keim of Munich, as an improvement on the earlier stereochromy technique of Schlotthaner and Johann Nepomuk von Fuchs.     Keim's focus on carefully preparing the painting ground came from his study of older frescos and their state of preservation.  Keim reportedly labored for twelve years to refine his process.
