Born June 20, 1929 in Cluj, Romania, she is a Holocaust survivor, art professor, and historian. She is married to mathematician Egon Balas, also a retired professor at Carnegie Mellon.  Balas' main areas of interest are modern art (1890-1960), painting and sculpture, and the art of the Italian Renaissance.

She has been teaching at Carnegie Mellon University since 1977, and is also an Adjunct Professor of History of Art and Architecture at the University of Pittsburgh. Edith Balas is also a Holocaust survivor, having been sent to the Nazi death camp Auschwitz.  In Bird in Flight: Memoir of a Survivor and Scholar,  Balas tells her story of facing grim situations and becoming what she describes as a “professional survivor.”  Balas named her memoir “Bird in Flight” after Constantin Brâncuși’s famous sculpture of the same name. “I consider it emblematic of my life,” she said.  After the war her husband was imprisoned by the communist authorities for three years, during which Balas raised their two daughters. She received an M.A. in Philosophy from the University of Bucharest in 1952.  She then emigrated to the United States with her husband, and received an M.A. in the History of Arts from Pittsburgh University in 1970 and a Ph.D. in 1973.
