 Gregory Buchakjian (born 1971, in Beirut, Lebanon) is a Lebanese photographer, filmmaker and art historian. He studied at the Paris-Sorbonne University. He teaches at Académie Libanaise des Beaux-Arts ALBA and was co founder, with architects Pierre Hage Boutros and Rana Haddad, of Atelier de Recherche ALBA.  Gregory Buchakjian is member of the advisory committee of the Saradar Collection, devoted to Lebanese art from the contemporary and modern periods.  Gregory Buchakjian emerged in the art scene after the 2006 Lebanon War within a collective of Lebanese filmmakers.  He directed What Shoes, a short animation film  presented part of the Videos Under Siege project featured in the Dubai International Film Festival 2008. In the following years, he slipped into Beirut’s vibrant and underground nightlife. His photographs depict sensuality although violence and anxiety remain hidden.  Taking its name "Nighthawks" from a famous painting by Edward Hopper, the project was exhibited in Der Aa-kerk, Groningen as part of the 18th Noorderlicht Photofestival 2011: Metropolis.  From 2009 to 2016, Gregory Buchakjian constituted a long term projet devoted to abandoned dwellings in Beirut, that developed as  photographic interpretation of the derelict interiors  and grew into an extensive research and a PhD dissertation.  In this context, he collaborated with Said Baalbaki on a lithography artist book based on Wadi Abu Jamil, the former Jewish Quarter of Beirut, where Baalbaki grew up, that was witnessed dramatic transformations during the war and postwar periods.     In 2018, Gregory Buchakjian was selected to be part of The Place that remains, the first national Pavilion of Lebanon curated by Hala Younes at the Venice Biennale of Architecture
