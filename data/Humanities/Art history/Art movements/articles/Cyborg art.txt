Cyborg art, also known as cyborgism,  is an art movement that began in the mid-2000s in Britain.  It is based on the creation and addition of new senses to the body via cybernetic implants  and the creation of art works through new senses.  Cyborg artworks are created by cyborg artists;  artists whose senses have been voluntarily enhanced through cybernetic implants.  Among the early artists shaping the cyborg art movement are Neil Harbisson, whose antenna implant allows him to perceive ultraviolet and infrared colours,  and Moon Ribas whose implants in her elbows   allow her to feel earthquakes and moonquakes.  Other cyborg artists include Manel Mu√±oz, a Catalan photographer who developed and installed a barometric system in his ears that allows him to perceive atmospheric pressure changes.
