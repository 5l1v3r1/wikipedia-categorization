This is a descriptive list of art from the Stone Age, the period of prehistory characterised by the widespread use of stone tools. This page contains, by sheer volume of the artwork discovered, a very incomplete list of the works of the painters, sculptors, and other artists who created what we now call prehistoric art. For fuller lists see Art of the Upper Paleolithic, Art of the Middle Paleolithic, and Category:Prehistoric art and its many sub-categories. Prehistoric figurines made from stone, ceramic or other materials have been found around the world. Notable examples included the Venus figurines of Upper Palaeolithic Europe and female anthropomorphic figurines from Neolithic Southwest Asia and Eastern Europe.
