Archive Team is a group dedicated to preserving digital history that was founded by Jason Scott in 2009.   Its primary focus is the copying and preservation of content housed by at-risk services. Some of its projects include the partial preservation of GeoCities,   Yahoo! Video, Google Video, Splinder, Friendster, FortuneCity,         TwitPic,  SoundCloud,  and the "Aaron Swartz Memorial JSTOR Liberator".  Archive Team also archives URL shortener services  and wikis  on a regular basis. According to Jason Scott, "Archive Team was started out of anger and a feeling of powerlessness, this feeling that we were letting companies decide for us what was going to survive and what was going to die."  Scott continues, "it's not our job to figure out what's valuable, to figure out what's meaningful. We work by three virtues: rage, paranoia and kleptomania."
