Object conservation involves the preservation of three-dimensional works of art. This type of conservator is differentiated from other specialists because they treat a broad range of objects and material types. This classification of material includes archaeological, ethnographic, historical, sculpture, decorative arts, and contemporary art. This type of conservator specializes in the preservation of artifacts that are excavated from a burial environment. These environments can be in a terrestrial setting or underwater. Archaeological conservators work closely with archaeologists to identify what the conservation needs of an excavation site are and assist in setting up field laboratories.
