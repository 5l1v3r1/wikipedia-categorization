Workmen were brought from England and Germany to build the cone, a major Glasgow landmark of its day, which reached a height of 120 feet. The company amalgamated with the Glasgow Bottlework Company in c. 1786 and in 1806 the business was sold to the Dumbarton Glass Company. The new business was immediately sold to John Geddes, on the condition that he did not make window glass or bottles.\n</p><p>John Geddes founded the <b>\u2018Glasgow and Verreville Glass and Pottery Company\u2019</b>, which quickly established itself and developed an export trade to North America and Ireland. However, pottery production was a very competitive market and Geddes was soon declared bankrupt. In 1830 the pottery was taken over by Robert Montgomery, a former manager. Montgomery\u2019s involvement with the pottery was short-lived and by 1833 he too was declared bankrupt. The glassworks were closed in 1834.\n</p><p>The glassworks and John Geddes\u2019 house and grounds (Verreville House) were bought by Robert Alexander Kidston who was a partner in the nearby Anderston Pottery (often called Lancefield Pottery). By this time the pottery had two earthenware kilns and one china kiln. Kidston tried to raise the quality of the products - he added the production of porcelain, imported Staffordshire workers and extended the works into the grounds of Verreville House \u2013 but by 1841 he himself was in financial trouble and the firm was taken over by a consortium, one of whom was Robert Cochran, whose family later owned the much larger Britannia Pottery in Glasgow. Glassmaking appears to have ceased production in 1842 and a number of small pottery kilns were built inside the original glassworks cone. Only white and earthenwares were being made by this time. The Cochran family remained in charge of the pottery until its eventual closure in 1918.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Archaeological_Excavations\">Archaeological Excavations</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Verreville_Glass_and_Pottery_Works,_Glasgow&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Archaeological Excavations\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Headland_Archaeology\" title=\"Headland Archaeology\">Headland excavations</a> in 2005 revealed several features related to three major phases of development: glass manufacturing activity (c. 1777 \u2013 mid-1840s), pottery manufacturing phase (late 1840s \u2013 c. 1859) and the later pottery works (after c. 1859 \u2013 c. 1918).\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Glass_Manufacturing_Activity\">Glass Manufacturing Activity</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Verreville_Glass_and_Pottery_Works,_Glasgow&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Glass Manufacturing Activity\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<dl><dt>The Glassworking Cone</dt></dl>\n<p>The earliest phase of activity identified on site was associated with the <a href=\"/wiki/Glass_production\" title=\"Glass production\">production of glass</a>.

A number of rectangular ash pits, evenly spaced along the edges of the main kiln bases, were identified with each kiln. These contained ash and kiln furniture and were used to collect the burnt material falling from the fires above. Surrounding each of the kilns were cobbled floors, which sloped downward to the external edges of the ash pits \u2013 to allow easy emptying of the content of the ash pits.\n</p><p>Three kilns were situated within the probable location of the large circular glass cone, built in c. 1777.  Historical reference note that after the glass cone went out of use (c. 1840) a number of small pottery kilns were built within it, reusing the glass cone building to house them.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Later_Pottery_works\">The Later Pottery works</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Verreville_Glass_and_Pottery_Works,_Glasgow&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: The Later Pottery works\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>During the final 50 years of production existing buildings were adapted to new functions and new technology. <a href=\"/wiki/Steam_power\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Steam power\">Steam power</a> was by now incorporated within the factory.\n</p><p>The archaeological evidence for the final phase of Verreville Pottery factory offers glimpses into the complex operations of <a href=\"/wiki/Pottery\" title=\"Pottery\">pottery</a> manufacturing such as processing, constructing, drying and firing of vessels.

After this the clay would be thrown (wedged) to remove air bubbles and moulded or slip cast before placing into the pot drying room and finally into the kilns for firing.\n</p><p>Archaeological
