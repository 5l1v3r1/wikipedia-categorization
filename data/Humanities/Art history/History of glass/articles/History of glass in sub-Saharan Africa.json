The mineral soda-alumina (abbreviated m-Na-Al or mNa) chemical composition of most Trade Wind Beads found in Sub-Saharan regions suggests a connection to the mineral-soda sources and alumina rich sand ubiquitous in India; however, there is no archaeological evidence to support this hypothesis to date.3 Other analysts propose a Middle Eastern, Venetian and/or Portuguese origin for the Trade Wind beads found in Sub-Saharan regions.<sup id=\"cite_ref-david_2-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-david-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Slave_Beads\">Slave Beads</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=History_of_glass_in_sub-Saharan_Africa&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Slave Beads\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Trade_beads\" title=\"Trade beads\">Trade beads</a></div>\n<p>European nations became increasingly involved in the glass bead trade with Africa which consequently aided in the foreign exploitation of natural resources, including slaves.  Because Westerners viewed Africans as \u201cthe uncivilised of the World,\u201d7 glass beads known crudely as \u201cslave beads\u201d were commonly exchanged for human cargo which could then be shipped and traded for other desired goods.  The residual effects from the glass bead trade had dramatically varying results across Sub-Saharan Africa.  While most regions suffered economic and social hardship due to abusive foreign monopolies, some nations prospered from this interaction.  Coastal ports serving as initial points of contact often benefited from access to imported goods, reaping profits from their own subsequent distribution to regions inland.  Scholars have suggested that the rise of Empires in Ghana and Mali between the 8th-13th centuries, as well as the Kingdoms of Benin and Akan during the 16th century are intrinsically related to the access and distribution of foreign glass beads.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Dubin_1-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Dubin-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>  3 5\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Bead_Manufacture\">Bead Manufacture</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=History_of_glass_in_sub-Saharan_Africa&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Bead Manufacture\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Glass_Manufacture:_Primary_and_Secondary_Glass_Production\">Glass Manufacture: Primary and Secondary Glass Production</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=History_of_glass_in_sub-Saharan_Africa&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: Glass Manufacture: Primary and Secondary Glass Production\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Primary glass production involves the combination of the raw materials Soda, Lime and Silica, heated at specific temperatures in order to produce a basic glass compound (see Glass and Anglo-Saxon Glass).  Traditionally, glass has been made from either the mixture of ground quartz stones (providing the silica) and plant ash (supplying the soda and lime elements); or, by utilizing sand as a silica and lime source and then adding a chemical natron for the remaining soda needed.  The production of primary glass has seen much variation throughout its history, each region slightly altering the chemical composition to better suit its particularly environmental and cultural needs (i.e. adding various fluxes/chemical additives in order to lower the required melting temperature).  The addition of mineral deposits to alter the colour of glass can be carried out in the primary stage or can be added in later stages of production. The secondary production of glass typically involves processes of colouring, remelting, shaping and decorating of the glass object.  While some archaeological evidence suggests the concurrence of both primary and secondary glass production at the same site, in the case of glass beads these processes often occurred separately.  As access to premade glass and foreign colorants increased, beadmaking from imported goods developed into a technology which could be conducted in virtually any location across the globe.10\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Beadworking\">Beadworking</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=History_of_glass_in_sub-Saharan_Africa&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10\" title=\"Edit section: Beadworking\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Glass_beadmaking\" title=\"Glass beadmaking\">Glass beadmaking</a></div>\n<p>The production of beads from imported glass shards, cullet (scraps) and undesired glass beads has a lively presence in Sub-Saharan history.

The archaeological evidence of beadworking in Sub-Saharan Africa provides examples of both types.5 9 <sup id=\"cite_ref-david_2-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-david-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Wound_Glass_Beads\">Wound Glass Beads</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=History_of_glass_in_sub-Saharan_Africa&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11\" title=\"Edit section: Wound Glass Beads\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>With melted glass working, beads found were generally formed by either a wound, drawn or moulded process.

Sources for such glass included scraps from broken glass bottles, cullets (recycled glass) or pre-existing glass beads which were no longer wanted.  The grinding process generally caused colouring to be lost; therefore, various pigments were often added at this stage (see the colouring section below).  After the desired colour was achieved, powdered glass was either worked in its dry form or was wetted with water or saliva to create a paste.  This paste was next formed by hand into various bead shapes.  Powder Glass Beads were then heated, allowed to cool and finally, polished.8 Garden Roller beads, such as the Bodom beads of Ghana.8 were the earliest form of  powder glass beads found, made by threading glass in a mould with a mandrel.  This process was extremely labour-intensive and expensive as the mould used was unable to be reused.8 More common were the Kiffa beads, typically associated with Mauritania.  These beads were produced from the wet-form of powder glass production, and have been found since the 8th century.  The paste produced in wet-form production was shaped into a bead using frames typically made of leaves of grass and then were decorated and coloured using a needle.8\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Lapidary_Beads\">Lapidary Beads</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=History_of_glass_in_sub-Saharan_Africa&amp;action=edit&amp;section=15\" title=\"Edit section: Lapidary Beads\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Though technically made from glass, the lapidary style of bead production is more akin to stone working than proper glass manufacturing.  This process involved the recycling of imported glass by chipping, knapping, drilling and polishing pieces to a desired bead form.  Evidence from areas outside of Ile-Ife, Nigeria suggests that individuals scavenged for discarded glass remains from earlier burial sites at Olokun Grove.  Glass remains that had been brought to the upper soil layers (either naturally or via \u201cmining\u201d) were collected and worked to produce new glass beads.4\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Colouring\">Colouring</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=History_of_glass_in_sub-Saharan_Africa&amp;action=edit&amp;section=16\" title=\"Edit section: Colouring\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Colouring of glass could either be achieved by adding bits of pre-existing coloured glass, such as bottle shards or beads, by adding scrap metals, or by adding mineral pigments directly.9 The beads found in Sub-Saharan Africa generally contained the following pigment sources: Red was achieved by adding small amounts of metallic copper.  The presence of Iron could also produce a red colour, as well as form green and brown tones.3 <sup id=\"cite_ref-david_2-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-david-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> When copper was present and cooled in an oxidizing atmosphere (i.e. great exposure to oxygen) glass could achieve a blue-green colour.<sup id=\"cite_ref-david_2-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-david-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> To get a clear blue colour cobalt was often used.3 To produce a purple colour manganese was added, and in the right environments manganese was also used as a decolouring agent.<sup id=\"cite_ref-david_2-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-david-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>  Yellow and opaque white were created by the addition of antimony and lead or tin and lead and if a stronger orange colour was desired zinc was then added as well.<sup id=\"cite_ref-david_2-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-david-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>  While the colouring of imported glass certainly took place in local Sub-Saharan beadworking sites, this does not imply that the minerals utilized came from local sources.  Many glass pigments were most likely imported from abroad to Sub-Saharan beadworking sites.3\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Beadworking_Sites\">Beadworking Sites</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=History_of_glass_in_sub-Saharan_Africa&amp;action=edit&amp;section=17\" title=\"Edit section: Beadworking Sites\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Archaeological evidence, coupled with historical documentation and oral tradition provide evidence of numerous Sub-Saharan beadmaking sites.

It is not known whether the Carnelian was a local material; however, bead production has been confirmed due to the discovery of lumps of imported raw glass and other glassworking equipment.5 Mapungbwe, South Africa provides another example of beadmaking.  This site dates between 600-1200AD and contains evidence of glass working from pulverized bottles, ingots and other beads.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Dubin_1-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Dubin-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Primary_Production_Evidence\">Primary Production Evidence</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=History_of_glass_in_sub-Saharan_Africa&amp;action=edit&amp;section=18\" title=\"Edit section: Primary Production Evidence\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The most conclusive archaeological evidence for the primary production of glass in Sub-Saharan Africa comes from Ile-Ife, Nigeria, though finds in Gao, Mali, Benin and Ghana also support such inferences.4 Crucibles with glass layering and exterior vitrification indicative of production from raw materials prompted further compositional analysis.  Archaeologist concluded that the glass found in the crucibles of Ile-Ife had a uniquely high percentage of lime and alumina compounds,4 a glass formula known only to exist in Korea.  Importation of glass from Korea can be ruled out as this area only produced small quantities of glass, supplies no evidence of glass bead production and mainly only experimented with glazing.4 European, Middle Eastern, Indian and Chinese origins for the glass found at Ile-Ife can also be excluded as none of these traditions produced glass high in both lime and alumina.4 It has been suggested that this unique high-lime, high alumina glass could represent an entirely new glass making technology6 in which the alkali (soda) and alumina were derived from separate mineral sources.  The lime source would also have been added separately; most probably in the form of limestone, marble or shell.6 These proposed sources for lime, native to Nigeria and other Sub-Saharan regions, comprise a novel yet plausible primary production process.  Neighbouring areas, such as the sites at Ita Yemoo and Igbo-Ukwu, contain glass working evidence such as crucibles, cullets, and beads, all with high-lime, high-alumina glass compositions suggesting the secondary production of glass imported from Ile-Ife.4 Whether primary production technology was learned and transferred from abroad or locally invented is unknown.  Most reasonably, the presence of imported glass beads pre-existed primary production technology which was later developed through processes of trial and error.4 6 The invention of glass distinctive to Sub-Saharan Africa could have been spurred due to a shortage of imported glass beads as material accessibility and supply often directed the course of glass production technology throughout the course of history (See History of Glass).\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=History_of_glass_in_sub-Saharan_Africa&amp;action=edit&amp;section=19\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-Dubin-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\">^ <a href=\"#cite_ref-Dubin_1-0\"><sup><i><b>a</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Dubin_1-1\"><sup><i><b>b</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Dubin_1-2\"><sup><i><b>c</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Dubin_1-3\"><sup><i><b>d</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Dubin_1-4\"><sup><i><b>e</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Dubin_1-5\"><sup><i><b>f</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Dubin_1-6\"><sup><i><b>g</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Dubin_1-7\"><sup><i><b>h</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Dubin_1-8\"><sup><i><b>i</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Dubin_1-9\"><sup><i><b>j</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Dubin_1-10\"><sup><i><b>k</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Dubin_1-11\"><sup><i><b>l</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Dubin_1-12\"><sup><i><b>m</b></i></sup></a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Dubin 1987</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-david-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\">^ <a href=\"#cite_ref-david_2-0\"><sup><i><b>a</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-david_2-1\"><sup><i><b>b</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-david_2-2\"><sup><i><b>c</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-david_2-3\"><sup><i><b>d</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-david_2-4\"><sup><i><b>e</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-david_2-5\"><sup><i><b>f</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-david_2-6\"><sup><i><b>g</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-david_2-7\"><sup><i><b>h</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-david_2-8\"><sup><i><b>i</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-david_2-9\"><sup><i><b>j</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-david_2-10\"><sup><i><b>k</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-david_2-11\"><sup><i><b>l</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-david_2-12\"><sup><i><b>m</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-david_2-13\"><sup><i><b>n</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-david_2-14\"><sup><i><b>o</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-david_2-15\"><sup><i><b>p</b></i></sup></a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Davidson 1972</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-3\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-3\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><cite class=\"citation news\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/glass-africa-made-before-european-arrival-colonialisation-advanced-technology-a8168601.html\">\"Glass was made in Africa centuries before arrival of Europeans\"</a>. <i>The Independent</i><span class=\"reference-accessdate\">.
