  The Edinburgh School refers to a group of 20th century artists connected with Edinburgh. Most studied at Edinburgh College of Art during or soon after the First World War, and some taught there together in the mid-20th century. As friends and colleagues, they discussed painting and were influenced by one another's work. Art critic Giles Sutherland, writing in The Times, has suggested: "The work of the Edinburgh School is characterised by virtuoso displays in the use of paint, vivid and often non-naturalistic colour and themes such as still-life, seascape and landscape."  The following are generally thought of as Edinburgh School painters. Some other painters associated with Edinburgh may also be called Edinburgh School artists, or a 'new generation' of the Edinburgh School. The 'Edinburgh School' refers to a group of artists whose work shares certain characteristics and is not the same as the 'Edinburgh School of Art'. This latter name is quite often used for the college even though it has been officially called Edinburgh College of Art since 1907.
