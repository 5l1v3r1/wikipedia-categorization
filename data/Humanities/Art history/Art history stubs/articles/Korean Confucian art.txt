Korean Confucian art took strong hold with the Yi generals who set in place the Joseon dynasty which distinguished itself in many ways by promoting Confucian thought as the basis for a new national vision. Differentiating itself by restraint, spartan choices of color, and design, understatement, and great care and precision, the legacy of this art since the 13th century has been extensive throughout Asia. Confucian art was inspired of course by Confucius. Confucian art originated in China, then spread westwards on the Silk road, southward down to southern China and then onto Southeast Asia, and eastwards through northern China on to Japan and Korea.  Korean flower arrangement is part of the Confucian tradition.
