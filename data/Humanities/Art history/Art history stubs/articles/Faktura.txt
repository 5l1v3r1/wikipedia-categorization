"Fakture" was the single most important quality of these art objects, according to the critic Victor Shklovsky, referring to the material aspect of the surface.    The surface of the object had to demonstrate how it had been made, exhibiting its own distinct property.  Faktura-The visual demonstration of properties inherent to materials. -Example: Corner Counter Relief - Vladimir Tatlin, 1915
