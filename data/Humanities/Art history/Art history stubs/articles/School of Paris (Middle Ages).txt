School of Paris refers to the many manuscript illuminators, whose identities are mostly unknown, who made Paris an internationally important centre of illumination throughout the Romanesque and Gothic periods of the Middle Ages, and for some time into the Renaissance.  The most famous of these artists were Master Honor√©,  Jean Pucelle   and Jean Fouquet.   The Limbourg brothers,  originally from the Netherlands, also spent time in Paris, as well as Burgundy and Bourges, but their style is not typical of the School of Paris of the day.  Many of the painters in Parisian workshops were women. Master of Robert Gaguin
