Otto Dempwolff (25 May 1871 in Pillau, Province of Prussia  â€“ 27 November 1938, in Hamburg) was a German linguist and anthropologist who wrote about Austronesian languages. He was the first to publish a theory proposing that many languages that are spoken on the islands of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Ocean can be traced back to one proto-language.
