See also Weak inflection In the Icelandic language, nouns are considered weak if they fulfill the following conditions: Masculines: An example of the latter is nemandi (student), plural nemendur. The words bóndi (farmer) and fjandi (enemy or the devil or a demon) belong to this class with some irregularities. The plural of bóndi is bændur. Fjandi has two plurals, depending on the meaning. If it means an enemy, the plural is fjendur (note the retention of je). If it means a demon, the plural is fjandar. Exceptions do exist, for instance Grikki (Greek), plural Grikkir. The same applies to  Tyrki (Turk) plural Tyrkir. Both, incidentally, end in -ja in the oblique cases (Grikkja is the accusative, dative and genitive for one Greek). Feminines: Neuters: An almost exhaustive list follows: Then there are a small number of borrowings like firma, drama, þema etc. none of which require translation.
