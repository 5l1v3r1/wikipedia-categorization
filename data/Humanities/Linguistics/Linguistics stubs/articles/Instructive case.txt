In the Finnish language, the instructive case has the basic meaning of "by means of". It is a comparatively rarely used case, though it is found in some commonly used expressions, such as omin silmin → "with one's own eyes". In modern Finnish, many of its instrumental uses are being superseded by the adessive case, as in "minä matkustin junalla" → "I travelled by train." It is also used with Finnish verbal second infinitives to mean "by ...ing", e.g. "lentäen" → "by flying", "by air" ("lentää" = "to fly"). In Estonian, the instructive case (Estonian: viisiütlev) also exists, but only in some words. (f.e: "jalgsi" - "on foot", from "jalg" - foot) In Turkish, the suffix -le is used for this purpose. Ex: Trenle geldim "I came via train".
