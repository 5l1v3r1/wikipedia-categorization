The vast majority of loanwords from the Turkic languages in the Armenian language are geographically located close to Turkic-speaking regions.  This concerns, first of all, the Istanbul Armenian dialect of the language in which most of borrowings from Turkish language.  However, the influence of the Turkic languages spread not primarily a literary language, and mainly on the dialects.[clarification needed] Therefore, Turkic loanwords are only to a negligible extent preserved in the literary language. In general, according to Hrachia Acharian, both versions of literary Armenian language contain very little Turkic loanwords.  The language of the Ashiks was full of dialect, as well as Turkic and Iranian loanwords.  Some Turkic loanwords became international words, found in other languages as well as Armenian and Turkic.
