In rhetoric, parechesis (παρήχησις) is the repetition of the same sound in several words in close succession.   An example of a parechesis is: "He persuades the Pithian (πείθει τὸν Πειθίαν)."  Hermogenes of Tarsus discusses parechesis in his work On the invention of arguments (Περὶ εὑρέσεως).  Alliteration (initial rhyme) is a special case of parechesis.  It is related to paronomasia.
