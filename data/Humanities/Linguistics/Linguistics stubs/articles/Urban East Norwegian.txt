Urban East Norwegian (UEN) or Standard East Norwegian (Bokmål: standard østnorsk, Nynorsk: standard austnorsk) is the de facto standard variety of East Norwegian and an unofficial spoken standard of Bokmål. It is often used in news readings on radio and television, and it is also the variety of Norwegian that is most commonly taught to foreign students.
