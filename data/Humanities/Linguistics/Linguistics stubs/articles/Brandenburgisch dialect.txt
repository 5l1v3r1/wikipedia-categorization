Brandenburgish, or Markish, is a dialect spoken in Germany in the northern and western parts of Brandenburg (Uckermark, Prignitz and Mittelmark regions) as well as in northern Saxony-Anhalt (Altmark). The language area can be further divided between into North Markish (Stendal, Wittenberge, Prenzlau) and Central Markish (Brandenburg an der Havel). Brandenburgish was the East Low German dialect of the Brandenburg margraviate, but it has been much influenced by the East Central German dialects and by Standard German. With the arisal of the Berlin metropolitan area the original Brandenburgisch together with Berlinerisch has formed the local Lausitzisch-neumärkisch dialects, which today are considered an East Central German subgroup. The spread of Lausitzisch-neumärkisch into the Markish language area is an ongoing process.
