Distancing language is phrasing used by a person to "distance" themselves from a statement, either to avoid thinking about the subject or to distance themselves from its content. Euphemistic in nature, distancing language is often a means of self-deception, but distancing language used orally may indicate that a person is lying. This is especially apparent when someone is attempting to avoid consequences that they believe may arise from their statements or while trying to justify the unpleasant content of their statements by trivializing it. Circumlocution, synecdoches, metaphors, trivialization, innuendos, litotes, meiosis, elegant variation, equivocation, etc. are all readily used to this end. Various other examples of distance language exist, perhaps to the point where no list could be exhaustive.
