A lexical chain is a sequence of related words in  writing, spanning short (adjacent words or sentences) or long distances (entire text). A chain is independent of the grammatical structure of the text and in effect it is a list of words that captures a portion of the cohesive structure of the text. A lexical chain can provide a context for the  resolution of an ambiguous term and enable identification of the concept that the term represents. Examples of lexical chains are the following: Rome → capital → city → inhabitant Wikipedia → resource → web
