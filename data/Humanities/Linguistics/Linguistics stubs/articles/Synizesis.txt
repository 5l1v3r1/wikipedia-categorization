Synizesis (/ˌsɪnəˈziːsɪs/) is a sound change (metaplasm) in which two originally syllabic vowels are pronounced as a single syllable without change in writing.  In Latin and Greek, the reason was often to preserve meter, but similar changes can occur naturally. A tie may be used to represent this pronunciation: dē͡hinc (i.e., deinc). Homer (Iliad 1.1–2): Vergil's Aeneid: Synizesis comes from the Greek συνίζησις "a sitting together" from σύν "with" and ἵζω "I sit".
