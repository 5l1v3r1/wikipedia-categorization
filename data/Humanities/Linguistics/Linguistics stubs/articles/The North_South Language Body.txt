The North/South Language Body (Irish: An Foras Teanga Thuaidh/Theas;  Ulster-Scots: Tha Noarth/Sooth Boord o Leid  or The Language Curn)  is an implementation body, provided for by the Belfast Agreement, that exists to implement policies agreed by Ministers in the North/South Ministerial Council (NSMC) in Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland  with regard to the Irish and Ulster-Scots (or "Ullans") languages on a cross border all Island basis. It is a single body reporting to the North/South Ministerial Council, but composed of two separate and largely autonomous agencies: Foras na Gaeilge, the Irish language agency, and Tha Boord o Ulst√®r-Scotch, the Ulster-Scots Agency.
