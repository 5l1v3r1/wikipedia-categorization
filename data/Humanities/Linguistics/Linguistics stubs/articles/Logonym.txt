Within the field of linguistics the term  logonym is used to refer to the name of a particular language, dialect, or language variety. Logonyms may be either officially recognized names (e.g., via a governmental authority or the ISO 639-3 code) or less formal or standard names used by speakers or non-speakers to denote a particular language.  The term logonym is sometimes used interchangeably with ethnonym; however, the former differs from the latter because it refers specifically to a language rather than an ethnic group. Thus, two different ethnic groups speaking the same language may share the same logonym while retaining different ethnonyms. Logonyms are also distinct from demonyms, which are used to speak about the native people of a certain place, but it is possible for a logonym and a demonym to be the same. For example, someone from Germany may be described as a German and may also speak the language German. The term logonym often appears in discussions about the appropriateness or inappropriateness of particular appellations, or namings, i.e. arguments about whether certain namings are offensive or improper.
