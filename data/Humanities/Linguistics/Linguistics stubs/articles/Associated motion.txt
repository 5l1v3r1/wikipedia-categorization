Associated motion is a grammatical category whose main function is to associate a motion component to the event expressed by the verbal root. This category is attested in Pama–Nyungan languages, where it was first discovered (Koch 1984, Wilkins 1991), in Tacanan (Guillaume 2006, 2008, 2009), and in Rgyalrong languages (Jacques 2013). Languages with Associated Motion present a contrast between association motion and purposive motion verb constructions, as in the following examples from Jacques (2013:202-3): Although both examples have the same English translation, they differ in that (2) with the translocative associated motion prefix ɕ- implies that the buying did take place, while (1) with the motion verb does not. The distinction made by the translocative is similar to the distinction made in "I went and bought things".
