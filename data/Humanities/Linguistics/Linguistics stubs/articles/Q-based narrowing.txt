In the framework of Yale linguist Laurence Horn's Neo-Gricean approach to semantics and pragmatics,  Q-based narrowing or a "Q-based implicature" is an inference that results from application of the Q-Principle "Say as much as you can [given R]," as it interacts with the R-Principle "Say no more than you must [given Q]."   A Q-based inference is built around the assumption that if the speaker did not make a stronger statement (or say more), then its denial is (implied to be) true. For instance, the inference from "He entered a house" to "He did not enter his own house" is Q-based inference, i.e. deriving from the Q-Principle.
