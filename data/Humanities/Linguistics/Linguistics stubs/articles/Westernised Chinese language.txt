Common Chinese-language errors by non-native learners of Chinese (sometimes called Westernised Chinese (Chinese: 西式中文)), usually refers to a pattern of written or spoken Chinese language, characterised by the significant influence from European languages, with regards to grammar, vocabulary, syntax and word order. Influences from English are particularly noticeable, especially in translations of literary works and documents in English. Westernised Chinese lacks the characteristics of traditional Chinese writing, and sometimes poses reading or understanding difficulties to readers because of its awkwardness and/or wordiness.  It is probable that most Westernized Chinese translations are a very direct translation from English into Chinese by native Chinese speakers, given the virtually non-existent demand for native English speakers to perform written translation into Chinese.  In the first half of the 20th century, Lu Xun advocated that translations of Western works into Chinese closely follow the Western structure, but Lu Xun's arguments failed to be persuasive, and translators subsequently used a more natural translation style from English to Chinese. In Taiwan, another symptom is sentence prolonging. A possible source is Japanese working class greeting phrases, where longer sentences equate to more polite. In addition, the Taiwan restaurant industry has been heavily influenced by Japanese counterpart, combined with more demanding 'service attitude' has deepened the belief of long sentences mean politeness.  However, longer sentences take more time to read and response, which can have the opposite effect of the 'politeness' attempt.  In addition, Japanese customers value convenience stores with shorter greetings.
