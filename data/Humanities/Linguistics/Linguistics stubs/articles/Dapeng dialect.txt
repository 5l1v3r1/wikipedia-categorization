Dapeng dialect (simplified Chinese: 大鹏话; traditional Chinese: 大鵬話) is a Chinese dialect, a variant of Cantonese with a strong Hakka influence that was originally only spoken on the Dapeng Peninsula of Shenzhen, Guangdong, China. The Chinese diaspora has spread the dialect to places with large populations whose ancestral roots are originally from Dapeng, Shenzhen, Guangdong. Today, their descendants living in Hong Kong, as well among overseas Chinese living in the Randstad region of The Netherlands, Portsmouth, UK and New York City, United States have a lot of Dapeng dialect speakers. The dialect is a form of junhua, created as a lingua franca by soldiers at the Dapeng Fortress, who spoke various forms of Cantonese and Hakka.  Despite strong influence from Hakka, some, including Lau Chun-Fat, have classified it as a Guan–Bao dialect.
