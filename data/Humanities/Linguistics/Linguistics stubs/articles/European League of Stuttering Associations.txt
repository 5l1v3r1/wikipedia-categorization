The European League of Stuttering Associations (ELSA) was set up in 1990 by organisations in 12 countries to promote a greater knowledge and understanding of stuttering and to bring together, as a top umbrella organisation, the national stuttering self-help organisations of Europe. ELSA is a trans-national, cross-cultural organisation. It seeks resources only open to multi-national groups, extends the exchange-of-information network, and lobbies for stutterers at a prominent international level. Its main roles are: ELSA's work has been recognised by the International Labour Office in Geneva, the World Health Organisation in Geneva and the United Nations Office in Vienna. ELSA is also a founding member of the European Disability Forum, an umbrella disability organisation based in Brussels. The current executive board consists of Edwin Farr MBE  (Chair),  Anita Blom (Vice-Chair) and Richard BourgondiÃ«n (Webmaster).  The Association publishes a newsletter, One Voice,  which is published twice a year and is a joint project with the International Stuttering Association.  Together with the International Fluency Association and the International Stuttering Association,  the International Stuttering Association celebrates, every 22 October, International Stuttering Awareness Day (ISAD) which includes an online conference on stuttering  and a media campaign.
