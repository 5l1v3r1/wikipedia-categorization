In grammar, denominal verbs are verbs derived from nouns. Many languages have regular morphological indicators to create denominal verbs. English examples are to school, from school, meaning to instruct; to shelve, from shelf, meaning to put on shelves; and to symbolize, from symbol, meaning to be a symbol for. Some common denominalizing affixes in English are -ize/-ise (e.g., summarize), -ify (e.g., classify), -ate (e.g., granulate), en- (e.g., enslave), be- (e.g., behead), and zero or -âˆ… (e.g.,, school).  A variety of semantic relations are expressed between the base noun X and the derived verb; there is no simple relationship between the affix and the semantic relation:  In Rgyalrong languages, denominal derivation are extremely developed and have given rise to incorporating and antipassive constructions (Jacques 2012, 2014). Many Latin verbs are denominal.  For example, the first declension verb coronare (to crown) is derived from corona (a crown),  and the fourth declension verbs mollire (to soften) and servire (to serve) are derived from mollis (soft) and servus (a slave) respectively.
