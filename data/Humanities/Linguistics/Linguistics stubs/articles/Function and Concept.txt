"Function and Concept" (German: Über Funktion und Begriff, "On Function and Concept") is an article by Gottlob Frege, published in 1891. The article involves a clarification of his earlier distinction between concepts and objects. In general, a concept is a function whose value is always a truth value (139).  A relation is a two place function whose value is always a truth value (146). Frege draws an important distinction between concepts on the basis of their level.  Frege tells us that a first-level concept is a one-place function that correlates objects with truth-values (147).  First level concepts have the value of true or false depending on whether the object falls under the concept.  So, the concept                         F                 {\displaystyle F}     has the value the True with the argument the object named by 'Jamie' if and only if Jamie falls under the concept                         F                 {\displaystyle F}     (or is in the extension of F). Second order concepts correlate concepts and relations with truth values.  So, if we take the relation of identity to be the argument                         f                 {\displaystyle f}    , the concept expressed by the sentence:                         ∀         x         ∀         y         f         (         x         ,         y         )         →         ∀         z         (         f         (         x         ,         z         )         →         y         =         z         )                 {\displaystyle \forall x\forall yf(x,y)\rightarrow \forall z(f(x,z)\rightarrow y=z)}     correlates the relation of identity with the True. The conceptual range (Begriffsumfang) follows the truth value of the function:
