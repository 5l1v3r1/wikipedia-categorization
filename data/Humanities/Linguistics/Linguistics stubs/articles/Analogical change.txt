In language, an analogical change is the process of inventing a new element in conformity with some part of the language system that you already know. For instance, child learns pairs like dog/dogs, cat/cats and is then able to form other plurals. The way in which analogy can lead to a change is seen when the child learns words like man and mouse, and forms the analogical plurals mans and mouses (instead of men and mice).
