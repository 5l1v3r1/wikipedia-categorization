Insular Scots comprises varieties of Lowland Scots generally subdivided into: Both dialects, especially Shetlandic, share much vocabulary with the now extinct Norn language, unlike other dialects of Scots, due to the strong influence of Scandinavia    in the region.  The Viking invasions of the islands in the early middle ages replaced the indigenous Pictish language with their own tongues, which eventually evolved into the Norn language. Although the islands thereafter owed allegiance to Norway, they became involved politically with Scotland. Scotland annexed the islands in 1472 which led to the replacement of Norn by Scots.  It should not be confused with the vernacular of the Islands of the Clyde.
