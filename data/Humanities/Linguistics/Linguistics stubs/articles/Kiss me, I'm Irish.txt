Kiss me, I'm Irish is a common phrase associated with St. Patrick's Day. It often appears on T-shirts.   It originates from the legend of the Blarney Stone, which is believed to bring luck and eloquence to those who kiss it.  According to Jemma Tosh of Manchester Metropolitan University, the phrase is related to anti-Irish racism and sexual violence: "Whether it is the popular 'Kiss me I'm Irish' or the more aggressive 'Rape me I'm Irish' 'joke,' the conceptual Irish body is positioned as an object for others to act upon."  In one of Stuart Edge's videos, he went out with two friends holding "Kiss me, I'm Irish" signs and received some positive responses.   Saturday Night Live aired a sketch on St. Patrick's Day called "Kiss me, I'm Irish" that took the form of a dating show.   It portrayed Irish people as dating their cousins and being deformed from inbreeding. It was criticized on Twitter.
