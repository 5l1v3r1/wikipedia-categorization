Aphorismus (from the Greek: ἀφορισμός, aphorismós, "a marking off", also "rejection, banishment") is a figure of speech that calls into question if a word is properly used ("How can you call yourself a man?").  It often appears in the form of a rhetorical question which is meant to imply a difference between the present thing being discussed and the general notion of the subject.
