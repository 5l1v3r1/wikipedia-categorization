In certain languages, the final form is a special character used to represent a letter only when it occurs at the end of a word.  Some languages that use final form characters are: Arabic, Hebrew, Manchu and one letter in Greek (ς). The lowercase Latin letter "s" had separate medial (ſ) and final (s) in the orthographies of many European languages from the medieval period to the early 19th century; it survived in the German Fraktur script until the 1940s. In the Hebrew alphabet the final form is called sofit (Hebrew: סופית‎, meaning "final" or "ending"). The following five  Hebrew letters take a final form: This set of letters is known acronymically as אותיות מנצפ"ך. The now final forms ן ץ ף ך predate their non-final counterparts; They were the default forms used in any position within a word. Their descender eventually bent forwards when preceding another letter to facilitate writing. A final form of these letters is also called pshuta (פשוטה, meaning extended or plain). The Letter מ also had a descender (𐡌), however, its current final form ם was a variant of מ used interchangeably in all positions. One instance of a medial ם is preserved in the Hebrew Bible (Isaiah 9:6). Arguably, Genesis 49:19-20 have a final מ. Modern Hebrew uses the forms פ כ finally, when transcribing a plosive pronunciation, for example מיקרוסקופ (microscope), מובארכ (Mubarak, مبارك).
