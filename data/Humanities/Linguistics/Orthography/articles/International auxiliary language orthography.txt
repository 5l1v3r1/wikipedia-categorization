International auxiliary language orthography (IAL orthography) is often simplified when compared with natural language orthography. Most IALs use a Latin-script orthography and Latin-script alphabet for their standard writing. Lingua Franca Nova is additionally defined in Cyrillic script. Most IAL writing systems use only letters from the ISO basic Latin alphabet. Some exceptions are: Some IALs do not use digraphs: Uropi, Esperanto (standard system), Lingua Franca Nova. Some IALs use digraphs: The basic ordering of the letters is as in the ISO basic Latin alphabet. Esperanto sorts each letter with diacritic mark directly after the corresponding letter without such a mark. Uropi sorts the non-ASCII Ê’ after all ASCII letters, i.e. after z.
