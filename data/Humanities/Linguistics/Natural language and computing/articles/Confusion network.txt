A confusion network is a natural language processing method that combines outputs from multiple machine translation systems.   The defining characteristic of confusion networks is that they allow multiple ambiguous inputs, deferring committal translation decisions until later stages of processing.   This approach is used in the open source machine translation software Moses  and the proprietary translation API in IBM Bluemix Watson.
