If the clerk had proceeded to explain what chocolate filbert is, then it is possible that the customer would have asked for some. By explaining what the product is, the clerk would have tacitly implied that he had some to sell. Describing a product in a selling situation is often an implication that it is available. A waiter, for example, would not launch into a detailed description of a particular dish that a customer is inquiring about, only to end the discourse by then informing the customer that the dish is not available.\n</p><p>Another common collapsing sequence is illustrated below:\n</p><p>A. <i>Do you smoke?</i>\nB. <i>I left them in my other jacket.</i>\n</p><p>This type of collapsing sequence speeds up social interaction by averting unnecessary explanations.\n</p><p>Collapsing sequences can be used in other situations as well, such as when someone joins a discussion already in progress:\n</p><p><i>Hi, John. We were just talking about nursery schools.</i>\n</p><p>In the phrasing of this response, the speaker is either warning John not join the group, or is giving him orientation so that he can understand the context of the discussion and participate.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Collapsing_sequence&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Cooperative_principle\" title=\"Cooperative principle\">Cooperative principle</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Collapsing_sequence&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li>Chaika, Elaine. <i>Language: The Social Mirror</i>.
