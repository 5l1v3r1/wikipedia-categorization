The Resource Network for Linguistic Diversity (RNLD) is an international non-profit organisation which was established to advance the sustainability of the world's Indigenous languages. RNLD was founded in 2004 by linguists Margaret Florey and Nicholas Thieberger as a resource organisation aiming to support linguistic diversity by offering a range of training programs, facilitating networking between language maintenance practitioners, and maintaining a website with various practical resources. RNLD (Inc.) is incorporated in Victoria, Australia, and is registered as a tax-exempt organisation.    Funded activities by RNLD are primarily supported by the Indigenous Languages Support (ILS) grant scheme from the Government of Australia.  The Resource Network for Linguistic Diversity states the following mission on the organisation website: RNLD's mission is to advance the sustainability of Indigenous languages and to increase the participation of Indigenous peoples in all aspects of language documentation and revitalisation through training, resource sharing, networking, and advocacy. Through our activities, we contribute to the holistic health and wellbeing of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities by providing direct relief from the suffering and distress that arises from the loss of Indigenous languages and the consequent alienation from cultural heritage and Indigenous identity. RNLD provides a range of resources to support language documentation and revitalisation activities. These include information about national and international funding opportunities for language work,  links to blogs and networks  including the active RNLD email discussion list,  and other resources for language documentation and revitalisation such as information about software, language materials, language centres, equipment for language work, orthography development, data management, training programs, and language documentation projects.
