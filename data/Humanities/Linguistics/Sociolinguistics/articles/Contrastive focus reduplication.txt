Contrastive focus reduplication, also called lexical cloning or the double construction, is a type of syntactic reduplication found in some languages. Doubling a word or phrase – such as do you LIKE-like him? –  can indicate that the prototypical meaning of the repeated word or phrase is intended.  U.S. writer Paul Dickson coined the term word word in 1982 to describe this phenomenon.  The first part of the reduplicant bears contrastive intonational stress. Contrastive focus reduplication in English can apply not only to words but also to multi-word phrases such as idioms, or to word stems without their inflectional morphemes. The authors of the article that defined contrastive focus reduplication collected a corpus of examples in English.   These include: The poem "After the Funeral"  by Billy Collins contains many examples of contrastive focus reduplication.
