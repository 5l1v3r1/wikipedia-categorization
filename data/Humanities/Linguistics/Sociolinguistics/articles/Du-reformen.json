Less respectfully, people could be addressed with Mr./Mrs./Ms. plus surname, or in a family setting, alternatively even less respectfully, with the plain name or third person pronoun <i>han</i> (\"he\") or <i>hon</i> (she).\n</p><p>Before <i>du-reformen,</i> it was considered impolite to address most people without an appropriate title, although a subordinate could be addressed by name, or less respectfully as <i>Ni</i> or <i>han/hon.</i> The informal <i>du</i> had been used for addressing children, siblings, close friends and possibly for <a href=\"/wiki/Cousin\" title=\"Cousin\">cousins</a>, but hardly for elder relatives. Members of <a href=\"/wiki/Free_church\" title=\"Free church\">Free churches</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Good_Templars\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Good Templars\">Good Templars</a> and the like considered each other as siblings, and may well have used <i>Du</i> in that setting.\n</p><p>With exception for <a href=\"/wiki/Dialect\" title=\"Dialect\">dialectal</a> usage, the second person plural pronoun <i>Ni</i> had long been considered degrading when used to address a single person.

But with persons of higher standing, say a doctor, count or managing director, there arose the question when to use that title only and when to precede it with a <i>herr</i> ('mister' or, in this context, 'sir'); not doubling such titles could be very rude unless you were on somewhat informal terms.  A woman, married to a husband with a specific title, was addressed using the <i>feminine form of her husband's title</i> as a matter of course. This created its own set of problems as more and more women acquired professional titles of their own.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>If two persons were somewhat acquainted and not too far apart in rank and age, they could then drop the name and use the <b>title only</b>.</li></ul>\n<ul><li><b>Surname without title</b> was considered proper between friends not too close and for a superior to his subordinate or someone of similar rank. That was also customary in male brotherhoods like between students.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Below that on the social scale, both among peers and from above, was the <b>third person singular pronoun only</b> (<i>han</i> 'he', <i>hon</i> 'she'). That was more usual in the countryside; considered rustic by \"educated\" people, but fitting towards e.g. an old fisher- or woodman.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Simple folks of venerable age could be properly addressed <b>father/mother/aunt plus Christian name</b> <i>(far/mor/moster)</i>, both by their own, by other villagers and by superiors. A farmwife could be addressed as <i>mor</i> even if young; otherwise, one had to make do with the nearest-fitting other way of addressing.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>A master could address his servant, and a farmer his farmhand, by <b>Christian name in the third person</b>; that was more common between females, as the female world was generally more confined, but more restricted between the sexes. A subordinate, in each case, answered by using the superior's title or, in private, the informal term for his rank (e.g. <i>herrn</i>, <i>patron</i>).</li></ul>\n<ul><li>The proper <b>kinship term plus Christian name</b>, still never alternating with pronoun, was proper in private to nearer relatives.</li></ul>\n<p>The second person singular <i>du</i> was used only to and between children, within a married couple, between lovers or to a more or less voluntary mistress of lower standing, and between friends who had toasted for brotherhood with each other ('toasted for thou' in a <i>\"du-sk\u00e5l\"</i> as it was known)\u2014of course initiated by the elder or higher-ranked party. Again, the custom could be slightly more relaxed among women\u2014at least the toast itself was usually dispensed with. Otherwise, <i>du</i> could be used to insult a tramp or the like.\n</p><p>Parts of this system began to erode around the Second World War or so, but the essentials held up into the late 1960s.\n</p><p>In the province of <a href=\"/wiki/Dalarna\" title=\"Dalarna\">Dalarna</a>, however, and in a some other remote places with few upper-class people, the <i>du/ni</i> distinction had remained one of number only; although children addressed their parents with Father/Mother <i>(Far/Mor)</i> rather than a grammatically logical <i>du.</i> In other remote places, the <i>Ni</i> survived in its older form <i>I</i> (cognate with '<a href=\"/wiki/Ye_(pronoun)\" title=\"Ye (pronoun)\">ye</a>') as both the second person plural pronoun and the polite address to singular elders, including one's parents, unless classified with \"better people\". In <a href=\"/wiki/Standard_language\" title=\"Standard language\">standard</a> Swedish, that form had become archaic and solemn well before the 20th century. (<i>I</i> is capitalized to avoid confusion with a common <a href=\"/wiki/Homograph\" title=\"Homograph\">homograph</a>, the preposition <i><a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/i#Swedish\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikt:i\">i</a></i> ('in'), rather than of respect.)\n</p><p>As the twentieth century progressed, this circumlocutive system of addressing, with its innumerable ambiguities and opportunities for unintentional offence, was increasingly felt as a nuisance. An early way out was to carry the circumlocutions one degree further\u2014finding impersonal ways of saying what was needful, avoiding both personal pronoun and title (<i>F\u00e5r det lov att vara en kopp kaffe?</i>, approximately 'Might it be a cup of coffee?'; <i>S\u00e5 det \u00e4r till att resa?</i>, approximately 'So, it is about travelling?'), often using the <a href=\"/wiki/Passive_voice\" title=\"Passive voice\">passive voice</a>. However, that soon proved of little avail. For one thing, you still had to address the person you talked with directly from time to time in the conversation, otherwise you would really have sounded impolite\u2014and over time, it became <i>de rigueur</i> to do so more and more often, until it was a system with both longish titles used instead of personal pronouns and impersonal circumlocutions; and for another, the impersonal constructions soon acquired their own gradations, to be observant upon\u2014e.g., that in the second example above being perceived as more and more rustic, ending up rude.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Reform\">Reform</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Du-reformen&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Reform\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The beginning of <i>du-reformen</i> is associated with <a href=\"/wiki/Bror_Rexed\" title=\"Bror Rexed\">Bror Rexed</a>, the then head of the <a href=\"/wiki/National_Board_of_Health_and_Welfare_(Sweden)\" title=\"National Board of Health and Welfare (Sweden)\">National Board of Health and Welfare</a> (<i>Socialstyrelsen</i>), who in his welcome speech to the staff in 1967 announced that he would address everyone as <i>du</i>, increasing the effects of the reform and bringing it to a more frequent use. \n</p><p>The actual reform had started earlier, including the amended language in the major newspaper <a href=\"/wiki/Dagens_Nyheter\" title=\"Dagens Nyheter\">Dagens Nyheter</a>. It was seen as a reform in a democratic and egalitarian direction. First, authorities and influential circles had tried rehabilitating the <i>Ni</i> in a so-called \"<i>ni</i>-reform\". But most people could not bring themselves to feel civil using that. Then, in a process dubbed the \"<i>du</i> reform\", the system rapidly broke down and the informal <i>du</i> became the accepted way of addressing any one person except royalty.\n</p><p>Addressing <a href=\"/wiki/Swedish_Royal_Family\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Swedish Royal Family\">Swedish Royal Family</a> also changed, but third person addressing still dominates in official settings. The universal <i>ers majest\u00e4t</i> ('Your Majesty'), etc. became rare, possibly used on formal occasions, and is replaced by <i><a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/konung#Swedish\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikt:konung\">konungen</a></i> or <i><a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kung#Swedish\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikt:kung\">kungen</a></i> (\"the King\"), <i>kronprinsessan</i> (\"the Crown Princess\"), etc. \n</p><p>In parallel with <i>du-reformen</i>, the use of <a href=\"/wiki/Title\" title=\"Title\">titles</a> was further reduced. In many other countries, <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Professional_title&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Professional title (page does not exist)\">professional titles</a> rather than names are used to attract someone\u2019s attention, while this is not usually the case in Sweden. Only slightly less accepted is the use of <a href=\"/wiki/Christian_name\" title=\"Christian name\">Christian name</a> also when addressing an  acquaintance or colleague (<i>Daniel, Pia,</i> etc.).\n</p><p>Since about 1990, it has become somewhat more common for retail and restaurant staff to address customers as <i>ni</i> (second-person plural), although this was not formerly considered formal language.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> In the <a href=\"/wiki/Riksdag\" title=\"Riksdag\">Riksdag</a>, where debate is conducted via the <a href=\"/wiki/Speaker_of_the_Riksdag\" title=\"Speaker of the Riksdag\">Speaker</a>, titles are frequently used, even though politicians are most often addressed as <i>du</i> in other contexts.\n</p><p>In order to \"alleviate the intrusion\" in writing, e.g. in letters or in advertisement, the <i>Du</i> can be capitalized. That usage was most widespread in the early days of universal <i>du</i> address; it has become slightly more common again simultaneously with the partial <i>Ni</i> revival.\n</p><p><br />\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Du-reformen&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><cite class=\"citation web\">Hellstr\u00f6m, Elin (Jun 7, 2011). <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://archive.is/20120911224725/http://www.sweden.se/eng/Home/Education/Swedish-language/Reading/How-the-Swedish-language-lost-its-formality/\">\"How the Swedish language lost its formality\"</a>. <i>sweden.se</i>. <a href=\"/wiki/Swedish_Institute\" title=\"Swedish Institute\">Swedish Institute</a>.
