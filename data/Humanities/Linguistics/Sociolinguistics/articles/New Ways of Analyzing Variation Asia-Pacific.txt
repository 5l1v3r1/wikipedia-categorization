New Ways of Analyzing Variation Asia-Pacific (NWAV Asia-Pacific) is an annual academic conference in sociolinguistics and the first sister conference of New Ways of Analyzing Variation. NWAV Asia-Pacific focuses on research based on empirical data with an emphasis on quantitative analysis of variation and change across the Asia-Pacific region, including speech communities, multilingualism, urbanization and migration, sociophonetics, style-shifting, language contact, variation in minority languages, dialect variation and change, dialect contact, variation in acquisition, language change across the lifespan, perceptual dialectology, and other related topics such as technological resources for sociolinguistic research. The first NWAV Asia-Pacific conference was held at University of Delhi, India in February, 2011, which included an inaugural conference address by William Labov. NWAV Asia-Pacific 2 was held in Tokyo in August 2012 at the National Institute for Japanese Language and Linguistics. NWAV Asia-Pacific 3, hosted by Victoria University of Wellington, took place 1-3 May 2014 in New Zealand. The fourth conference in the series, NWAV Asia-Pacific 4, was held at National Chung Cheng University in Chiayi, Taiwan, in April 2016, featuring invited presenters William Labov, Gillian Sankoff, James Myers, Dennis Preston, Miriam Meyerhoff, Daming Xu and Jingwei Zhang. NWAV-AP5 will be held in Brisbane, Australia in 2018. The NWAV Asia/Pacific conference series has also led to the founding of a new peer-reviewed journal focused on language variation and change in this region: Asia-Pacific Language Variation (Benjamins Publishing).
