In AAVE, use of <i>be</i> indicates that a subject repeatedly does an action or embodies a trait. In <a href=\"/wiki/Standard_English\" title=\"Standard English\">Standard English</a>, the use of (an inflection of) <i>be</i> merely conveys that an individual has done an action in a particular tense, such as in the statement \"She was singing\" (the habitual being \"she sings\").\n</p><p>It is a common misconception that AAVE speakers simply replace <i>is</i> with <i>be</i> across all tenses, with no added meaning. In fact, AAVE speakers use <i>be</i> to mark a habitual <a href=\"/wiki/Grammatical_aspect\" title=\"Grammatical aspect\">grammatical aspect</a> not explicitly distinguished in Standard English. For example, to <i>be singing</i> means <i>to sing habitually,</i> not <i>to presently be singing.</i> In one experiment, children were shown drawings of <a href=\"/wiki/Elmo\" title=\"Elmo\">Elmo</a> eating cookies while <a href=\"/wiki/Cookie_Monster\" title=\"Cookie Monster\">Cookie Monster</a> looked on. Both black and white subjects agreed that Elmo <i>is</i> eating cookies, but the black children said that Cookie Monster <i>be</i> eating cookies.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Hypothesized_sources\">Hypothesized sources</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Habitual_be&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Hypothesized sources\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The source of habitual <i>be</i> in AAVE is still disputed. Some linguists suggest it came from the finite <i>be</i> in the 17th to 19th century English of British settlers (perhaps especially those from <a href=\"/wiki/West_Country_English\" title=\"West Country English\">South West England</a>, although the usage may be latterday \"<a href=\"/wiki/Mummerset\" title=\"Mummerset\">Mummerset</a>\" in this context), while other linguists believe that it came from Scots-Irish immigrants whose <a href=\"/wiki/Ulster_Scots_dialects\" title=\"Ulster Scots dialects\">Ulster Scots dialects</a> mark habitual verb forms with <i>be</i> and <i>do be</i>.\n</p><p>One hypothesis is that habitual <i>be</i> simply diffused into New World Black English from <a href=\"/wiki/Hibernian_English\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hibernian English\">Hibernian English</a> (HE) through contact in the Caribbean. Some evidence is that the two dialects structure sentences with the habitual <i>be</i> almost identically:\n</p><p>(1)\t<i>Even when I do be round there with friends, I do be scared.</i> (HE)\n</p><p>(2)\t<i>Christmas Day, well, everybody be so choked up over gifts and everything, they don't be too hungry.</i> (AAVE)<sup id=\"cite_ref-Rickford1986_3-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Rickford1986-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Criticism of the hypothesis stems from the fact that there is no evidence that <i>be</i> was used as a habitual marker in the past or is used today in Caribbean creoles of English.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Rickford1986_3-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Rickford1986-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> Instead, Caribbean English speakers use the preverbal <i>does</i> to mark habitualness. They use <i>be</i> only as filler between <i>does</i> and the sentence's predicate.\n</p><p>The hypothesis states that the geographical differences in use of <i>be</i> and <i>do (be)</i>, by Northern and Southern HE speakers respectively, accounts for the difference in use of be and does (be) in AAE and Caribbean English respectively.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Rickford1986_3-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Rickford1986-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> During the 17th and 18th centuries, Northern HE speakers immigrated more to North America, and Southern HE speakers immigrated to the Caribbean Islands, both working alongside blacks. Although the expansion to include the differences in the dialects of HE accounts for the absence of habitual be in Caribbean English creoles, the hypothesis has its disadvantages as well. The first problem is the distribution of <i>do</i> and <i>be</i> again. In Southern HE, <i>do</i> is more common with <i>be</i> than other verbs, but in Caribbean English, <i>does</i> is less common with <i>be</i> than other verbs.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Rickford1986_3-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Rickford1986-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> Hibernian English marks habitualness on be, and Caribbean English rarely marks it, if at all. A second problem is that there is not sufficient evidence to show that Southern HE speakers did not introduce <i>do (be)</i> to the American colonies since there were Southern HE speakers in the colonies that worked closely with blacks.\n</p><p>A further expansion and modification of the diffusion hypotheses account for the periphrastic do found in Caribbean English creoles. The <i>do</i> feature was common in British English and persisted in the nonstandard Southern and Southwestern English dialects that were used by the white colonials in the Caribbean colonies.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Rickford1986_3-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Rickford1986-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> The Irish and the blacks were both learning English at the same time, and both groups learned a new language while retaining the conventions of their native languages. In America, the Irish feature habitual be may have diffused into AAE and the two assemblages of people were in close contact and communicating with a new tongue. It is possible that British dialects could have had features that served as models for habitual <i>do (be)</i> in the Caribbean creoles, which, in turn, expanded to AAE in the Americas. It is also worth noting that Southern and Southwestern British immigrants traveled to the American colonies as well and their dialects would have been used as a model to blacks, leading to a drawback, the introduction, and subsequent loss of habitual <i>do (be)</i> in America, which was also the problem with the first expansion of the diffusion hypothesis.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Rickford1986_3-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Rickford1986-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> Another hypothesis for the origins of habitual <i>be</i> in NWBE and afterwards into AAE is the most logical and the strongest of the lot.\n</p><p>The decreolization theory for the emergence of habitual <i>be</i> in AAE is the most likely and most supported of the theories of its origin. It involves the decreolization process of Caribbean English creole, with the loss of <i>does (be)</i>, which itself is a decreolization of a previous creole habitual marker and its co-occurrence with <i>be</i>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Rickford1986_3-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Rickford1986-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> The process is seen as one code-shifting in the series of English learned by blacks in the New World. The existence of a category of habituals in the native Caribbean languages at the basilectal level shows that over time, blacks learned English but kept the conventions of their native languages until code-shifting replaced these old conventions with new ones. The evidence that Rickford gives is as following:\n</p><p>(18) Habitual aspect with a prepositional phrase or locative:\n</p><p>Stage 1: He (d)a de [dc] in the bed. (basilect)\n</p><p>Stage 2: He does de in the bed. (hab. (d)a -&gt; does)\n</p><p>Stage 3: He does be in the bed. (loc. cop. de -&gt; be)\n</p><p>Stage 4: He 0 be in the bed. (does -&gt; 0; be 'habitual')\n</p><p>This data is just one set of three, with this one preceding a predicate containing a prepositional phrase, and shows the shifting from the basilectal, native language convention, level to the English habitual be level in stage 4, with the coexistence of two or more stages at once.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Rickford1986_3-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Rickford1986-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> It is hypothesized that the first three stages were present in the speech of plantation slaves, and the hypothesis appears to be supported by the presence of these stages today on the Sea Islands of the United States, with only stage four surviving anywhere else in America.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Rickford1986_3-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Rickford1986-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> The advantages of this hypothesis are that there is no assumption that blacks had no native language influence and that the conventions of English were perfectly copied to the emerging English grammars of blacks and the fact that the decreolizing of habitual be also follows the pattern of decreolization in general linguistics and the pattern in cultural anthropology, with formal approximations of English over time and cultural assimilation of language respectively.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Rickford1986_3-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Rickford1986-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> Another merit is that this same pattern of decreolizing of be is found in other creoles that are relatively close to AAE and affirm the plausibility of this origin for habitual be. Yet another merit for this hypothesis is that it can incorporate the strong points of the revised diffusion hypotheses and surmount the weaknesses associated with them. For instance, creoles and dialects have lexicons that derive from the languages that feed them, and AAE and Caribbean English are no different; they followed the models of language dialects that came in contact with them and used their native language conventions as well as the newly learned conventions to mutate into varieties of the model language. A possible disadvantage of the hypothesis is that it does not work for area in which creoles did not develop, such as areas of America with very few blacks in the population.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Rickford1986_3-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Rickford1986-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> Another possible disadvantage is that the sources of slaves for the differing regions of America and the Caribbean could have led to different creole starting points, leading to the different habitual markers in AAE and Caribbean English creoles. The two minor problems are far outweighed by the advantages that the hypothesis has and further affirm that it is the best possible origin of habitual <i>be</i>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Habitual_be&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><cite class=\"citation web\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://www.pbs.org/speak/education/curriculum/high/aae/#aaegram\">\"Do You Speak American.
