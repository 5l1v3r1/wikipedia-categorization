This is the sense of meaning at work when asking a person when they leave a theater, \"What did that movie mean to you?\" In short, the word \"meaning\" can sometimes be used to describe the <i>interpretations</i> that people have of the world. Example: \"Chunks are pieces of information linked and bound by meaning. (Remembering details vs. getting an overall meaning) links individual memory traces together, to create conceptual chunks.\" (Dr. Barbara Oakley, A Mind for Numbers, p.&#160;55).\n</p><p>The field of <a href=\"/wiki/Semantics\" title=\"Semantics\">semantics</a> is often understood as a branch of <a href=\"/wiki/Linguistics\" title=\"Linguistics\">linguistics</a>, but this is not strictly true.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources. (October 2012)\">citation needed</span></a></i>&#93;</sup> Basic or non-idealized <b>meaning</b> as a type of <a href=\"/wiki/Semantics\" title=\"Semantics\">semantics</a> is a branch of <a href=\"/wiki/Psychology\" title=\"Psychology\">psychology</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Ethics\" title=\"Ethics\">ethics</a> and reflects the original use of the term \"meaning\" as understood early in the 20th century by <a href=\"/wiki/Lady_Welby\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Lady Welby\">Lady Welby</a> after her daughter had translated the term \"semantics\" from French. On the other hand, meaning, in so far as it was later objectified by not considering particular situations and the real intentions of speakers and writers, examines the ways in which words, phrases, and sentences can seem to have meaning. Objectified semantics is contrasted with communication-focused semantics where understanding the intent and assumptions of particular speakers and writers is primary as in the idea that people mean and not words, sentences or propositions. An underlying difference is that where causes are identified with relations or laws then it is normal to objectify meaning and consider it a branch of linguistics, while if causes are identified with particular agents, objects, or forces as if to cause means to influence as most historians and practical people assume, then real or non-objectified meaning is primary and we are dealing with intent or purpose as an aspect of human psychology, especially since human intent can be and often is independent of language and linguistics.\n</p><p>We are all familiar with how good or bad reputation can encourage or discourage us from reading or studying  about certain people, positions, or philosophies even before we have studied them. This is normally called pre-judgment or prejudice. To determine whether a reputation is deserved we normally have to carry out extensive and balanced research into human intent and assumptions in psychology, and in the sphere of language and linguistics where this research tends to focus not only on the differences between denotation and connotation, but especially on the presence and often tenacious character of value connotation, that is, the good or bad associations we make with words. Re-definition can change denotation for some people, but value connotation almost always remains, and is merely re-directed at a different target. Unfortunately, while dictionaries mention the most common denotations or main meanings we associate with words they normally ignore value connotation. Indeed, it is value connotation or the effect of using it which results in denotation becoming prejudicial, even denotation which is imagined to be fair,  neutral or objective. Indeed, much rhetoric is based on selecting words more for their value associations than for their denotations, and to expose and correct this bad habit it is normally wise to focus on the most likely intent and assumptions of particular people than to imagine that words have meaning in themselves or that either meaning or language can be genuinely objective, since in that process we are likely to forget the existence and dominating character of value connotation which is subjective in a bad sense, that is, which makes persuasion more an aspect of rhetoric and deception rather than judging people, positions and philosophy more by weight of evidence or legitimate argumentation.\n</p><p>One way to operationally define the meaningfulness of a stimulus is to look at the slope of the response time versus response probability line (Tarnow, 2007).<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Semantic_meaning\">Semantic meaning</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Meaning_(non-linguistic)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Semantic meaning\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">See also: <a href=\"/wiki/Biosemiotics\" title=\"Biosemiotics\">Biosemiotics</a></div>\n<table class=\"plainlinks metadata ambox ambox-style ambox-Tone\" role=\"presentation\"><tbody><tr><td class=\"mbox-image\"><div style=\"width:52px\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/60px-Edit-clear.svg.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/80px-Edit-clear.svg.png 2x\" data-file-width=\"48\" data-file-height=\"48\" /></div></td><td class=\"mbox-text\"><div class=\"mbox-text-span\">This section's <b>tone or style may not reflect the <a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Writing_better_articles#Tone\" title=\"Wikipedia:Writing better articles\">encyclopedic tone</a> used on Wikipedia</b>.<span class=\"hide-when-compact\"> See Wikipedia's <a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Writing_better_articles#Tone\" title=\"Wikipedia:Writing better articles\">guide to writing better articles</a> for suggestions.</span>  <small><i>(August 2017)</i></small><small class=\"hide-when-compact\"><i> (<a href=\"/wiki/Help:Maintenance_template_removal\" title=\"Help:Maintenance template removal\">Learn how and when to remove this template message</a>)</i></small></div></td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>In another sense, the word \"meaning\" can be used to describe the internal workings of the mind, independently of any linguistic activity. This sort of meaning is deeply psychological. If we look for other uses we can find intent, feeling, implication, importance, value, and signification. Since the negative form-- \"meaningless\"\u2014challenges and would deny these uses, experts believe that underlying them all are understanding and understandability.\n</p><p>One approach to this way of understanding meaning was the psychosocial theorist <a href=\"/wiki/Erik_Erikson\" title=\"Erik Erikson\">Erik Erikson</a>. Erikson had a certain perspective on the role of meaning in the process of human bodily development and socialization. Within his model, a \"meaning\" is the external source of gratification associated with the human erogenous zones and their respective modes. See <a href=\"/wiki/Imprinting_(psychology)\" title=\"Imprinting (psychology)\">imprinting (psychology)</a> for some related topics.\n</p><p>Some communication by <a href=\"/wiki/Body_language\" title=\"Body language\">body language</a> arises out of bodily signals that follow directly out of human instinct.  <a href=\"/wiki/Blushing\" title=\"Blushing\">Blushing</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Tears\" title=\"Tears\">tears</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Erections\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Erections\">erections</a> and the <a href=\"/wiki/Startle_reaction\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Startle reaction\">startle reaction</a> are examples.

Now, the identity of a habit depends on how it might lead us to act, not merely under such circumstances as are likely to arise, but under such as might possibly occur, no matter how improbable they may be.\n...I only desire to point out how impossible it is that we should have an idea in our minds which relates to anything but conceived sensible effects of things.
