Denotation is a translation of a sign to its meaning, precisely to its literal meaning, more or less like dictionaries try to define it. Denotation is sometimes contrasted to connotation, which includes associated meanings. The denotational meaning of a word  is perceived through visible concepts, whereas connotational meaning evokes sensible attitudes towards the phenomena.  In logic, linguistics and semiotics, the denotation of a word or phrase is a part of its meaning; however, the part referred to varies by context: The denotation of this example is a red rose with a green stem. The connotation is that it is a symbol of passion and love â€“ this is what the rose represents. The denotation is a brown cross. The connotation is a symbol of religion, according to the media connotation. However, to be more specific this is a symbol of Christianity. The denotation is a representation of a cartoon heart. The connotation is a symbol of love and affection.
