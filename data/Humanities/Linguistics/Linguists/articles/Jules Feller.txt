Jules Feller (4 November 1859, Roubaix – 29 April 1940, Verviers) was a  Belgian academician and Walloon militant. Jules Feller created the 'Feller system' ('fr:Système Feller') of spelling for the Walloon language. This is also used for writing the Picard language since a consensus arose between universities in favour of the written form known as 'Feller-Carton' (based on the Walloon spelling system – which was developed by Feller and adapted for Picard by Prof. Fernand Carton). He represented Verviers in the Walloon Assembly from 1919 until his death. He was a member of the  Royal Academy of French Language and Literature in Belgium.
