Jules Gilliéron (December 21, 1854 – April 26, 1926) was a Swiss-French linguist and dialectologist. From 1883 until his death, he taught dialectology at the École pratique des hautes études in Paris.  In 1887, he co-founded the Revue des patois gallo-romans (Journal of Gallo-Romance dialects), which was published until 1893.  His most notable work was the monumental Atlas Linguistique de la France (Linguistic Atlas of France), published between 1902 and 1910.
