After spending two years in the US Army, he studied at Cornell University (1970–72) to complete a Master of Arts degree in linguistics. After a year lecturing at the Heidelberg University, he returned to Cornell in 1975 to carry out doctoral studies, and was awarded his PhD in 1978 for his thesis "The structure of intonational meaning". Having spent a year lecturing at Cornell, he lectured at the University of Cluj as a Fulbright Scholar (1978–79), before holding a number of short-term positions at Cornell (1979–80, 1984), the University of Pennsylvania (1980–81), Bucknell University (1980–81), the University of Giessen (1981–83) and the University of Sussex (1983–84), before being appointed a lecturer in the Department of Linguistics at the University of Edinburgh in 1985.

Ladd retired in 2011 and became an emeritus professor and honorary professorial fellow at Edinburgh.    According to his British Academy profile, Ladd's research focuses on "phonology and phonetics, and the relation between them ('laboratory phonology')", as well as "intonation and prosody, including focus, emotion, pitch perception, tone languages, and links between language and music".  In 2015, Ladd was elected a Fellow of the British Academy, the United Kingdom's national academy for the humanities and social sciences.  The following year, he was elected a Member of the Academia Europaea.
