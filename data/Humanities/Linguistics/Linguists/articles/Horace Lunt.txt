As a student of Roman Jakobson at Columbia, he joined the Harvard University faculty in 1949 together with his mentor. There he taught the course on Old Church Slavonic grammar for four decades, creating what has become the standard handbook on it, now in its seventh edition. He published numerous monographs, articles, essays, and reviews on all aspects of Slavic comparative and historical linguistics and philology. He also wrote the first English grammar of the Macedonian language in the early 1950s. He died at the age of 91. He was survived by his wife, Sally Herman Lunt, daughters Catherine and Elizabeth, five grandchildren, and son-in-law David.
