First, message engagement, which is a <a href=\"/wiki/Stimulus_(psychology)\" title=\"Stimulus (psychology)\">stimulus</a> approach/avoidance interaction engages the appetitive and aversive cognitive subprocesses. In the most lay terms, these are basic fight or flight responses that happen in mere nanoseconds. This information then can report to sensor stores in the brain; and if it is useful, it will move to short term memory and long term memory.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Cognitive_resources\">Cognitive resources</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=LC4MP&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Cognitive resources\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>There are several key concepts in the LC4MP: total resources, resources allocated, resources required, resources remaining, and resources available. Total resources refer to the total resources in the resource pool. Resources allocated refer to the resources that are actually available for a processing task. The resource allocated to a task may be equivalent to the total resources, but probably is not. <i><b>Resources required</b></i> are the amount of resources necessary to complete a task (<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://drive.google.com/a/mix.wvu.edu/file/d/0B8r89BbARRQISG5NR2l4a3NFMm8/view?usp=sharing\">See Total-Allocated-Required Resources</a>.).  <i><b>Resources remaining</b></i> refer to the difference between total resources and resources required. <i><b>Resources available</b></i> are the difference between the resources allocated and the resources required.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> Resources remaining and resources available may be the same if total resources are equivalent to resources allocated, but this is unlikely the case. <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://drive.google.com/a/mix.wvu.edu/file/d/0B8r89BbARRQISG5NR2l4a3NFMm8/view?usp=sharing\">See the overall picture of mental resources in information processing.</a>\n</p><p>The reasons for these fine-tuned distinctions are several. First, people may not allocate all of the available resources to a task at hand because they are <a href=\"/wiki/Cognitive_miser\" title=\"Cognitive miser\">cognitive misers</a>. Unless highly motivated, people tend to use as few resources as necessary. Thus, a distinction is made between total resources and allocated resources. Second, people will allocate resources only as required by the task. If people are watching a program they have seen before, fewer resources may be required because of the familiarity of the program. Conversely, if the production is such that the visual elements of the programming are important, then more resources may be required. In both cases, the same amount of resources may have been allocated to the TV program, but different amounts were actually used, leaving some allocated resources available in one case but not in another. Third, some elements in the environment will automatically draw resources. For example, formal features automatically attract attention (e.g., unrelated cuts), drawing required resources from the total pool of resources without conscious allocation of resources. In this case, the difference between the automatic attraction (i.e., required) of resources and the total resources leaves some remaining resources for allocation to other tasks.\n</p><p>Within this model, media messages may receive insufficient or limited processing for two basic reasons (i.e., cognitive overload). First, there may not be enough resources available to process the message fully (i.e., the required resources exceed the total resources). For example, a message on a topic that a person does not understand may require so many resources \u2013 perhaps trying to retrieve information from long-term memory \u2013 that, even though all resources may have been allocated to the task, the required resources for retrieval leave neither remaining nor available resources for attending to and encoding the message. Second, there may be enough resources available to process the message but those resources are not allocated to the task for reasons such as insufficient motivation or because the person is multitasking (e.g., resources required exceeds resources allocated). For example, when a person is cooking and watching TV at the same time, there may not be enough resources available to process the TV program entirely.\n</p><p>Watching TV involves a number of simultaneous cognitive processes. TV viewing often requires people to engage in processing auditory and visual information, and integrating these two channels of information.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> At the same time, both the auditory and visual information include the content of the program as well as the formal features of TV which can act as syntax for the programming. The viewer must integrate all of this information to understand the program. In addition, viewers are storing new information in memory and activating existing knowledge to aid in comprehending the program. Research under the rubric of the LC4MP focuses on how resources are allocated to the various processes that are occurring and the effects of differential resource allocation on attention, encoding, and retrieval.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Encoding.2C_storage.2C_and_retrieval\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Encoding,_storage,_and_retrieval\">Encoding, storage, and retrieval</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=LC4MP&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Encoding, storage, and retrieval\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Encoding of information is a subprocess where a stimulus orients a person to a message, vel non. In terms of message processing, its effectiveness is determined by the number of cognitive resources allocated to the encoding process.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> If the person is exposed to a stimulus, and they choose to pay attention, the brain will treat that mediated message like it was reality. That is, the brain creates an \"<a href=\"/wiki/Orienting_response\" title=\"Orienting response\">orienting response</a> (OR), which is an automatic cognitive response to novel information\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> This response is a cognitive reaction to a change in the environment,<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> and can be measured via implicit measures of recognition and explicit measures such as <a href=\"/wiki/Electrochemical\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Electrochemical\">electrochemical</a> reactions in the body.<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> These cognitive processes can be both automatic, as in the case of OR\u2019s, or controlled. In either event, the next step in the message engagement process is to move the information into storage.\n</p><p>Storage is conceptually modeled as a cognitive sub-processing of information into and through the general associative network.<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> Associative networks are conceptual \u201cnodes\u201d that map brain uses as sensor stores\u2014for short-term and long term memory.<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> They are conceptualized as the site where information is stored and ultimately retrieved. Under normal conditions, if there are many associative links available for information processing, \u201cthe more readily retrievable that information will become\u201d;<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> hence, then \u201cretrieval\u201d time of information is faster and more accessible. Storage of information is measured via <a href=\"/wiki/Cued_recall\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cued recall\">cued recall</a>.\n</p><p>Information retrieval is conceptualized as the third fundamental conceptual sub process of information processing, and it is a function of memory, which is measured via free recall. Measuring free recall is based on an individual\u2019s levels of sensitivity to stimuli, without being cued to the information.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Cognitive_memory\">Cognitive memory</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=LC4MP&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Cognitive memory\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Automatic cognitive responses are elicited via a cognitive response to novel information, the primary method in which automatic responses are elicited is through structural cues of the communication situation.<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> Lang, et al. (2000) elaborates on this by controlling the structural features. They discovered that the relatedness of the media messages mattered. They dissected the pacing of mediated content into two categories: one that used related editing in camera angle and content; and, another with unrelated cuts to unrelated information to the previous information that was being encoded and stored.<sup id=\"cite_ref-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup> These pacing cues are important to media producers because they can either help reinforce attention into memory; or they can created a low memory retention condition in the minds of the message processor.\n</p><p>By inserting edits, which are operationalized by the process of switching cameras or transitions in visual or audio media, media producers can elicit orienting responses in attentive viewers. This is accomplished because the mechanism of allocating resources to memory message processing is effective in low, medium, and high edit conditions.<sup id=\"cite_ref-14\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup> Therefore, retrieval is also possible and is measured via recognition testing. However, unlike related editing cues, unrelated cuts do not make it into memory, especially when the cuts are coming at the message processor rapidly. This is important, secondarily, because the entire illusion of a commercially driven media system is premised on the concept that advertising sells products. More importantly, this article's primary concern is to instruct media producers\u2014who are concerned with generating public information, the importance of editing cues, and the deleterious uses of disparate advertising and its ineffectiveness.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Methods\">Methods</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=LC4MP&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Methods\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Methodologically, the LC4MP uses three primary sets of measures to study how people allocate resources and process information. Secondary task reaction time (STRT) is a measure of the amount of resources allocated to attention. STRT involves people engaging in a primary task such as watching TV while also monitoring a second task such as pressing a button whenever a cue such as a tone sounds or a light comes on.<sup id=\"cite_ref-15\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup> The amount of resources that are available (i.e., resources allocated minus resources required) has been demonstrated to influence how long it takes people to respond in the STRT.<sup id=\"cite_ref-16\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-16\">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup> When there are a lot of resources available, people quickly notice the light or tone and are quick to press a button. But when resources are low or taxed, people take longer to notice the light or tone and are slower to respond. For example, a cut to an unrelated scene tends to tax resources because of the new information that needs to be processed, and STRT is slower. Critically, STRT is a function of both the resources allocated to the task and the resources required by the task.<sup id=\"cite_ref-17\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-17\">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>A second set of methodological tools involves physiological measures such as heart rate, galvanic skin responses (sweating) or muscle activity. Heart rate is used as a measure of whether an orienting response has occurred.<sup id=\"cite_ref-18\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-18\">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup> When people show an aroused response, their heart rate decelerates for a few seconds before returning toward their baseline. Likewise, an increase in skin conductance is evidence of an aroused response. Thus, the combined evidence of heart rate deceleration and an increase in skin conductance provides convergent evidence that an orienting response (OR) has occurred.\n</p><p>A final set of methodological tools involves measures of memory including recall and recognition measures.<sup id=\"cite_ref-19\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-19\">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup> The measures of memory are used to make inferences about encoding and retrieval processes. For example, if messages are simple, increasing people\u2019s attention to a message through the inclusion of formal features that orient attention, such as edits, results in improvements in memory for the message. This finding suggests that there were available resources (i.e., more resources allocated than required) that could be diverted to encoding processes. Conversely, with a complex message, the addition of features that increase ORs tends to lead to decrements in memory, which suggests that ORs automatically drew resources away from encoding processes and resulted in worse memory. The decreased performance on memory tests is one indication that the resources required has exceeded the resources allocated to the task.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Limits_of_LC4MP\">Limits of LC4MP</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=LC4MP&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Limits of LC4MP\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The ability of information processing of <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Mediated_messages&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Mediated messages (page does not exist)\">mediated messages</a> has limits. Interference with the encoding, storage, and retrieval of messages; especially when the receiver is not interested in the message, creates a situation where the required resources needed to process information are not dedicated; and, \u201cfewer associative links will be made available to the message... therefore, it limits their ability to process media\u201d (<sup id=\"cite_ref-20\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-20\">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup>). This is a concern for researchers interested in studying how people encode and store information because if information processors do not devote the appropriate number of resources required to process information, then <a href=\"/wiki/Information_overload\" title=\"Information overload\">information overload</a> will inhibit the abilities of individuals to encoding, store, and retrieve information.<sup id=\"cite_ref-21\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-21\">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup> Additionally, the ability to information processors to process messages is also limited by their unique retrieval sub processing abilities, which are related to perceptions compiled over time.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources.

Before to point out specific limits of the view, it is useful to summarize the characteristics of information processing views for contrast. First, this view has it that information gains (e.g., learning) can be conceived as internal structures (e.g., long term memory) changing to reflect changes in the external world, which represents \"reality\". Within the traditional information processing view this real world is \"knowable\" and, as a consequence a student's knowledge can be ultimately judged as right or wrong. A second important characteristics of the information processing view is that there are general principles of learning, knowledge, etc. that hold true across situations and across learners, and it is the job of the researcher and theorist to ascertain these general principles.\n</p><p>On the other hand, a fundamental characteristic of the prototypical constructivist view is that no knowledge is absolute, rather knowledge is constructed. For example, the constructivists point to all the times in history when something was thought be a \"fact\", but was later discounted. This view is in contrast with the \"absolute reality\" basis of the information processing view. Another fundamental characteristics of the structuralist perspective is that learning only occurs within some context. So, for example, to consider learning independent of the environment in which it occurs (e.g., school, work, or play), is unrealistic and incomplete. This, again, is inconsistent with both the behaviorist and information processing views (and much of science in general, for that matter) in that these latter theories are based on the assumption that fundamental principles can be ascertained that will apply broadly across contexts and across learners.\n</p><p>These distinctions may sound quite abstract and removed from \"real life\" classroom instruction to you. In fact, in a practical/applied sense there are some important implications and practices that have emerged from this constructivist view since it has come into favor in the last decade. The general view that knowledge is not so absolute, that it is \"constructed\" puts more of an emphasis on the knowledge and conceptions that students brings to the classroom. This leads to a more \"learner centered approach\", with the teacher as more of a \"guide on the side\", as opposed to a \"sage on the stage\". Further, in a \"constructivist classroom\" students are more free to participate in the planning (i.e., \"negotiate\") and, even, the assessment process. Another implication of the \"relative\" nature of knowledge contention is that it is important to present the learner with multiple perspectives on a single topic or concept.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=LC4MP&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Media_psychology\" title=\"Media psychology\">Media psychology</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=LC4MP&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap mw-references-columns\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Lang, A.
