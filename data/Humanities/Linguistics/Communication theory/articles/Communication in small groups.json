title=\"Edit section: Group communication\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The first important research study of small group communication was performed in front of a live studio audience in Hollywood California by social psychologist Robert Bales and published in a series of books and articles in the early and mid 1950s .<sup id=\"cite_ref-Bales_5-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Bales-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-Balesss_6-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Balesss-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> This research entailed the <a href=\"/wiki/Content_analysis\" title=\"Content analysis\">content analysis</a> of discussions within groups making decisions about \"human relations\" problems (i.e., vignettes about relationship difficulties within families or organizations). Bales made a series of important discoveries. First, group discussion tends to shift back and forth relatively quickly between the discussion of the group task and discussion relevant to the relationship among the members. He believed that this shifting was the product of an implicit attempt to balance the demands of task completion and group cohesion, under the presumption that conflict generated during task discussion causes stress among members, which must be released through positive relational talk. Second, task group discussion shifts from an emphasis on opinion exchange, through an attentiveness to values underlying the decision, to making the decision. This implication that group discussion goes through the same series of stages in the same order for any decision-making group is known as the <i>linear phase model</i>. Third, the most talkative member of a group tends to make between 40 and 50 percent of the comments and the second most talkative member between 25 and 30, no matter the size of the group.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources. (March 2013)\">citation needed</span></a></i>&#93;</sup> As a consequence, large groups tend to be dominated by one or two members to the detriment of the others.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Linear_phase_model\">Linear phase model</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Communication_in_small_groups&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Linear phase model\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The most influential of these discoveries has been the latter; the linear phase model. The idea that all groups performing a given type of task go through the same series of stages in the same order was replicated through the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s; with most finding four phases of discussion. For example, communication researcher B. Aubrey Fisher showed groups going sequentially through an orientation stage, a conflict stage, a stage in which a decision emerges and a stage in which that decision is reinforced.<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> Much of this research (although not necessarily Fisher's) had two fundamental flaws. First, all group data was combined before analysis, making it impossible to determine whether there were differences among groups in their sequence of discussion. Second, group discussion content was compared across the same number of stages as the researcher hypothesized, such that if the researcher believed there were four stages to discussion, there was no way to find out if there actually were five or more. In the 1980s, communication researcher <a href=\"/wiki/Marshall_Scott_Poole\" title=\"Marshall Scott Poole\">Marshall Scott Poole</a> examined a sample of groups without making these errors and noted substantial differences among them in the number and order of stages.<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> He hypothesized that groups finding themselves in some difficulty due to task complexity, an unclear leadership structure or poor cohesion act as if they feel the need to conduct a \"complete\" discussion and thus are more likely to pass through all stages as the linear phase model implies, whereas groups feeling confident due to task simplicity, a clear leadership structure and cohesion are more likely to skip stages apparently deemed unnecessary.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Idea_development\">Idea development</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Communication_in_small_groups&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Idea development\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Another milestone in the study of group discussion content was early 1960s work by communication researchers Thomas Scheidel and Laura Crowell regarding the process by which groups examine individual proposed solutions to their problem.<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> They concluded that after a proposal is made, groups discuss it in an implied attempt to determine their \"comfort level\" with it and then drop it in lieu of a different proposal. In a procedure akin to the survival of the fittest, proposals viewed favorably would emerge later in discussion, whereas those viewed unfavorably would not; the authors referred to this process as \"spiraling.\"  Although there are serious methodological problems with this work, other studies have led to similar conclusions. For example, in the 1970s, social psychologist L. Richard Hoffman noted that odds of a proposal's acceptance is strongly associated with the arithmetical difference between the number of utterances supporting versus rejecting that proposal. More recent work has shown that groups differ substantially in the extent to which they spiral.<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> Additional developments have taken place within group communication theory as researchers move away from conducting research on zero-history groups, and toward a \"bona fide\" groups perspective. The bona fide group, as described by Linda L. Putnam and Cynthia Stohl in 1990, fosters a sense of interdependence among the members of the group, along with specific boundaries that have been agreed upon by members over time.<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> This provides researchers with model of group behavior that stays true to the characteristics displayed by most naturally occurring groups, (s).\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Social_influence_in_groups\">Social influence in groups</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Communication_in_small_groups&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Social influence in groups\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Work relevant to <a href=\"/wiki/Social_influence\" title=\"Social influence\">social influence</a> in groups has a long history. Two early examples of social psychological research have been particularly influential. The first of these was by <a href=\"/wiki/Muzafer_Sherif\" title=\"Muzafer Sherif\">Muzafer Sherif</a> in 1935 using the <a href=\"/wiki/Autokinetic_effect\" title=\"Autokinetic effect\">autokinetic effect</a>. Sherif asked participants to voice their judgments of light movement in the presence of others and noted that these judgments tended to converge.<sup id=\"cite_ref-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup> The second of these was a series of studies by <a href=\"/wiki/Solomon_Asch\" title=\"Solomon Asch\">Solomon Asch</a>, in which naive participants were asked to voice their judgments of the similarity of the length of lines after hearing the \"judgments\" of several confederates (research assistants posing as participants) who purposely voiced the same obviously wrong judgment. On about 1/3 of the cases, participants voiced the obviously wrong judgment. When asked why, many of these participants reported that they had originally made the correct judgment but after hearing the confederates, decided the judgments of several others (the confederates) should be trusted over theirs.<sup id=\"cite_ref-14\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup> As a consequence of these and other studies, social psychologists have come to distinguish between two types of social influence; informational and normative (see <a href=\"/wiki/Conformity\" title=\"Conformity\">conformity</a>). Informational influence occurs when group members are persuaded by the content of what they read or hear to accept an opinion; Sherif's study appears to be an example. Normative influence occurs when group members are persuaded by the knowledge that a majority of group members have a view. Normative influence should not be confused with compliance, which occurs when group members are not persuaded but voice the opinions of the group majority. Although some of the participants in the Asch studies who conformed admitted that they had complied, the ones mentioned above who believed the majority to be correct are best considered to have been persuaded through normative influence.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Conflict_resolution\">Conflict resolution</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Communication_in_small_groups&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Conflict resolution\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Any group has conflicts, topics that people do not agree on, different points of view on how to move forward with a task and so on. As a result, to be able to overcome any conflict that might arise, a six step conflict resolution will help to overcome the problem.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Guffey,_Mary_E._2010_15-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Guffey,_Mary_E._2010-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<ul><li>All the group members have to listen carefully to each other</li>\n<li>Understand the different points of view that were discussed</li>\n<li>Be respectful and show interest in maintaining a good relationship with the group members regardless of their opinions</li>\n<li>Try to find a common ground</li>\n<li>Come up with new solutions to the problem or situation</li>\n<li>Finally, reach on a fair agreement that will benefit everyone</li></ul>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Group_decisions\">Group decisions</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Communication_in_small_groups&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Group decisions\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>By the end of the 1950s, studies such as Sherif's led to the reasonable conclusion that social influence in groups leads group members to converge on the average judgment of the individual members. As a consequence, it was a surprise to many social psychologists when in the early 1960s, evidence appeared that group decisions often became more extreme than the average of the individual predisposed judgment.<sup id=\"cite_ref-16\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-16\">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup> This was originally thought to be a tendency for groups to be riskier than their members would be alone (the <a href=\"/wiki/Risky_shift\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Risky shift\">risky shift</a>), but later found to be a tendency for extremity in any direction based on which way the members individually tended to lean before discussion (<a href=\"/wiki/Group_polarization\" title=\"Group polarization\">group polarization</a>). Research has clearly demonstrated that group polarization is primarily a product of persuasion not compliance. Two theoretical explanations for group polarization have come to predominate. One is based on <a href=\"/wiki/Social_comparison_theory\" title=\"Social comparison theory\">social comparison theory</a>, claiming that members look to one another for the \"socially correct\" side of the issue and if they find themselves deviant in this regard, shift their opinion toward the extreme of the socially correct position.<sup id=\"cite_ref-17\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-17\">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup> This would be an example of normative influence. The other 'persuasive arguments theory' (PAT), begins with the notion that each group member enters discussion aware of a set of items of information favoring both sides of the issue but lean toward that side that boasts the greater amount of information. Some of these items are shared among the members (all are aware of them), others are unshared (only one member is aware of each). Assuming most or all group members lean in the same direction, during discussion, items of unshared information supporting that direction are voiced, giving members previously unaware of them more reason to lean in that direction.<sup id=\"cite_ref-18\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-18\">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup> PAT is an example of informational influence. Although PAT has strong empirical support, it would imply that unshared items of information on the opposite side of the favored position would also come up in discussion, canceling the tendency to polarize. Research has shown that when group members all lean in one direction, discussion content is biased toward the side favored by the group, inconsistent with PAT. This finding is consistent with social comparison notions; upon discovering where the group stands, members only voice items of information on the socially correct side. It follows that an explanation for group polarization must include information influence and normative influence.\n</p><p>The possibility exists that the majority of information known to all group members combined, supports one side of an issue but that the majority of information known to each member individually, supports the other side of the issue. For example, imagine that each member of a 4-person group was aware of 3 items of information supporting job candidate A that were only known to that member and 6 items of information supporting job candidate B that were known to all members. There would be 12 items of information supporting candidate A and 6 supporting candidate B but each member would be aware of more information supporting B. Persuasive arguments theory implies that the items of information favoring A should also come up, leading to each member changing their mind but research has indicated that this does not occur. Rather, as predicted by the merging of PAT and social comparison theory, each member would come into discussion favoring B, that discussion would be heavily biased toward B and that the group would choose B for the job. This circumstance, first studied by Stasser and Titus, is known as a \"<a href=\"/wiki/Hidden_profile\" title=\"Hidden profile\">hidden profile</a>\" and is more likely to occur as group size increases and as the proportion of shared versus unshared items of information increases.<sup id=\"cite_ref-19\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-19\">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Many methods may be used in reaching group decisions. The most popular method in Western culture is by majority, but other ways to make team decisions are available. Firstly, voting by majority brings quick decision making, and that is one of the reasons why it is the most widely used. A second method is by consensus. Reaching decisions by consensus is time consuming, but it allows everyone to bring forward their opinion. A third method is by averaging. This method requires all teammates to reach a decision by compromising. Reaching decisions by minority decision calls for a subcommittee getting together and reaching decisions without the whole groupe being involved. A final method is by authority rule. In this method, the group leader listens to individual group member's ideas, and has final say on a decision.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Guffey,_Mary_E._2010_15-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Guffey,_Mary_E._2010-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Nonverbal_communication\">Nonverbal communication</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Communication_in_small_groups&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Nonverbal communication\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Nonverbal_communication\" title=\"Nonverbal communication\">Nonverbal communication</a></div>\n<p><b>Body language</b> is a form of nonverbal communication, consisting of body pose, gestures, eye movements and paralinguistic cues (i.e. tone of voice and rate of speech).

Research has revealed that in North America there are four different zones of interpersonal space. The first zone is called intimate distance and ranges from touching to about eighteen inches apart.  Intimate distance is the space around us that we reserve for lovers, children, as well as close family members and friends.  The second zone is called personal distance and begins about an arm's length away; starting around eighteen inches from our person and ending about four feet away.  We use personal distance in conversations with friends, to chat with associates, and in group discussions.  The third zone of interpersonal space is called social distance and is the area that ranges from four to eight feet away from you.  Social distance is reserved for strangers, newly formed groups, and new acquaintances.  The fourth identified zone of space is public distance and includes anything more than eight feet away from you.  This zone is used for speeches, lectures, and theater; essentially, public distance is that range reserved for larger audiences.<sup id=\"cite_ref-25\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-25\">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Language_difficulties\">Language difficulties</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Communication_in_small_groups&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11\" title=\"Edit section: Language difficulties\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Misunderstandings in communication are common because of the many different factor, that is the way of conveying message; which is done through language.  Though there is no right or wrong way to communicate, avoiding language barriers such as jargon, bypassing, and offensive language may prevent misunderstandings in group or interpersonal discussions.\nOne of the more common barriers in communication is the inappropriate use of jargon.  Jargon is a fictive language invented by and for the group as a verbal shorthand.  It also syllabifies group membership when used properly.  The problem with jargon is that it can make words confusing and can be used to conceal the truth.\nAnother barrier to language is bypassing.  Bypassing occurs when group members have different meanings for different words and phrases and thus miss each other's meanings.  To overcome the risk of bypassing it is important to look to what the speaker wants and not always at what the speaker says.  The third most common language barrier is offensive language.  Offensive language is \"any terminology that demeans, excludes, or stereotypes people for any reason.  Avoiding sexist, discriminating, or labeling talk will greatly reduce chances of miscommunication.  Remember, there is no right or wrong way to communicate.  Though language difficulties are common, avoiding barriers like jargon, bypassing, and offensive language, will greatly reduce your chances of being misunderstood.
