Bona fide group theory is a theoretical perspective of communication in small groups that was initially developed by Linda Putnam and Cynthia Stohl in the 1990s.  Intended to provide communication theorists with a valid model of small groups on which to conduct research, this perspective focuses on the principles of communication that take place within naturally formed social groups.  This represented a shift in traditional research practices which had primarily consisted of studies on zero-history laboratory groups.  Putnam group as exhibiting stable yet permeable boundaries, interdependence with the immediate context of individual group members, and links between boundaries and context. These characteristics allow for important elements of small groups, such as fluctuation in group member commitment level and a shared sense of boundaries.  In their call for research to move its focus toward bona fide groups, Putnam and Stohl argued that this model is more ecologically valid than alternative case studies, and as such, it gives a more accurate reading of how small groups behave on a day-to-day basis.  Furthermore, since it had already helped develop current research settings, methods, and variables, it most certainly will continue to shape small group communication studies. In the time since this initial argument was proposed, social scientists have generally agreed with Putnam and Stohl, and have redirected much of their research to emphasize bona fide groups as a model of small group communication.
