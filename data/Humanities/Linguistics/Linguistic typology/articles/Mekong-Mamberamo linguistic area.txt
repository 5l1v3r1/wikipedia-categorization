The Mekong-Mamberamo linguistic area is a linguistic area proposed by David Gil (2015).  It combines the Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area with the languages of the Nusantara archipelago and western New Guinea. The linguistic area covers Mainland Southeast Asia, Malaysia (including both peninsular Malaysia and Borneo), and all of Indonesia except for the parts of central New Guinea that are located east of the Mamberamo River. Gil (2015:271) lists 17 features that are characteristic of the Mekong-Mamberamo linguistic area.
