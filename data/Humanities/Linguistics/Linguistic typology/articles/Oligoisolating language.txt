An oligoisolating language (from the Greek ὀλίγος, meaning "few" or "little") is any language using very few morphemes which tend towards an isolating structure of statements. Oligoisolation is almost entirely theoretical and would necessitate long, modifier-heavy sentences. No natural language has oligoisolating properties; nevertheless it is present in some constructed languages, such as Toki Pona and aUI.
