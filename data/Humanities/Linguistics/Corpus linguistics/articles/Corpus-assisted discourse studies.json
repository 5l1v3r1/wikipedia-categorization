Much of what carries meaning in texts is not open to direct observation: \u201cyou cannot understand the world just by looking at it\u201d (Stubbs [after Gellner 1959] 1996: 92). We use language \u201csemi-automatically\u201d, in the sense that speakers and writers make semi-conscious choices within the various complex overlapping systems of which language is composed, including those of transitivity, modality (<a href=\"/wiki/Michael_Halliday\" title=\"Michael Halliday\">Michael Halliday</a> 1994), lexical sets (e.g. <i>freedom</i>, <i>liberty</i>, <i>deliverance</i>), modification, and so on. Authors themselves are, famously, generally unaware of all the meanings their texts convey. By combining the <a href=\"/wiki/Quantitative_research\" title=\"Quantitative research\">quantitative research</a> approach, that is, statistical overviews of large amounts of the discourse in question - more precisely, large numbers of tokens of the discourse type under study contained in a corpus - with the more <a href=\"/wiki/Qualitative_research\" title=\"Qualitative research\">qualitative research</a> approach typical of discourse analysis, that is, the close, detailed examination of particular stretches of discourse it may be possible to better understand the processes at play in the discourse type and to gain access to non-obvious meanings.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"History\">History</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Corpus-assisted_discourse_studies&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: History\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>CADS arises from pioneering work conducted in Europe, in particular by Hardt-Mautner (1995) and Stubbs (1996, 2001). A considerable body of research has also been conducted in Italy either by individual researchers or under the aegis of combined inter-university projects such as <i>Newspool</i> (Partington et al. 2004) and <i>CorDis</i> (Morley and Bayley eds, 2009). It has concentrated on political and media language, mainly because a nucleus of linguists in Italian universities work in Political Science faculties and are increasingly interested in the use of corpus techniques to conduct a particular type of sociopolitical discourse analysis, including the unearthing of noteworthy ideological metaphors and motifs in the language of political figures and institutions.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Comparison_with_standard_corpus_linguistics\">Comparison with standard corpus linguistics</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Corpus-assisted_discourse_studies&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Comparison with standard corpus linguistics\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Traditional corpus linguistics has, quite naturally, tended to privilege the quantitative approach. In the drive to produce more authentic dictionaries and grammars of a language, it has been characterised by the compilation of some very large corpora of heterogeneric discourse types in the desire to obtain an overview of the greatest quantity and variety of discourse types possible, in other words, of the chimerical but useful fiction called the \u201cgeneral language\u201d (\u201cgeneral English\u201d, \u201cgeneral Italian\u201d, and so on). This has led to the construction of immensely valuable research tools such as the <a href=\"/wiki/Bank_of_English\" title=\"Bank of English\">Bank of English</a> and the <a href=\"/wiki/British_National_Corpus\" title=\"British National Corpus\">British National Corpus</a>. Some branches of corpus linguistics have also promoted an approach that is \"corpus-driven\", in which we need, grammatically speaking, a mental <i>tabula rasa</i> to free ourselves of the baleful prejudice exerted by traditional models and allow the data to speak entirely for itself.\n</p><p>The aim of CADS on the other hand is radically different. Here the aim of the exercise is to acquaint oneself as much as possible with the discourse type(s) in hand. Unusually for corpus linguistics, CADS researchers typically engage with their corpus in a variety of ways. As well as via wordlists and concordancing, intuitions for further research can also arise from reading or watching or listening to parts of the data-set, a process which can help provide a feel for how things are done linguistically in the discourse-type being studied.\n</p><p>CADS is also typically characterised by the compilation of ad hoc specialised corpora, since very frequently there exists no previously available collection of the discourse type in question. Just as typically, other corpora of various descriptions are utilized in the course of a study for purposes of comparison. These may include pre-existing corpora or may themselves need to be compiled by the researcher. In some sense, all work with corpora \u2013 just as all work with discourse - is properly comparative. Even when a single corpus is employed, it is used to test the data it contains against another body of data. This may consist of the researcher\u2019s intuitions, or the data found in reference works such as dictionaries and grammars, or it may be statements made by previous authors in the field. Corpus-assisted studies of discourse types are, of course, by definition comparative: it is only possible to both uncover and evaluate the particular features of a discourse type by comparing it with others.\n</p><p>Occasionally it is possible to compare the behaviour of the linguistic items under study in a single discourse type (or <i>monogeneric</i>) corpus with their behaviour in one of the large <i>heterogeneric</i> corpora which are commercially available, such as the <i>British National Corpus </i>or the <i>Bank of English</i> mentioned earlier. On other occasions, however, it becomes appropriate to adopt more complex procedures and to edit, tailor or compile a corpus for special purposes.\n</p><p>'<b>A basic, standard methodology in CADS may resemble the following:'</b>\n</p><p>Step 1: Decide upon the research question;\n</p><p>Step 2: Choose, compile or edit an appropriate corpus;\n</p><p>Step 3: Choose, compile or edit an appropriate reference corpus / corpora;\n</p><p>Step 4: Make frequency lists and run a keywords comparison of the corpora;\n</p><p>Step 5: Determine the existence of sets of key items;\n</p><p>Step 6: Concordance interesting key items (with differing quantities of co-text);\n</p><p>Step 7: (Possibly) refine the research question and return to Step 2.\n</p><p><i>This basic procedure can of course vary according to individual research circumstances and requirements.</i>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Research_questions_and_techniques_of_analysis\">Research questions and techniques of analysis</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Corpus-assisted_discourse_studies&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Research questions and techniques of analysis\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>CADS research projects often focus on research questions of the following types:\n</p><p>Given that P is a discourse participant (or possibly an institution) and G is a goal, often a political goal:\n</p><p><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">(i) How does P achieve G with language?</span>\n</p><p><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">(ii) What does this tell us about P?</span>\n</p><p><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">(iii) Comparative studies: how do P1 and P2 differ in their use of language? Does this tell us anything about their different principles and objectives?</span>\n</p><p>A second general type of CADS research question, which might be asked of interactive discourse data, is the following.\n</p><p><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Given that P(x) is a particular participant or set of participants, DT is the discourse type, and R is an observed relationship between or among participants:</span>\n</p><p><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">How do {P(a), P(b)\u2026P(n)} achieve / maintain R in DT [using language]?</span>\n</p><p>Another common type of research question open to investigation using CADS techniques is the following:\n</p><p><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> Given that A is an author, Ph(x) is a phenomenon or practice or behaviour, and DT(x) is a particular discourse type.</span>\n</p><p><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">A has said P(x) is the case in DT(a) </span>\n</p><p><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Is Ph(x) the case in DT(b)</span>\n</p><p>This is a classic \u201chypothesis-testing\u201d research question: we test the hypothesis that whatever practice has been observed by a previous author in some discourse type will be observable in another. It is a process we might call <i>para-replication</i>, that is, the replication of an experiment with either a fresh set of texts of the same discourse type or of a related discourse type, \u201cin order to see whether [findings] were an artefact of one single data set\u201d (Stubbs 2001: 124).\n</p><p>A final example of research question which may usefully be investigated using CADS techniques is of the following sort.\n</p><p><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> Given that P(x) is a participant or category thereof, and LF(x) is a particular language feature:</span>\n</p><p><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Do {P(a)} and {P(b)} use LF(x) in the same way?</span>\n</p><p>Such research aims to ascertain whether different participants use a particular linguistic feature in the same or different ways.
