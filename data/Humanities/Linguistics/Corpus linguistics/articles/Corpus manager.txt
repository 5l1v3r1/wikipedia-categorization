 A corpus manager (corpus browser or corpus query system) is a tool for multilingual corpus analysis, which allows effective searching in corpora.  A corpus manager usually represents a complex tool that allows one to perform searches for language forms or sequences. It may provide information about the context or allow the user to search by positional attributes, such as lemma, tag, etc. These are called concordances. Other features include the ability to search for Collocations, frequency statistics as well as metadata information about the processed text.  The narrower meaning of corpus manager refers only to the server side or the corpus query engine, whereas the client side is simply called the user interface. A corpus manager can be software installed on a personal computer or it might be provided as a web service.
