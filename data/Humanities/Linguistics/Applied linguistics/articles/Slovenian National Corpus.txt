The FidaPLUS database is an upgrade of the older (FIDA) corpus, which was developed between 1997 and 2000, with added texts that were published up to 2006 and was the result of the applicative research project of the Faculty of Arts, Faculty of Social Sciences, both University of Ljubljana, and Jo≈æef Stefan Institute's Department of Knowledge Technologies.  Corpus is available via a corpus manager Sketch Engine.  This version FidaPLUS corpus contains Word sketches, an automatic corpus-derived overview of word's grammatical and collocational behaviour.
