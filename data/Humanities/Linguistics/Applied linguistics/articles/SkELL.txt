SkELL is an abbreviation of Sketch Engine for Language Learning.  It is a web interface for language learning. The main purpose is to help students and teachers of languages. SkELL has its own corpus  that was gathered so that contained texts covering everyday, standard, formal, and professional language.  In the corpus, there are a total of more than 60 million sentences and more than one billion words.  The SkELL interface provides features such as simple search showing words in context, but the maximum of displayed lines (concordances, in fact) is 40. However, the frequency of searched query is located below the search box and expressed with the number hits per million. The second function is word sketch which enables showing collocates for a given word or words. The last one is named as similar words. It visualises similar words to searched word in a word cloud. The tool has been available also for the Russian language (since 2015)  and the Czech language (since 2017).   SkELL offers three types of searches.  The corpus for English SkELL consists of English Wikipedia (special sorted out 130,000 articles), English collection of Project Gutenberg, a subset from the web corpus enTenTen14,  the whole British National Corpus, and free new sources.  After gathering and pre-cleaning (all structures have removed except sentences) data has run through processing pipe: normalization, tokenization, TreeTagger for English, and deduplication. The further process was a compilation of the corpus using manatee indexing library. In the end, all sentences were scored with the GDEX  tool.
