Logology (or ludolinguistics) is the field of recreational linguistics, an activity that encompasses a wide variety of  word games and wordplay. The term is analogous to the term "recreational mathematics". Some of the topics studied in logology are lipograms, acrostics, palindromes, tautonyms, isograms, pangrams, bigrams, trigrams, tetragrams, transdeletion pyramids, and pangrammatic windows. The term logology was adopted by Dmitri Borgmann to refer to recreational linguistics.
