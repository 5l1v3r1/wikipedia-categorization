SQRRR or SQ3R is a reading comprehension method named for its five steps: survey, question, read, recite, and review. The method was introduced by Francis P. Robinson, an American education philosopher in his 1946 book Effective Study.  The method offers a more efficient and active approach to reading textbook material.  It was created for college students, but is extremely useful for young students as well. Classrooms all over the world have begun using this method to better understand what they are reading.  Similar methods developed subsequently include PQRST and KWL table.  Best's process of effective comprehension suggests six stages for better understanding a topic while in a learning process.
