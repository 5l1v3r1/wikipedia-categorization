Post literacy or post literacy education is a concept used in continuing education and adult education programs aimed at recently illiterate or "neo-literate" adults and communities, largely in the developing world. Unlike continuing education or further education, which covers secondary or vocational topics for adult learners, Post literacy programs provide skills which might otherwise be provided in primary education settings.   Post literacy education aims to solidify literacy education, provide resources and media aimed at the newly literate, and also may create systems of non-formal education to serve these communities. Projects include providing formal continuing education, providing  written materials (the literate environment) relevant to economic development to newly literate members of developing societies, and leveraging radio and other non-written media to increase access to educational material in informal settings.
