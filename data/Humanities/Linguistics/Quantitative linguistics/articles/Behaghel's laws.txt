Behaghel’s Laws describe the basic principles of the position of words and phrases in a sentence.   They were formulated by the Linguist Otto Behaghel in the last volume of his four volume work Deutsche Syntax: Eine geschichtliche Darstellung (published 1923-1932). They include the following cross-language principles: It is thus ensured that the utterances that the speaker finds important will remain in the thoughts of the listener, in that they are at the end of the sentence. From Behaghel’s Laws evolved the later Theme-rheme.  They serve together with other of his topics as suggestions for research in Quantitative Linguistics. Behaghel's law of increasing terms is also known as "Panini's Law" after the Sanskrit grammarian. This name was introduced by William Cooper and John Ross (1975)  in their study of English set phrases.  English examples include "free and easy", "lock, stock and barrel", "kit and (ca)boodle",  etc. Michael O'Connor (1978) has observed a similar statistical preference in the case of Biblical Hebrew poetry.
