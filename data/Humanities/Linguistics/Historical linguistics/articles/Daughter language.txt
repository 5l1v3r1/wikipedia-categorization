In historical linguistics, a daughter language or son language, also known as offspring language, is a language descended from another language through a process of genetic descent. Strictly speaking, the metaphor of the mother-daughter relationship can lead to misconceptualization of language history, as daughter languages are normally direct continuations of earlier stages, not separate entities in any way "born" to a mother who eventually dies.
