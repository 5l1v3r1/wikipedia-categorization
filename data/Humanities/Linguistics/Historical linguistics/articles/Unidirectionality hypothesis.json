{"parse":{"title":"Unidirectionality hypothesis","pageid":3420459,"revid":583631181,"text":{"*":"<div class=\"mw-parser-output\"><p>In <a href=\"/wiki/Linguistics\" title=\"Linguistics\">linguistics</a>, the <b>unidirectionality hypothesis</b> proposes that <a href=\"/wiki/Grammaticalisation\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Grammaticalisation\">grammaticalisation</a> works in a single direction. That is, <a href=\"/wiki/Pronoun\" title=\"Pronoun\">pronouns</a> may fuse with verbs, or <a href=\"/wiki/Preposition\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Preposition\">prepositions</a> may fuse with nouns, to create new <a href=\"/wiki/Inflection\" title=\"Inflection\">inflectional</a> systems, but inflectional endings do not break off to create new pronouns or prepositions.  \n</p><p>The unidirectionality hypothesis does not claim that linguistic change <i>will</i> occur in any particular instance, only that if it <i>does</i> occur, it will be in the direction of <a href=\"/wiki/Lexical_word\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Lexical word\">lexical word</a> to <a href=\"/wiki/Grammatical_word\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Grammatical word\">grammatical word</a> and not the other way around. \n</p><p>Certain schools of linguistics object to the unidirectionality hypothesis on theoretical grounds, believing that there should be no favoured direction in the evolution of grammatical forms, and have proposed numerous counter-examples. However, most of these proposals show a lack of understanding of the hypothesis or of the history of the languages in question, and are instead examples of <a href=\"/wiki/Lexicalisation\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Lexicalisation\">lexicalisation</a>. True counter-examples to unidirectionality appear to be rare and require unusual conditions.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"A_counter-example\">A counter-example</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Unidirectionality_hypothesis&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: A counter-example\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>One counter-example is the evolution of a new pronoun for \"we\" out of verbal conjugations in northern dialects of <a href=\"/wiki/Irish_language\" title=\"Irish language\">Irish Gaelic</a>. It's as if <a href=\"/wiki/Spanish_language\" title=\"Spanish language\">Spanish</a> <i>hablamos</i> (we speak) were reanalyzed as <i>habla mos,</i> with <i>mos</i> becoming a new pronoun \"we\" that replaced the existing pronoun <i>nosotros</i>. In Irish this required a rather special set of circumstances. \n</p><p>Unusually for a European language, Irish is verb-initial, as can be seen in phrases such as \n</p>\n<dl><dd><i>Chonaic m\u00e9 th\u00fa</i> \"I saw you\" (literally <i>saw I thee</i>).</dd></dl>\n<p>In <a href=\"/wiki/Old_Irish\" title=\"Old Irish\">Old Irish</a> the verb was inflected for person, as it still is in the south of Ireland. The verb 'to be' was inflected as follows: \n</p>\n<table class=\"wikitable\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<th><i>to be</i><br />(Old Irish)</th>\n<th>singular</th>\n<th>plural\n</th></tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>1</b></td>\n<td>at-to</td>\n<td>at-t\u00e1am\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>2</b></td>\n<td>at-tai</td>\n<td>at-t\u00e1aid\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>3</b></td>\n<td>at-t\u00e1</td>\n<td>at-t\u00e1at\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>With such a system, there was no need for pronouns except for emphasis, as is the case with <a href=\"/wiki/Spanish_language\" title=\"Spanish language\">Spanish</a> today. However, in the north of Ireland, the system eroded, and most of the inflectional endings disappeared. The use of the subject pronouns then became obligatory to disambiguate the person of the verb. A similar change has taken place in <a href=\"/wiki/French_language\" title=\"French language\">French</a>, where the loss of most of the verbal endings (in the spoken language at least) has meant that subject pronouns are now required. \n</p><p>The subject pronouns of modern Irish are the following:\n</p>\n<table class=\"wikitable\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<th>pronouns<br />(modern)</th>\n<th>singular</th>\n<th>plural\n</th></tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>1</b></td>\n<td>m\u00e9</td>\n<td>sinn\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>2</b></td>\n<td>t\u00fa</td>\n<td>sibh\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>3m<br />3f</b></td>\n<td>s\u00e9,<br />s\u00ed</td>\n<td>siad\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>These were added to the verb wherever the inflections had disappeared. Since the subject comes after the verb in Irish, the pronouns effectively replaced the old verbal endings: \n</p>\n<table class=\"wikitable\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<th><i>to be</i><br />(modern)</th>\n<th>singular</th>\n<th>plural\n</th></tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>1</b></td>\n<td>t\u00e1im <i>or</i><br />t\u00e1 m\u00e9</td>\n<td>t\u00e1imid\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>2</b></td>\n<td>t\u00e1 t\u00fa</td>\n<td>t\u00e1 sibh\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>3</b></td>\n<td>t\u00e1 s\u00e9,<br />t\u00e1 s\u00ed</td>\n<td>t\u00e1 siad\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>The first-person singular (\"I\") form is still retained in some areas but appears to be in the process of dropping out and being replaced by the pronoun <i>m\u00e9</i>. However, the first-person plural (\"we\") form&#8212;the only ending that was a complete syllable&#8212;is robust everywhere, and the pronoun <i>sinn</i> is not used in this situation. This happened not just with the verb 'to be' but with all Irish verbs. \n</p><p>The unidirectionality hypothesis would predict that this paradigm would either remain as it is, with the pronouns retaining their status as independent words, or else that they might fuse with the verb into a new verbal conjugational system, as existed in Old Irish. However, something more unusual occurred: the pronouns did retain their separate status, but the first-person plural verbal ending <i>-mid</i> was reanalyzed as a pronoun, by analogy with the other persons. Thus Irish has acquired a new pronoun for \"we\", <i>muid</i>, which can be used as an independent word, for example as an emphatic <i>muide</i> \"us\": If someone asks \"Who is there?\", an Irish speaker might reply, <i>Is muide</i> (\"It is us\"). This new pronoun appears to be replacing the original pronoun <i>sinn</i>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Unidirectionality_hypothesis&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><i>The Evolution of Grammar: Tense, aspect, and modality in the languages of the world.</i> Joan Bybee, Revere Perkins, &amp; William Pagliuca.
