Língua dos Pês (Portuguese, P Language) is a language game spoken in Brazil and Portugal with Portuguese. It is also known in other languages, such as Dutch. There are at least three different "dialects," or variations, of Língua do Pê. This "dialect" of Língua do Pê is just like the Jeringonza and the Idioma F language games in Spanish.  It works by repeating the rime of each syllable, beginning it with p (pê in Portuguese).  Examples: This "dialect" is like the one described above, except that some vowels are changed.  When an open syllable (one that ends in a vowel) has [o] or [e] as its vowel, it is changed to [ɔ] and [ɛ], respectively.  Please note that the syllables beginning with p are stressed, not the original syllables. This "dialect" is more like Kongarian (a language game spoken with Hungarian) than the other "dialects" of Língua do Pê.  To speak it, the syllable pê is inserted before every syllable. This is the variant most used in Brazilian Portuguese, while the others are more common in European Portuguese. In the Netherlands, the most common version is to instert the syllable "ep" before every sonant.
