Ubbi dubbi is a language game spoken with the English language, and is a close relative of the language game Obbish.  It was popularized by the 1970s PBS television show Zoom.  Variations to Ubbi Dubbi include Ob, Ib, Arpy Darpy, and  Iz. Ubbi dubbi works by adding -ub- /ʌb/ before each vowel sound in a syllable.  (A linguist would say "Insert [ˈʌb] after each syllable onset".)  The stress falls on the "ub" of the syllable that is stressed in the original word. So in "hello", which is stressed on the "he-" syllable, the stress falls on the "hub" in "hubellubo". Ubbi Dubbi has also been popularized as the signature speech pattern of the cartoon character Mushmouth from the animated series Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids, voiced by Bill Cosby. It was used in the episode "Mentalo Case" from the TV series The King Of Queens, between character Spence Olchin (Patton Oswalt) and a salesman at a toy convention. It was also used between Penny and Amy Farrah Fowler in  season 10 episode 7 of The Big Bang Theory as a means of having a secret conversation, to counter Sheldon and Leonard's Klingon. In the video game Rayman Origins, the Bubble Dreamer speaks Ubbi Dubbi.
