Before the beginnings of large-scale modern <a href=\"/wiki/Lexicography\" title=\"Lexicography\">lexicography</a> in the 16th century and the development of the <a href=\"/wiki/Comparative_method\" title=\"Comparative method\">comparative method</a> in the 18th, a scientific etymology as modern linguistics understand it was not possible.  However, grammarians had always speculated about the origins of words.  There are many examples of etymology in the Bible, for example, and in the works of classical writers.  In cases where the history of the words was simple, such speculations have sometimes proved correct in the light of modern scholarship, but generally they were based on superficial similarities.\n</p><p>Like classical etymology, Medieval Christian etymology drew tenuous connections between superficially similar words, but exegetical etymology was radically new in what it then did with the connections.  The purpose of etymology was to elucidate the spiritual background to a concept, drawing out aspects of semantics in a similar manner to the symbolic interpretation of the natural world.\n</p><p>An example: <a href=\"/wiki/Hugh_of_St_Victor\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hugh of St Victor\">Hugh of St Victor</a> derived the Latin word <i>mors</i> ('death') from <i>morsus</i> ('bite'): <i>a morsu primi hominis qui vetitae arboris pomum mordens mortem incurrit</i> ('from the bite of the first man, who, biting the apple of the forbidden tree, incurs death').<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>  The etymology was thus crafted to teach a spiritual truth.  The fact that the same author knew other, alternative and logically incompatible etymologies for the same word (<i>mors</i> comes also from <i>amarus</i>, 'bitter', or from the name of the god of war Mars) did not devalue the lesson, since it was the spiritual meaning and not the philological accuracy which stood in the foreground.\n</p><p>As yet there is still no satisfactory history of Christian etymology, but a very useful discussion of it is that of <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Friedrich_Ohly&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Friedrich Ohly (page does not exist)\">Friedrich Ohly</a> in his essay \"On the spiritual sense of the word in the Middle Ages\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\nOhly writes:\n</p>\n<dl><dd>It would be foolish to deride such an etymology as unscientific if it helped the people of its time to arrive at a deeper signification of the meaning of the word, since it was precisely the task of etymology at that time to illuminate the spiritual meaning of the word.  Our modern etymology would have appeared questionable to the Middle Ages, because it is bogged down in the literal meaning of the word and does not give any explanation of the meaning of the world or of life.  The spiritual meaning of the word with its universe of signification, and its scope of signification, contains an interpretation of meaning that derives from the Christian spirit and is thus a guide to life...<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup></dd></dl>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Notes\">Notes</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Medieval_etymology&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Notes\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">PL 177, 134C.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-2\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Friedrich Ohly, \"On the spiritual sense of the word in the Middle Ages\", in Ohly <i>Sensus Spiritualis: Studies in Medieval Significs and the Philology of Culture</i>, translated from German by Kenneth Northcott, University of Chicago Press 2005.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-3\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-3\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Ohly, \"Spiritual meaning\", p. 18.</span>\n</li>\n</ol></div></div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Medieval_etymology&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><i><a href=\"/wiki/Etymologiae\" title=\"Etymologiae\">Etymologiae</a></i></li>\n<li><i><a href=\"/wiki/Cratylus_(dialogue)\" title=\"Cratylus (dialogue)\">Cratylus</a></i></li></ul>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw1258\nCached time: 20180904123707\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.024 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.034 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 108/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 338/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 82/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 7/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 1019/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\nLua time usage: 0.003/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 525 KB/50 MB\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   18.341      1 Template:Reflist\n100.00%   18.341      1 -total\n 10.54%    1.933      1 Template:Main_other\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:7307026-0!canonical and timestamp 20180904123707 and revision id 788666429\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","*":"History_of_linguistics"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Etymology"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Comparative method"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Cratylus (dialogue)"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Etymologiae"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Etymology"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Hugh of St Victor"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Lexicography"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Middle Ages"},{"ns":0,"*":"Friedrich Ohly"}],"templates":[{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Reflist"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Main other"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Check for unknown parameters"}],"images":[],"externallinks":[],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Notes","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Medieval_etymology","byteoffset":3057,"anchor":"Notes"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"See also","number":"2","index":"2","fromtitle":"Medieval_etymology","byteoffset":3080,"anchor":"See_also"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Medieval etymology","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q6806844"}]}}
