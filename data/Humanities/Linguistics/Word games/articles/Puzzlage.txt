Puzzlage is a tabletop word search game that utilizes jigsaw puzzle pieces and a spinner.   Players create a word search puzzle by arranging lettered jigsaw puzzle pieces around a spinner. After spinning the spinner, they must point out a word using one of the letters the spinner lands on to stay in the game. Players can be voted out for taking too long and challenged on the meaning of a word.
