Play on Words is a word card game, in which players build words from 8 stacks of cards which show available letters. Players earn points by building words from the stacks or stealing opponents' words. Words can be captured if they are added to or rearranged to make a new word.  Play on Words was released by David James Games in 2014. Play on Words received a Parents' Choice Silver Honor Award in Fall of 2015. Play on Words can be played by 2 to 4 players (or up to 6 players in teams of 2.) The dealer lays out half of the 80 card deck in 8 stacks on the table top. Player one builds one word (2 letters or more) from the available letters and places it on his or her side of the table. Player two then flips over any cards needed to replenish the stacks to 8 available letters showing. Player two builds one word AND has the option of using any available letters to capture the opponent's word by "playing on" that word. A "play-on" consists of either adding to a word—or—adding to AND rearranging the letters to make a completely new word. Play then alternates back to player one. Play continues, with each player building at least one NEW word on their turn and having the option of capturing opponents' words by making "play-ons." When the stacks are gone, play ends and players count their points. Players receive one point per letter on their side of the table. The player with the most points wins that round. The game can be played in multiple rounds. Play on Words includes not only single letter cards, but word combo cards, "flip" cards (allowing players to choose a letter), and wild cards (for both vowels and consonants.) Play on Words is a handy game for home or travel. Only a tabletop is required. Valid words cannot be proper nouns, foreign words, profanity, or words with punctuation. Players score one point per letter of words on their side of the table, at end of game. The player with the most points wins that round.
