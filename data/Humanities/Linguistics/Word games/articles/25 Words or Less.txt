25 Words or Less is a party board game in which two teams of players take turns bidding words back and forth, until one team allows the other to try to give that number of clues to their team to try getting five words from a card in only one minute.  It was first published by Winning Moves Games USA in 1996 and was republished in 2006 as 25 Words or Less: People, Place and Things Edition. The game is no longer in production. The game is played by one player from each of the two teams drawing a card (1 between the two of them) and looking at the five words on the card.  They then begin bidding words, starting at 25 and working backward, until one player passes.  The player who passed then flips the timer and the other player has one minute to give clues to his team to try to get them to guess each of the five words on the card, where each word in the giver's clues counts as one of the words bid.  If the Giver manages to get his team to guess all five words, his team keeps the card.  If he runs out of time, the card passes to the other team.  Two new players from each team then start the next turn of bidding after looking at a new card.  The game ends once one team has collected ten cards. A game show version of this aired in Summer 2018 in syndication hosted by Meredith Vieira.
