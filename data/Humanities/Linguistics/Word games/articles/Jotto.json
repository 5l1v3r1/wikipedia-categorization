Words must appear in a dictionary; generally no <a href=\"/wiki/Proper_nouns\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Proper nouns\">proper nouns</a> are allowed. The object of the game is to correctly guess the other player's word first.\n</p><p>Players take turns: on a player's turn, they guess some five-letter word, and the other player announces how many letters in that guess match a unique letter in their secret word. For example, if the secret word is OTHER and the guess is PEACH, the E and H in PEACH match an E and an H in OTHER, so the announced result is \"2\". (Letters don't need to occur in the same position.) On the next turn, players reverse roles.\n</p><p>Players keep track on paper of each guess and result, crossing out letters of the alphabet that (by deduction) cannot appear in the opponent's secret word. Eventually one player has enough information to win by making a correct guess.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"History\">History</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Jotto&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: History\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Jotto was invented in 1955 by <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Morton_M._Rosenfeld&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Morton M.

Known to have been played with pencil and paper in <a href=\"/wiki/United_Kingdom\" title=\"United Kingdom\">UK</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Computer\" title=\"Computer\">computer</a> departments at least as far back as 1970. Each player picks a secret word of 6 letters, and they take turns guessing the other's word. Secret words (sometimes called 'targets') and guesses, must all be real words verifiable in a nominated dictionary. When you guess a word, you find out the number of letters which are perfect matches only.  So if you guess PEACHY and the secret word was OTHERS, you get a reply of 0 (because the E and H are in the wrong positions). Even more so than Jotto, this game stretches one's skills in combinatorial logic as well as one's command of the <a href=\"/wiki/Dictionary\" title=\"Dictionary\">dictionary</a>. The name of the same computer game is <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Sixicon&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Sixicon (page does not exist)\">Sixicon</a> by <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Island_Software&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Island Software (page does not exist)\">Island Software</a>, 1979.</li>\n<li><b>Five-Letter</b>, like Jotto, requires players to take turns guessing at an opponent's five-letter word. Like Six-Letter, responses only indicate the number of perfect matches. If you guess PEACH and the secret word is PHIAL, the response would be 1 -- the P is an exact match, but the A and the H are not. A strong strategy for Five-Letter involves attacking the middle three positions (2, 3, and 4) with vowels.</li>\n<li>The television game show <a href=\"/wiki/Lingo_(disambiguation)#Game_shows\" class=\"mw-redirect mw-disambig\" title=\"Lingo (disambiguation)\">Lingo</a> consists largely of contestants playing a variant of Jotto.  In Lingo,  the player is told which matching letters are in the correct position, and which are in incorrect positions.  Instead of being selected by the contestants, the words are chosen by the show and contestants are given a limited number of guesses.</li>\n<li><b>Kane Jotto</b> is a form of multi-player Jotto. Each player has a secret word, like the original game. Each round, a player guesses a word and each player goes around stating the number of letters his or her secret word has in common with the guess. The winner correctly guesses the secret words of all other players.</li>\n<li><b>Three-letter Jotto</b> is played without using pencil and paper. In order that the game not be overly difficult, as it must be done entirely in the head, only perfect matches return a count.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Jotto&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Bulls_and_Cows\" title=\"Bulls and Cows\">Bulls and Cows</a> \u2014 a similar game with numbers</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)\" title=\"Mastermind (board game)\">Mastermind</a> \u2014 a similar game with colored pegs</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"External_links\">External links</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Jotto&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: External links\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.panix.com/~sos/bc/jotto.html\">Jotto</a> &#8212; Detailed rules, strategies</li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://jotto.augiehill.com/\">Working version of Jotto</a> &#8212; Uses 5 letters with duplicates not allowed</li></ul>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw1275\nCached time: 20180903091234\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.016 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.017 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 29/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 0/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:227145-0!canonical and timestamp 20180903091234 and revision id 844771479\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","*":"Word_games"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Selchow_and_Righter_games"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Endless_Games_games"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Paper-and-pencil_games"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Bulls and Cows"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Computer"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Dictionary"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Lingo (disambiguation)"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Logic"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Mastermind (board game)"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Proper nouns"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Selchow and Righter"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"United Kingdom"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Word game"},{"ns":0,"*":"Morton M.
