Perquackey is a word game played with dice, produced by Cardinal Industries, Inc. of Long Island City, New York. It was previously produced by Lakeside Toys, a division of Lakeside Industries, Inc. of Minneapolis, Minnesota,   and originally by The Shreve Company of Los Angeles, California. It is similar to the 1956 game Spill & Spell.  The game is played with 10 black-lettered dice and three red-lettered dice. Each player, initially, rolls the 10 black-lettered dice. The player must rearrange them into as many words as possible within a certain time, reusing the letters repeatedly. Points are scored according to the length of each word and the number of words made. Once a player reaches 2,500 points, all 13 dice are used; all words must now contain at least four letters. A player with at least 2,500 points is considered "vulnerable"; at least 500 points must be scored in a turn, or 500 points are deducted from their score. The first player to reach 5,000 points is the winner. The dice are labeled as follows: In the Dick Van Dyke Show episode "A Man's Teeth Are Not His Own," Rob & Laura play a game of Perquackey with their neighbors. In the Three's Company episode "Critic's Choice," Mr. Furley bursts in to invite Janet and Terri to play a game of Perquackey. In the Blossom episode “I Ain’t Got No Buddy,” Blossom’s dad, Nick, threatens Blossom, Anthony, and Joey with a game of Perquackey if they don’t tell him what they’re hiding. In a Season 5 episode of “Maude”, Maude tells her Aunt Lola that their fun evening is to include a game of Perquackey with friends Arthur and Vivian. In the song "S&M", by Dean Friedman one of the choruses reads -  "Oo, Oo, Aha. Do it again, pretty momma. We'll buy ice-cream. I'll let you treat me. We'll play Perquacky. I'll let you beat me."
