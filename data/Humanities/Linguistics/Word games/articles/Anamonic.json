{"parse":{"title":"Anamonic","pageid":2228750,"revid":830509795,"text":{"*":"<div class=\"mw-parser-output\"><p>An <b>anamonic</b> is a form of <a href=\"/wiki/Mnemonic\" title=\"Mnemonic\">mnemonic</a> device frequently employed by tournament <a href=\"/wiki/Scrabble\" title=\"Scrabble\">Scrabble</a> players (the word <b>anamonic</b> is itself a <a href=\"/wiki/Portmanteau\" title=\"Portmanteau\">portmanteau</a> of <b>ana</b>gram and mne<b>monic</b>). It consists of a six or seven letter \"stem\" (often, but not always, an acceptable word itself), paired with a phrase in which each letter can be added to the stem and rearranged (anagrammed) to form a new word. Typical stems are sets of six or seven letters, as such anamonics aid in learning and in finding valuable seven- and eight-letter bingo (<a href=\"/wiki/British_English\" title=\"British English\">UK</a>: \"bonus\") plays. Just as importantly, a player can quickly verify that he or she should not waste valuable time looking for a word in a set of letters that is ruled out by an anamonic.\n</p><p>A successful anamonic will typically have some memorable semantic relationship to the stem.  It will usually avoid unnecessary or easily confused words, which might lead to a misconception of just which letters combine with the <a href=\"/wiki/Plant_stem\" title=\"Plant stem\">stem</a>.\n</p><p>When no vowel combines with the stem, an anamonic phrase will typically make use of multiple vowels that are meant to be ignored.  A skilled Scrabble player will typically be able to verify that at least one of these vowels does not form an acceptable word with the stem, thereby avoiding confusion.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Authorship\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Authorship\">Authorship</a> of particularly noteworthy anamonics is often acknowledged, although this is not necessarily expected by the Scrabble community.  \n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Example_anamonic_.28North_American_word_list.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Example_anamonic_(North_American_word_list)\">Example anamonic (North American word list)</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Anamonic&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Example anamonic (North American word list)\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>TSUNAMI: COASTAL HARM\n</p>\n<ul><li>TSUNAMI+C = TSUNAMIC</li>\n<li>TSUNAMI+O = MANITOUS TINAMOUS</li>\n<li>TSUNAMI+A = AMIANTUS</li>\n<li>TSUNAMI+S = TSUNAMIS</li>\n<li>TSUNAMI+T = ANTISMUT</li>\n<li>TSUNAMI+L = SIMULANT</li>\n<li>TSUNAMI+H = HUMANIST</li>\n<li>TSUNAMI+R = NATRIUMS NATURISM</li>\n<li>TSUNAMI+M = MANUMITS</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Origin_of_the_term\">Origin of the term</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Anamonic&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Origin of the term\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The term \"anamonics\" was coined in a private letter to Nick Ballard in 1993. The coiner was Bob Lipton, who was probably the first or second player in history to make extensive use of anamonics before they even had a name. Lipton's first anamonics were constructed in the summer of 1987. It was Ballard who first popularized the technique in a series of articles published in the now-defunct newsletter \"Medleys.\"\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"External_links\">External links</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Anamonic&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: External links\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.math.toronto.edu/jjchew/scrabble/anamonics-twl2.html\">Canonical List of Anamonics</a> (maintained by <a href=\"/wiki/John_Chew\" title=\"John Chew\">John Chew</a>)</li></ul>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw1273\nCached time: 20180911102300\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.004 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.010 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 15/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 0/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:2228750-0!canonical and timestamp 20180911102300 and revision id 830509795\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","*":"Scrabble"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Mnemonics"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Word_games"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Word_play"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Authorship"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"British English"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"John Chew"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Mnemonic"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Plant stem"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Portmanteau"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Scrabble"}],"templates":[],"images":[],"externallinks":["http://www.math.toronto.edu/jjchew/scrabble/anamonics-twl2.html"],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Example anamonic (North American word list)","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Anamonic","byteoffset":1452,"anchor":"Example_anamonic_(North_American_word_list)"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Origin of the term","number":"2","index":"2","fromtitle":"Anamonic","byteoffset":1741,"anchor":"Origin_of_the_term"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"External links","number":"3","index":"3","fromtitle":"Anamonic","byteoffset":2180,"anchor":"External_links"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Anamonic","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q4751206"}]}}
