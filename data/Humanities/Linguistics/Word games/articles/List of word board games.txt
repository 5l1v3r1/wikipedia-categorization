Word board games are those games played on a board as players of the game attempt to construct words that use a scoring system.  The player with the highest score wins the game.  Many if not most board games are also available as software programs and online.  Online word board games can be organized so that the player is playing against other people or the game can be played against an automated program acting as an artificial intelligence. Players of some word board games organize themselves into associations, clubs, and tournaments.   One essential skill for successful playing of board games is vocabulary development including the memorizing of two-letter English words.    List of world championships in mind sports
