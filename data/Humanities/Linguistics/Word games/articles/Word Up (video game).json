Each word scores points according to the letters used therein (sum of all letters) multiplied by the total number of letters in the word. points from all words entered are accumulated.\nHence the word LAVA would score <span class=\"texhtml\">(5 + 1 + 4 + 1) x 4 = 44</span>.\n</p><p>The hierarchy of letters is similar to that of <a href=\"/wiki/Scrabble\" title=\"Scrabble\">Scrabble</a>; Q and Z are the highest-scoring tiles (each 10) followed by X and J (each 8) and so on, the most notable variance is that here L is worth five as opposed to just one in Scrabble. The player starts with two minutes to find as many words as he can; if he manages to use Q, Z, X, or J in any word he is awarded a further 10 seconds. After each successful entry the letters used are discarded with the matrix replacing those letters used with surrounding tiles from above and to the left, a void is thus formed to the top left of the game screen. There is an additional 500 point bonus awarded for clearing the grids with allowable words.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"National_tournament_and_reissue_as_Word_Soup\">National tournament and reissue as Word Soup</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Word_Up_(video_game)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: National tournament and reissue as Word Soup\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>A tournament running on the <a href=\"/wiki/Itbox\" title=\"Itbox\">itbox</a> terminal ended on 22 April 2007.

The PC version is identical in almost every detail.  The only noticeable differences occur with the in-game dictionary and the length of each timed game (5 minutes as opposed to the 2 in Word Up).  While not offering exactly the same experience due to the aforementioned differences, the PC version does act as a useful (and free) training aid, allowing strategies and techniques to be honed.  The PC version is available online to download as a demo and can also be purchased ($20) for unrestricted play.  The demo has a 60-minute time limit.  The PC version also has two additional modes which the pub version does not (for obvious reasons) include; these are the <i>Brain Game</i> and the <i>Single Game</i>.  The Single Game works just as a normal Word Up game, except there is no time limit - this allows the grid to be studied in depth, allowing for long and complex word creation. The object of the Brain Game is to create a number of words to reach a point\u2019s target.  Once that target is reached then the length of the various words made is converted into new blocks (each 3 letter word = 1 block, each 4 letter word = 2 blocks etc.).  These new blocks are then added, a new points target is set and the game continues in this fashion until you have run out of blocks or cannot make any words with those left.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Xbox_360_version\">Xbox 360 version</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Word_Up_(video_game)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Xbox 360 version\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>On 19 November 2008 Word Soup was launched on the <a href=\"/wiki/Xbox_Live_Marketplace\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Xbox Live Marketplace\">Xbox 360 Community Games channel</a>.
