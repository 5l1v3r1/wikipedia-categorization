Kaladont or kalodont is a South Slavic word game, popular in Croatia, Serbia, Slovenia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, in which players in turn say words, each beginning with the last two letters of the previous word.  The name originates in the Kalodont toothpaste brand, which is a winning word, since there are no words in South Slavic languages that begin with nt. One of the players starts by speaking a word. Then, each following player in sequence (usually clockwise or counterclockwise) must come up with a word beginning with the last two letters of the previous word. The word must have at least four letters, must be in its standard form (i.e. infinitive for verbs, nominative for nouns, etc.) may not be made-up or a proper name, and no previous word may be repeated. When one of the players cannot come up with an acceptable word, he loses the game.   The winner is the player who posed the word with the difficult ending; he gets to start the next round.  If a player says a word ending with -ka, the first player to say kaladont is the winner.
