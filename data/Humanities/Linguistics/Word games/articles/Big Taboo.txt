Big Taboo is a variation on the classic board game Taboo. The game has added elements similar to games like Pictionary, Charades, and 25 Words or Less to create a fun party game with a 'little bit of everything'.  It was published by Winning Moves Games USA in 2008 and is no longer in production. The game starts by the players dividing into two teams.  Teams move a pawn around a track and must play a round of word guessing.  One person on the team gives clues to the other players on their team and they must get as many as they can in the time allowed.  The trick is that the method and rules a player uses to give clues is different depending on what space the team's pawn landed on.  On some spaces, clues are given using rules of the classic Taboo game.  On other spaces, clues are drawn, similar to Pictionary, or are limited to 15 words or must be given using "Bendy Bob," a small purple stuffed toy included with the game to act out the word(s). Once the guessing round is finished, teams move their pawn a number of spaces equal to the number of words they guessed correctly that turn.  The turn then passes to the other team. Play continues until one team reaches the last space on the track.
