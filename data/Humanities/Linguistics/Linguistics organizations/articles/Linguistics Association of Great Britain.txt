The Linguistics Association of Great Britain (LAGB) is an association which claims to be the leading professional association for academic linguists there.  The association's predecessor was the Germanist Jeffrey Ellis' Linguistic Circle at Hull University which became active in the late 1950s.  It was renamed LAGB and had its first meeting of significance on 1 November 1959.   The association has published the Journal of Linguistics since 1964.
