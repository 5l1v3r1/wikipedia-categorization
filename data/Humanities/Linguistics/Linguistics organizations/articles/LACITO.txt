LACITO (Langues et Civilisations à Tradition Orale) is a multidisciplinary research organisation, principally devoted to the study of cultures and languages of oral tradition.  LACITO is a branch of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), the principal network of researchers in France. It is thus occasionally referred to as LACITO–CNRS or CNRS–LACITO. Created in 1976 by André-Georges Haudricourt, LACITO is specialized in the description, documentation and analysis of under-documented languages of the world.
