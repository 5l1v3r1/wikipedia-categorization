All natural languages are of relevance to this study. The center has been exploring a methodology which can be referred to as \"Selective Global Comparison,\" an approach in which a relatively small number of unrelated languages are examined in depth in order to determine the nature of the variation which distinguishes them. This methodology is distinct from usual work in <a href=\"/wiki/Linguistic_typology\" title=\"Linguistic typology\">linguistic typology</a>, which tends to compare many languages at a relatively superficial level of description, and from microcomparative studies, which tend to compare closely related languages at a level of great detail.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Organizational_structure\">Organizational structure</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Center_for_Advanced_Study_in_Theoretical_Linguistics&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Organizational structure\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>At any given time there are about twenty to twenty-five doctorate holding linguists working on CASTL-related projects in Troms\u00f8. There are also twelve to fifteen PhD students and some number of Master's students. In addition, CASTL is the center of a broad international network of current linguistic research, for example as the administrative host of the NORMS project (a Nordic Center of Excellence in Microcomparative Scandinavian Syntax) and the EGG school and other international ventures. It is therefore one of the largest centers dedicated to theoretical linguistic research in the world.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Recent_Research\">Recent Research</span><span
