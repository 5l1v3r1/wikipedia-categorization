The International Speech Communication Association (ISCA) is a non-profit organization and one of the two main professional associations for speech communication science and technology, the other association being the IEEE Signal Processing Society. The purpose is to promote the study and application of automatic speech processing (in the two directions: speech recognition and speech synthesis) with several sub-topics like speaker recognition or speech compression. The activity of the association concerns all aspects of speech processing, from the computational aspects to the linguistic aspects as well as the theorical aspects. ISCA organizes yearly the INTERSPEECH conference. Most recent INTERSPEECH: Forthcoming INTERSPEECH: Current ISCA president is John Hansen. Vice president is Torbj√∏rn Svendsen. The other members are professionals of the field.  ISCA is the result of the merge of ESCA (European Speech Communication Association created in 1987 in Europe) and PC-ICSLP (Permanent Council of the organization of International Conference on Spoken Language Processing created in 1986 in Japan). The first ISCA event was held in 2000 in Beijing, China.
