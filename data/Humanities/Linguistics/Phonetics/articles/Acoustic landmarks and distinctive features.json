Stevens\">Kenneth N. Stevens</a> and his colleagues at <a href=\"/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_Of_Technology\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Massachusetts Institute Of Technology\">MIT</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Model\">Model</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Acoustic_landmarks_and_distinctive_features&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Model\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In this model, the incoming acoustic signal is believed to be first processed to determine the so-called landmarks which are special <a href=\"/wiki/Frequency_spectrum\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Frequency spectrum\">spectral</a> events in the signal; for example, vowels are typically marked by higher frequency of the first formant, consonants can be specified as discontinuities in the signal and have lower amplitudes in lower and middle regions of the spectrum. These acoustic features result from articulation. In fact, secondary articulatory movements may be used when enhancement of the landmarks is needed due to external conditions such as noise. Stevens claims that <a href=\"/wiki/Coarticulation\" title=\"Coarticulation\">coarticulation</a> causes only limited and moreover systematic and thus predictable variation in the signal which the listener is able to deal with. Within this model therefore, what is called the <a href=\"/wiki/Speech_perception#Lack_of_invariance\" title=\"Speech perception\">lack of invariance</a> is simply claimed not to exist.\n</p><p>Landmarks are analyzed to determine certain articulatory events (gestures) which are connected with them. In the next stage, acoustic cues are extracted from the signal in the vicinity of the landmarks by means of mental measuring of certain parameters such as frequencies of spectral peaks, amplitudes in low-frequency region, or timing.\n</p><p>The next processing stage comprises acoustic-cues consolidation and derivation of distinctive features. These are binary categories related to articulation (for example [+/- high], [+/- back], [+/- round lips] for vowels; [+/- sonorant], [+/- lateral], or [+/- nasal] for consonants.\n</p><p>Bundles of these features uniquely identify speech segments (phonemes, syllables, words). These segments are part of the lexicon stored in the listener\u2019s memory. Its units are activated in the process of lexical access and mapped on the original signal to find out whether they match. If not, another attempt with a different candidate pattern is made. In this iterative fashion, listeners thus reconstruct the articulatory events which were necessary to produce the perceived speech signal. This can be therefore described as analysis-by-synthesis.\n</p><p>This theory thus posits that the <a href=\"/wiki/Perception#Terminology\" title=\"Perception\">distal object</a> of speech perception are the articulatory gestures underlying speech. Listeners make sense of the speech signal by referring to them. The model belongs to those referred to as analysis-by-synthesis.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Bibliography\">Bibliography</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Acoustic_landmarks_and_distinctive_features&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Bibliography\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><cite class=\"citation book\">Hayward, Katrina (2000). <i>Experimental Phonetics: An Introduction</i>.
