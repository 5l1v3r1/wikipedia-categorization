In Latin and Greek poetry, correption (/kəˈrɛpʃən/; Latin: correptiō [korˈreptɪoː], "a shortening")   is the shortening of a long vowel at the end of one word before a short vowel at the beginning of the next.   Vowels next to each other in neighboring words are in hiatus. Homer uses correption in dactylic hexameter: Here the sequence η ε in bold must be pronounced as ε ε to preserve the long—short—short syllable weight sequence of a dactyl. Thus, the scansion of the second line is thus: πλαγχ θε, ε | πει Τρο ι | η ςι ε | ρον πτο λι | εθ ρο νε | περ σε Typically, in Homeric meter, a syllable is scanned long or "closed" when a vowel is followed by two or more consonants. However, in Attic Greek, a short vowel followed by a plosive and a liquid consonant or nasal stop remains a short or "open" syllable.   This is called Attic Correption. Therefore, the first syllable of a word like δάκρυ (ᾰ) could be scanned as "δά | κρυ" (open/short), exhibiting Attic correption, or as "δάκ | ρυ" (closed/long), in keeping with the conventions of Homeric verse.
