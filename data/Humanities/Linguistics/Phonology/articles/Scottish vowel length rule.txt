The Scottish vowel length rule (also known as Aitken's law after A. J. Aitken, the Scottish linguist who formulated it) describes how vowel length in Scots, Scottish English, and, to some extent, Mid-Ulster English  is conditioned by the phonetic environment of the target vowel. Certain vowels are long before /r/, voiced fricatives or a morpheme boundary. Also, vowels in word-final open syllables are long. The underlying phonemes of the Scottish vowel system are as follows:  The Scottish vowel length rule affects all vowels except 15 and 19 and, in many Modern Scots varieties, vowels 8 and 12.  The further north a Scots dialect is from central Scotland, the more it will contain specific words that do not adhere to the rule.  The Scottish Vowel Length Rule is assumed to have come into being between the early Middle Scots and late Middle Scots period.
