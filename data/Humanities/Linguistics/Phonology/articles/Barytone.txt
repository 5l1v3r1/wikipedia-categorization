In Ancient Greek grammar, a barytone is a word without any accent on the last syllable. Words with an acute or circumflex on the second-to-last or third-from-last syllable are barytones, as well as words with no accent on any syllable: Like the word baritone, it comes from Ancient Greek barýtonos,  from barýs "heavy", "low"  and tónos "pitch", "sound".
