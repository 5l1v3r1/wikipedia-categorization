Prodelision is a form of elision in which the latter word loses its first vowels. Example: "Namqu(e) etsi nullum memorabile nomen femina(e) in poena (e)st, habet haec victoria laudem, exstinxisse nefas." (Aeneid 2.583-585) The "e" of "est" elides in the second line, rather than the "a" of "poena."  This is very common in Latin with forms of the verb "esse."
