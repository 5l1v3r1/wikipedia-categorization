This is primarily a <a href=\"/wiki/Psychoacoustics\" title=\"Psychoacoustics\">perceptual</a> classification, based on whether the sounds are perceived as sharp, high <a href=\"/wiki/Sound_intensity\" title=\"Sound intensity\">intensity</a>, or as dull, low <a href=\"/wiki/Sound_intensity\" title=\"Sound intensity\">intensity</a>.  However, it can also be defined acoustically (acute sounds have a concentration of energy in the higher spectrum, versus graves which have a concentration of energy in the lower spectrum) or in terms of the <a href=\"/wiki/Articulation_(phonetics)\" title=\"Articulation (phonetics)\">articulations</a> involved.\n</p><p><b>Acute</b> sounds generally have high perceptual intensity, and in the case of consonants have been defined as those with an <a href=\"/wiki/Active_articulator\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Active articulator\">active articulation</a> involving the tongue and a <a href=\"/wiki/Passive_articulator\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Passive articulator\">passive articulation</a> involving anywhere on the roof of the mouth that a <a href=\"/wiki/Coronal_consonant\" title=\"Coronal consonant\">coronal articulation</a> can reach, that is, from the <a href=\"/wiki/Dental_consonant\" title=\"Dental consonant\">dental</a> to the <a href=\"/wiki/Palatal_consonant\" title=\"Palatal consonant\">palatal</a> region.  \n</p><p><b>Grave</b> sounds are all other sounds, that is, those involving the lips as either passive or active articulator, or those involving any articulation in the <a href=\"/wiki/Soft_palate\" title=\"Soft palate\">soft palate</a> or throat.\n</p><p>Most acute sounds are <a href=\"/wiki/Coronal_consonant\" title=\"Coronal consonant\">coronal</a>, and most coronals are acute.  In particular, <a href=\"/wiki/Palatal_consonant\" title=\"Palatal consonant\">palatal consonants</a> are acute but not coronal, while <a href=\"/wiki/Linguolabial_consonant\" title=\"Linguolabial consonant\">linguolabial consonants</a> are coronal but not acute.  The distinction can be useful in <a href=\"/wiki/Diachronic_linguistics\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Diachronic linguistics\">diachronic linguistics</a>, as conditional sound changes often act differently on acute and grave consonants, consonants are highly likely to preserve their acuteness/graveness through sound change; and changes between acute and grave can often be well circumscribed. (For example, palatalization applied to back grave consonants usually produces acute consonants.)  In this regard, the fact that <a href=\"/wiki/Palatal_consonant\" title=\"Palatal consonant\">palatal</a> articulations are included as \"acute\" is important because of the acoustic similarity between true palatal and <a href=\"/wiki/Palatalization_(phonetics)\" title=\"Palatalization (phonetics)\">palatalized</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Coronal_consonant\" title=\"Coronal consonant\">coronal consonants</a> and the fact that one often changes into the other. \n</p><p>Similarly, \"acute\" and \"<a href=\"/wiki/Front_consonant\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Front consonant\">front</a>\" often overlap, but again share some differences.  In particular, consonants articulated with the lip are front but not acute, and consonants with a <a href=\"/wiki/Palatal_consonant\" title=\"Palatal consonant\">palatal</a> articulation are acute but not front. A parallel relationship applies to <a href=\"/wiki/Coronal_consonant\" title=\"Coronal consonant\">coronal</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Front_consonant\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Front consonant\">front</a>.  Articulations with the lip as <a href=\"/wiki/Passive_articulator\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Passive articulator\">passive articulator</a> (i.e. <a href=\"/wiki/Labial_consonant\" title=\"Labial consonant\">labial</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Labiodental_consonant\" title=\"Labiodental consonant\">labiodental</a>) are front but not coronal, while <a href=\"/wiki/Subapical_consonant\" title=\"Subapical consonant\">subapical</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Palatal_consonant\" title=\"Palatal consonant\">palatal</a> is coronal but not front. \n</p><p>In the case of vowels, \"acute\" typically refers to <a href=\"/wiki/Front_vowel\" title=\"Front vowel\">front vowels</a>, which often trigger palatalization of consonants, which \"grave\" refers to non-front vowels.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Modern_relevance\">Modern relevance</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Grave_and_acute&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Modern relevance\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The grave/acute distinction has lost its relevance in modern phonetics, bur it may still be relevant to other disciplines. The distinction dates from relatively early in the days of acoustic phonetics, at a time that some phonologists believed that one could categorize all speech sounds by a finite set of acoustically-defined distinctive features, which were supposed to correspond to auditory impressions of sounds. The pioneering publication was Jakobson, Fant and Halle (1951) <i>Preliminaries to Speech Analysis</i> (MIT). Grave/acute was defined primarily in acoustic terms (with some reference to auditory qualities), but sounds were given a secondary description (or gloss) in terms of their articulation. Features like grave/acute could be used to divide speech sounds into broad classes. For most phoneticians, the JF&amp;H features had been superseded by 1968 by the articulatory features set out in Chomsky and Halle\u2019s <i>Sound Pattern of English</i> and by competing articulatory features, which devised by Ladefoged in such publications as <i>Preliminaries to Linguistic Phonetics</i> (1971).\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Grave_and_acute&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li>Jacobson, Roman; <i>On Language.</i> <a href=\"/wiki/Harvard_University_Press\" title=\"Harvard University Press\">Harvard University Press</a>, 1990 p.&#160;260</li></ul>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw1262\nCached time: 20180907173550\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.040 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.051 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 192/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 929/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 175/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 3/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 1/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\nLua time usage: 0.010/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 706 KB/50 MB\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   36.907      1 -total\n 76.20%   28.125      1 Template:For\n 13.50%    4.982      1 Template:See_also\n  8.34%    3.078     11 Template:Lcons\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:12256272-0!canonical and timestamp 20180907173550 and revision id 812760675\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","*":"Phonology"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Active articulator"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Acute accent"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Articulation (phonetics)"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Coronal consonant"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Dental consonant"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Diachronic linguistics"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Front and back (phonetics)"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Front consonant"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Front vowel"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Grave accent"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Harvard University Press"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Labial consonant"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Labiodental consonant"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Linguolabial consonant"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Palatal consonant"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Palatalization (phonetics)"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Passive articulator"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Phonetics"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Psychoacoustics"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Soft palate"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Sound intensity"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Subapical consonant"}],"templates":[{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:For"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:See also"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Lcons"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:For"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Hatnote list"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Hatnote"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Yesno"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Arguments"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Labelled list hatnote"}],"images":[],"externallinks":[],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Modern relevance","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Grave_and_acute","byteoffset":2808,"anchor":"Modern_relevance"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"References","number":"2","index":"2","fromtitle":"Grave_and_acute","byteoffset":4152,"anchor":"References"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Grave and acute","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q5597801"}]}}
