In phonology, apocope (/əˈpɒkəpiː/  ) is the loss (elision) of one or more sounds from the end of a word, especially the loss of an unstressed vowel. Apocope comes from the Greek ἀποκοπή (apokopḗ) from ἀποκόπτειν (apokóptein) "cutting off", from ἀπο- (apo-) "away from" and κόπτειν (kóptein) "to cut". In historical linguistics, apocope is often the loss of an unstressed vowel. In Estonian and the Sami languages, apocopes explain the forms of grammatical cases. For example, a nominative is described as having apocope of the final vowel, but the genitive does not. Throughout its history, however, the genitive case marker has also undergone apocope: Estonian linn ("a city") and linna ("of a city") are derived from linna and linnan respectively, as can still be seen in the corresponding Finnish word. In the genitive form, the final /n/, while it was being deleted, blocked the loss of /a/. In colloquial Finnish, the final vowel is sometimes omitted from case markers. Some languages have apocopations that are internalized as mandatory forms. In Spanish and Italian, for example, some adjectives that come before the noun lose the final vowel or syllable if they precede a noun (mainly) in the masculine singular form. In Spanish, some adverbs and cardinal and ordinal numbers have apocopations as well. Various numerous sorts of informal abbreviations might be classed as apocope: For a list of similar apocopations in the English language, see List of English apocopations. Diminutives in Australian English lists many apocopations. The process is also linguistically subsumed under one called clipping, or truncation.
