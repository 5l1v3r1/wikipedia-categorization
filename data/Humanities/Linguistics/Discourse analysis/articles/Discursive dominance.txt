The word discursive is closely related to the word discourse, which refers to "communication of ideas". In a society there are competing discourses (or narratives) regarding anything and everything such as feminism, racism, casteism, communalism, regionalism, economic development, democracy, governance, etc. These competing discourses struggle for dominance. Ultimately, one of the discourse emerges as dominant. This is known as discursive dominance. If none of the competing discourses manages to establish itself in the psyche of the people, it results in discord. A dominant discourse is a winning discursive formation. It is the one that survives the widest range of criticisms in various forums and media.
