The accusative absolute is a grammatical construction found in some languages.  It is an absolute construction found in the accusative case. In ancient Greek, the accusative case is used adverbially with participles of impersonal verbs. It is similar in usage to the genitive absolute.  For example: In German, a noun phrase can be put in the accusative to indicate that the subject of the sentence has the property described.  For example: The accusative absolute is sometimes found in place of the ablative absolute in the Latin of Late Antiquity as, for example, in the writings of Gregory of Tours and Jordanes. This likely arose when the pronunciation of the ablative and accusative singulars merged, since the final -m of the accusative singular was no longer pronounced, even in the Classical era. But the accusative absolute is also found with plural nouns where the ablative and accusative are not similar in pronunciation.
