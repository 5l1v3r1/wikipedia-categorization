The collective singular is a grammatical term for using the singular verb form with a collective noun. In other words, groups are referred to as one entity rather than as a collection of individuals. This rule is standard in the United States, but uncommon in the UK.  This does not, however, affect the tense later in the sentence. Exceptions to the rule[which?] include singular group names preceded by an article. This exception does not apply to artists whose name is preceded by an article, but ends in a singular. Abbreviations provide other "exceptions" in American usage concerning plurals. When only the name is plural but not the object, place, or person.
