Lexicogrammar is a term peculiar to systemic functional linguistics. It was coined by Michael Halliday, the father of systemic functional linguistics, to describe the continuity between grammar and lexis.  For many linguists, these phenomena are discrete. But Halliday brings them together with this term. As with other dimensions of Halliday's theory, he describes the relation of grammar to lexis as one of a 'cline', and therefore, one of 'delicacy'. In 1961, he wrote 'The grammarian's dream is...to turn the whole of linguistic form into grammar, hoping to show that lexis can be defined as "most delicate grammar".  In 1987, Ruqaiya Hasan wrote an article titled 'The grammarian's dream: lexis as delicate grammar',  in which she laid out a methodology for mapping lexis in Halliday's terms.
