 The following is a partial list of linguistic example sentences illustrating various linguistic phenomena. Different types of ambiguity which are possible in language. Demonstrations of words which have multiple meanings dependent on context. Demonstrations of ambiguity between alternative syntactic structures underlying a sentence. Demonstrations of how incremental and (at least partially) local syntactic parsing leads to infelicitous constructions and interpretations. This adjectival order is an example of the "Royal Order of Adjectives".  Some prescriptive grammar prohibits "preposition stranding": ending sentences with prepositions.  Sentences with unexpected endings. Demonstrations of sentences which are unlikely to have ever been said, although the combinatorial complexity of the linguistic system makes them possible. Demonstrations of sentences where the semantic interpretation is bound to context or knowledge of the world. Conditionals where the prejacent ("if" clause) is not strictly required for the consequent to be true.
