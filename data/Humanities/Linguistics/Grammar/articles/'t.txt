In the Dutch language, the word 't (Dutch pronunciation: [ət]) is a contraction of the article "het", meaning "the". 't can be found as a tussenvoegsel, a word that is positioned between a person's first and last name. Careful writers should use a right (closing) quotation mark (U+2019 ’ ) in front of the t – and not confuse it with a left quotation mark (U+2018 ‘ ).
