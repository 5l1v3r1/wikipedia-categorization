In linguistics, clitic doubling, or pronominal reduplication is a phenomenon by which clitic pronouns appear in verb phrases together with the full noun phrases that they refer to (as opposed to the cases where such pronouns and full noun phrases are in complementary distribution). Clitic doubling is found in many languages, including Albanian, Aromanian, Macedonian, Bulgarian, Degema, Greek, Persian, Romanian, Somali, Italian, and Spanish. The conditions on clitic doubling vary from language to language, generally depending on well-known properties of the objects along the animacy hierarchy (allowing, requiring, or forbidding clitic-doubling for different kinds of objects). In this regard, clitic doubling for objects can be viewed as a species of differential object marking. Spanish is one well-known example of a clitic-doubling language, having clitic doubling for both direct and indirect objects. Because standard Spanish grammatical structure does not draw a clear distinction between an indirect object and a direct object referring to a person or another animate entity (see Spanish prepositions), it is common but not compulsory to use clitic doubling to clarify. Compare: In such constructions, the indirect object can be expressed both as a full noun phrase and as a clitic in order to note that the noun phrase beginning with a (to) should be understood as an indirect object: The above, if literally translated into English, would be redundant: This usage is highly preferred for many verbs, but for some verbs it is not compulsory, and it would also be valid to say: "Siempre ofrezco café a mis invitados", without clitic doubling. Similarly, the direct object may also be doubled, with both the direct object pronoun and the full noun phrase, but this is not as common as indirect clitic doubling and is usually influenced by definiteness, animacy, and specificity. One particular use is to clarify emphatic structures: In Italian, clitic doubling is used as colloquial pleonasm, although it is considered incorrect by some.  Example: a me mi pare di sì ("I [personally, for what I am concerned] think so") In Iloko, a third person pronoun must co-occur with the full noun phrase to which it refers when 1) the noun phrase is the agent of a transitive verb and a pronoun is the patient, or when 2) the noun phrase is the possessor and a pronoun is the thing possessed. The appropriate fused personal pronoun is used and the number of its third person component must agree with the noun phrase. Examples: NOT: *Nakitaak ni Maria. NOT: *Nakitaak da Maria ken ni Juan. NOT: *Anakka dagiti Rizal. In Lombard, clitics are widely used with both nouns and pronouns. Te gh'el diset ti a la Rina che l'è staa luu? Will you tell OR Would you mind telling Rina it was him [who did it]? In Venetian, clitics usually double the second singular person subject and third singular and plural subject. The above, if literally translated into English, would be redundant: 'My parents come tomorrow' 'Marco comes tomorrow' 'You come tomorrow' Interrogative subjects clitics double also other subjects. They attach to the verb: 'Do you (pl.) sing as well?' Accusative clitics double first and second singular/plural direct object In some varieties of the language, also dative clitics may double and indirect object, even of third person: In the standard Macedonian language, clitic doubling is obligatory with definite direct and indirect objects, which contrasts with standard Bulgarian where clitic doubling is optional. Non-standard dialects of Macedonian and Bulgarian have differing rules regarding clitic doubling.  Clitic doubling occurs in Degema, as it does in Romance and Slavic languages. However, clitic doubling in Degema is not associated with the presence of a preposition as in Romance languages like Spanish nor is it associated with topicality or specificity as in Slavic languages like Bulgarian. Rather, what make clitic doubling in Degema possible are syntactic (movement and anaphoricity) and discourse (emphasis and/or familiarity) factors (Kari 2003)  Consider (1) below: (1) Eni      mo=sire In (1) the subject noun phrase (NP) 'Eni' is doubled by the clitic 'mo='. The clitic agrees in person, number and case with the doubled subject NP. Example (2) shows that specific and non-specific subjects in Degema can be doubled by a clitic: (2) Eni      mo=rere                  (non-specific) Example (3) shows that both topicalized and non-topicalized NPs in Degema can be doubled by a clitic: (3) Okper o=kun              esen                (non-topicalized) In Degema, the preposition does not feature in clitic doubling constructions in particular and in cliticization in general. Although there are object NPs such as indirect object NPs that can cooccur with a preposition, there are no corresponding object clitics to double them, unlike subject NPs. Kari (2003: 135f) adds that "syntactic factors are stronger than discourse factors in the licensing of clitic doubling in Degema.  Discourse factors only ensure the expression or suppression of the doubled NP after syntactic operations have taken place".
