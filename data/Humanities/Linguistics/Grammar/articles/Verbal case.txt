In grammar, the term verbal case has been used with various meanings.  It is frequently remarked that the genitive case behaves differently than other cases: Most cases (sometimes 'verbal' cases) are governed by their role in the clause relative to the verb, whereas the genitive (a 'nominal' case) is governed by another noun. For instance, the difference in English between nominative "I" and oblique "me" is governed by its relationship to the verb (at least according to prescriptive grammars), whereas the genitive form "my" is associated with a noun: I see the dog, the dog sees me, but my dog. There are other situations where a case has been argued to be nominal rather than verbal. For instance, in Latin, a noun may be inflected for case according to its role with an infinitive, which is arguably as much a noun as a verb, and this has been called nominal case:  Similarly, when a verb is nominalized, its arguments may remain with their original cases: Here, as the verb 'likes' is changed to the gerund 'liking', and the nominative 'she' changes to genitive 'her', but the oblique case of 'me' remains. Such situations are very common in subordinate clauses.
