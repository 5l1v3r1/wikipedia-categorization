In English grammar, a false singular occurs when a singular noun ending in a s or z sound is understood as a plural from which a new singular is constructed.  The false singular is a form of back-formation. Some false singulars become standard English.  For example, pea was originally a false singular from pease pl. peasen.  (The old word remains in the phrase pease porridge.) The non-standard historical forms Chinee and Portuguee are also false singulars, from Chinese and Portuguese.
