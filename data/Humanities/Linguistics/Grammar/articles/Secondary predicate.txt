A secondary predicate is a (mostly adjectival) predicative expression that conveys information about the subject or the object but is not the main predicate of the clause. This structure may be analysed in many different ways. These may be resultative, as in (1) and (2) or descriptive (also called "depictive") as in (3). Optional depictive secondary predicates are viewed as "predicative adjuncts" by some linguists. (Huddleston & Pullum 2002)
