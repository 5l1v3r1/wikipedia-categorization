class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>By 1901, the long debate known as the <a href=\"/wiki/Greek_language_question\" title=\"Greek language question\">Greek language question</a> had been underway for 135 years. Initial hopes that <a href=\"/wiki/Ancient_Greek_language\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Ancient Greek language\">Ancient Greek</a> itself could be revived as the language of the <a href=\"/wiki/Greek_War_of_Independence\" title=\"Greek War of Independence\">newly liberated</a> Greek nation had proved illusory; modern <a href=\"/wiki/Demotic_Greek\" title=\"Demotic Greek\">spoken or \"demotic\" Greek</a> had evolved far from its ancient roots, and the two languages were now mutually incomprehensible.\n</p><p>As a compromise, a grammatically simplified version of Ancient Greek known as <a href=\"/wiki/Katharevousa\" title=\"Katharevousa\"><i>katharevousa glossa</i></a> (\"language that tends towards purity\") had been adopted as the written language of the new state in 1830. This meant that the spoken and written languages were now intentionally different. It was hoped that written <i>katharevousa</i> would provide a model for imitation, and that spoken Greek would naturally \"purify\" itself by becoming more like this written form, and therefore more like Ancient Greek, within a matter of decades. To provide additional motivation, the current spoken or <a href=\"/wiki/Demotic_Greek\" title=\"Demotic Greek\">demotic Greek</a> was widely condemned as \"base\" and \"vulgar\", the damaged product of centuries of linguistic corruption by subjection to <a href=\"/wiki/Ottoman_Empire\" title=\"Ottoman Empire\">Ottoman</a> \"Oriental despotism\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-Mackridge_2009_3-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Mackridge_2009-3\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">:<span>90, 111\u201325, 159\u201367</span></sup>\n</p><p>After 50 years, spoken demotic still showed no sign of becoming \"purified\" into something more like Ancient Greek. On the other hand, <i>katharevousa</i> was proving unsatisfactory in use as a general-purpose written language. Scholars could not agree on its grammatical rules; and as a purely written language with no native speakers, it could not evolve a natural grammar of its own. Its Ancient Greek vocabulary could not be used to write about the objects and events of ordinary life without sounding stilted and unnatural.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Mackridge_2009_3-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Mackridge_2009-3\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">:<span>183\u20136, 210\u201311, 232</span></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Ancient_Greek_in_schools\">Ancient Greek in schools</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Gospel_riots&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Ancient Greek in schools\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The problem was compounded by the educational system. Until 1881 only Ancient Greek \u2014 not even <i>katharevousa</i> \u2014 was taught in Greek primary schools, continuing the tradition of the <a href=\"/wiki/Greek_Orthodox_Church\" title=\"Greek Orthodox Church\">Greek Orthodox Church</a>, which had exercised an effective monopoly over education for centuries (the Church had always taught the ancient <i><a href=\"/wiki/Koine_Greek\" title=\"Koine Greek\">koine</a></i> Greek of the gospels and the <a href=\"/wiki/Divine_Liturgy\" title=\"Divine Liturgy\">Divine Liturgy</a>). The children thus had to learn to read and write in a language they did not speak, or even hear outside church. This had been acceptable in previous centuries, when the schools had concentrated on training future priests; but it could not provide universal popular literacy.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Mackridge_2009_3-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Mackridge_2009-3\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">:<span>162\u20133, 187, 209</span></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Demotic_renaissance\">Demotic renaissance</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Gospel_riots&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Demotic renaissance\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>By 1880, many were beginning to feel that <i>katharevousa</i> had outlived its usefulness.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Mackridge_2009_3-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Mackridge_2009-3\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">:<span>199\u2013201</span></sup> <a href=\"/wiki/Kostis_Palamas\" title=\"Kostis Palamas\">Kostis Palamas</a> led the <a href=\"/wiki/New_Athenian_School\" title=\"New Athenian School\">New Athenian School</a> in a renaissance of demotic poetry; <a href=\"/wiki/Emmanuel_Rhoides\" title=\"Emmanuel Rhoides\">Ro\u00efdis</a> pinpointed the deficiencies of <i>katharevousa</i>, and coined the word <i><a href=\"/wiki/Diglossia\" title=\"Diglossia\">diglossia</a></i> to describe the unhealthy split between the spoken and written languages; and finally, in 1888, <a href=\"/wiki/Ioannis_Psycharis\" title=\"Ioannis Psycharis\">Ioannis Psycharis</a> published <i><a href=\"/wiki/Greek_language_question#My_Journey\" title=\"Greek language question\">My Journey</a></i>, which transformed the language debate.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Mackridge_2009_3-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Mackridge_2009-3\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">:<span>203\u20139, 232, 27\u201331, 215</span></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Psycharis_and_My_Journey\">Psycharis and <i>My Journey</i></span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Gospel_riots&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Psycharis and My Journey\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Psycharis proposed the immediate abandonment of <i>katharevousa</i> and the adoption of demotic for all written purposes.  But he did not reject the relationship with Ancient Greek; on the contrary, as an evolutionary linguist, he argued that spoken demotic really was Ancient Greek, merely two thousand years further along in its evolutionary history. As a <a href=\"/wiki/Neogrammarian\" title=\"Neogrammarian\">Neogrammarian</a>, he believed that the essence of language was passed on by speech rather than writing, and he regarded <i>katharevousa</i> as an artificial construct rather than a true language.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Mackridge_2009_3-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Mackridge_2009-3\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">:<span>215\u2013240</span></sup>\n</p><p>Many agreed with him up to this point. But Psycharis went further. If demotic were to be used as the written language of a modern state, it would need a larger technical <a href=\"/wiki/Vocabulary\" title=\"Vocabulary\">vocabulary</a>. Educated everyday speech in the 1880s simply borrowed such terms from written <i>katharevousa</i> (for example: the word <span lang=\"grc\" title=\"Ancient Greek language text\">\u1f10\u03be\u03ad\u03bb\u03b9\u03be\u03b9\u03c2</span>, \"evolution\", was altered to <span lang=\"grc\" title=\"Ancient Greek language text\">\u1f10\u03be\u03ad\u03bb\u03b9\u03be\u03b7</span> to conform to the <a href=\"/wiki/Morphology_(linguistics)\" title=\"Morphology (linguistics)\">morphology</a> of spoken demotic).<sup id=\"cite_ref-Mackridge_2009_3-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Mackridge_2009-3\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">:<span>261</span></sup>\n</p><p>Psycharis rejected all such borrowings. Instead, he coined the word <span lang=\"grc\" title=\"Ancient Greek language text\">\u03be\u03b5\u03c4\u03c5\u03bb\u03b9\u03be\u03b9\u03ac</span>, which he claimed was the word spoken Greek would have evolved for the concept of <i>evolution</i> if it had been free of the corrupting influence of <i>katharevousa</i>.  He created many such words on the same principle; his declared aim was to set up a revitalized, scientifically derived demotic as a new written standard based entirely on the spoken language, isolated from <i>katharevousa</i> and independent of it.\n</p><p>Some found the new coinages ugly and unnatural: \"Psycharis' versions sounded like mispronunciations of learned words by uneducated people, who would be unlikely to be familiar with many of these words in the first place.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-Mackridge_2009_3-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Mackridge_2009-3\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">:<span>277</span></sup> Others were inspired by Psycharis' vision and became enthusiastic supporters of his version of demotic.

Although he met some <a href=\"/wiki/Greek_language_question#Contemporary_reception_of_My_Journey\" title=\"Greek language question\">opposition</a>, it was at first mainly good-humoured, constructive, and centred on linguistic and cultural issues.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Mackridge_2009_3-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Mackridge_2009-3\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">:<span>227\u20139, 233\u20139</span></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Linguistic_situation_in_1896\">Linguistic situation in 1896</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Gospel_riots&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Linguistic situation in 1896\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>By 1896, the situation might be summarized as follows: Ancient Greek was established firmly in the Church, in <a href=\"/wiki/Secondary_schools\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Secondary schools\">secondary schools</a>, and also in <a href=\"/wiki/Primary_schools\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Primary schools\">primary schools</a> (with some <i>katharevousa</i> there since 1881). <i>Katharevousa</i> was still used for every kind of administration and for non-fiction literature, but in <a href=\"/wiki/Prose_fiction\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Prose fiction\">prose fiction</a> it was just beginning to give way to demotic. In <a href=\"/wiki/Poetry\" title=\"Poetry\">poetry</a>, demotic had taken the lead.\n</p><p>The supporters of <i>katharevousa</i> were on the defensive, but the demoticist movement was split between the \"extreme\" demoticists spearheaded by Psycharis and Pallis, and the \"moderate\" demoticists who were less doctrinaire, and much more tolerant of borrowing from <i>katharevousa</i> (it was these moderates who would finally win the language debate 80 years later).\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Religious_background:_previous_gospel_translations\">Religious background: previous gospel translations</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Gospel_riots&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Religious background: previous gospel translations\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Bible_translations_into_Greek\" title=\"Bible translations into Greek\">Bible translations into Greek</a></div>\n<p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church\" title=\"Eastern Orthodox Church\">Eastern Orthodox Church</a> had never had theological objections, in principle, to translation of the Ancient <i>koine</i> Greek gospels into a more modern form of Greek closer to the spoken language.  \"The first translation appeared in the 11th century and until the beginning of the 19th century as many as twenty-five had been published.

Pallis spent most of his life working in the British Empire, becoming a British citizen in 1897, and came to share its general belief that all nations and peoples should have access to the Gospels in their own spoken languages.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Mackridge_2009_3-18\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Mackridge_2009-3\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">:<span>244, 247</span></sup>\n</p><p>Finally he had a political, demoticist motive:  \"Most of all, his translation of the Gospels aimed to foster national, moral and political regeneration after the 1897 defeat, both by enhancing the prestige of the colloquial modern language and by democratizing and modernizing national culture and opening it up to the broad masses of the population.\"  (Mackridge 2009 p.&#160;249)\n</p><p>Motivated as he was, Pallis saw little need for extensive consultations like those of the Queen.  He naturally discussed the matter with Psycharis, who advised caution.  \"Psycharis was sensible enough to leave religion alone, and he had advised Pallis to do the same, arguing that it was provocative enough for the demoticists to be challenging the secular authority of <i>katharevousa</i> without challenging the Orthodox Church as well.\"  (Mackridge 2009 p.&#160;252)  This cautious approach was typical of the demoticist movement of the time:  \"Also, although this was not stated explicitly, it was essentially a secular movement.\"  (Mackridge 2009 p.&#160;229)  Up to this point, the demoticist movement and the Church had left each other alone; neither one had challenged the other.  Pallis, however, was not dissuaded.\n</p><p>It is notable that neither of the demotic Gospel translators of 1901 was a mainstream demoticist.

The translation was considered anti-religious, anti-national, full of vulgar words, degrading the true spirit and meaning of the Gospel.  The accusations levelled against Pallis himself were equally devastating.  He was called a traitor; one who had no <i>patrida</i> [homeland]; an agent of Pan-Slavism; a foolish and despicable merchant of ivory and indigo; a sleazy person who alongside the <i>malliari</i> ['hairies'] was attempting to dislodge <i>katharevousa</i> as the official language of the state; an evil little creature who ought to be excommunicated.\"  (Carabott 1993 p.&#160;126)\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Suspicions_of_Pan-Slavism\">Suspicions of Pan-Slavism</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Gospel_riots&amp;action=edit&amp;section=17\" title=\"Edit section: Suspicions of Pan-Slavism\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:152px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Blasis_Gavriilidis_-_Karikatur.JPG\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/Blasis_Gavriilidis_-_Karikatur.JPG/150px-Blasis_Gavriilidis_-_Karikatur.JPG\" width=\"150\" height=\"304\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/Blasis_Gavriilidis_-_Karikatur.JPG/225px-Blasis_Gavriilidis_-_Karikatur.JPG 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/Blasis_Gavriilidis_-_Karikatur.JPG/300px-Blasis_Gavriilidis_-_Karikatur.JPG 2x\" data-file-width=\"363\" data-file-height=\"735\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Blasis_Gavriilidis_-_Karikatur.JPG\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Vlasis Gavriilidis in 1898, from <i>Estia</i></div></div></div>\n<p>It is not known why Gavriilidis made such a point of announcing that <i>Akropolis</i> was \"continuing the work of the Queen\".  Possibly he hoped to share the immunity from criticism that she had apparently been enjoying since February.  If so, he took a great risk in associating himself with the Queen and her supposedly Pan-Slavist family connections; it seems that many took \u2014 or pretended to take \u2014 his introductory editorial as a declaration of intent to \"continue the Queen's work\" of Pan-Slavic subversion.   All the old opponents of the Queen's translation immediately sprang to the attack again with redoubled energy, since Pallis and Gavriilidis had struck the same nerve as the Queen: the gap between the spoken and written languages.  The format of the Queen's book had only implied that some of the least educated might need a little help with written Ancient Greek; now Gavriilidis had announced on a front page that a majority of the population could not understand it at all.  The fact that this was true did nothing to diminish the reawakened fury of the conservative nationalists.\n</p><p>Gavriilidis, however, continued to insist on the link with the Queen.  \"Throughout the whole of October, in the columns of <i>Akropolis</i>, he continued emphatically to link Pallis' translation with that of Queen Olga, pointing out that the former was merely the continuation of the latter.  In fact, he phrased his articles in a way that implied that the Queen herself was actually behind Pallis' translation.\"  (Carabott 1993 p.&#160;126)\n</p><p>This only served to confirm the popular suspicion that Pallis' translation was the next step in some Pan-Slavic master-plan.  By November the two very different translations had become inextricably linked in the public mind; they would now stand or fall together.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Suspicions_of_foreign_Protestant_influence\">Suspicions of foreign Protestant influence</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Gospel_riots&amp;action=edit&amp;section=18\" title=\"Edit section: Suspicions of foreign Protestant influence\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>Pallis' translation, however, while still subject to all the old criticisms that had been directed at the Queen's work, also attracted new kinds of political, linguistic and personal attack.  His long residence in the British Empire aroused suspicions of British influence, and his adopted British nationality laid him open to the accusation of being a traitor, \"one who had no <i>patrida</i>\".  British influence in itself would not have been too threatening, since Britain had always been a reliable supporter of the young Greek state; but the British were predominantly Protestant, and the thought of a Protestant 'foreign finger' awoke memories of the 1830s threat from the missionary societies that had brought about the ban on Bible translations in the first place.  Although Pallis was an Orthodox believer, he had certainly \"developed anti-clerical leanings and had come to believe that the sacred texts of Christianity should be available to all people in their own language for their own private study.\"  (Mackridge 2009 p.&#160;247)  To the Orthodox Church, these seemed suspiciously similar to Protestant views, coming as they did from a British citizen.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Linguistic_criticism\">Linguistic criticism</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Gospel_riots&amp;action=edit&amp;section=19\" title=\"Edit section: Linguistic criticism\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>The actual language of the translation also provoked widespread criticism.  It was not just demotic, but Psycharis' 'scientifically derived' demotic; and Pallis did not seem to realise that many of Psycharis' innovations, while perhaps charming and natural in the chatty reminiscences of <i>My Journey</i>, might seem out of place and even offensive in the context of a holy book.  Psycharis' rigid linguistic rules did not allow for a change of register to a more elevated style.  In fact, any such change was deprecated as contamination from <i>katharevousa</i>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">&#91;j&#93;</a></sup>  \"Many readers were shocked by the sheer novelty of seeing a familiar text in the unfamiliar guise of a highly colloquial and sometimes idiosyncratic variety of their language.

For  Luke 23.4, \"Remember me, Lord, when thou comest into thy kingdom\", the Ancient Greek is '\u039c\u03bd\u03ae\u03c3\u03b8\u03b7\u03c4\u03af  \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5,  \u039a\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03b5,  \u03cc\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd  \u03ad\u03bb\u03b8\u03b7\u03c2  \u03b5\u03bd  \u03c4\u03b7  \u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03b1  \u03c3\u03bf\u03c5'.

For such people Greek is the sacred language of a chosen people. This was claimed by a member of the Greek parliament, Konstantinos Papamichalopoulos, during a debate on the language of school readers in 1907.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-Mackridge_15-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Mackridge-15\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">:<span>179\u201380</span></sup></span>\n</li>\n</ol></div></div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Gospel_riots&amp;action=edit&amp;section=21\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-Carabott_1993-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\">^ <a href=\"#cite_ref-Carabott_1993_2-0\"><sup><i><b>a</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Carabott_1993_2-1\"><sup><i><b>b</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Carabott_1993_2-2\"><sup><i><b>c</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Carabott_1993_2-3\"><sup><i><b>d</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Carabott_1993_2-4\"><sup><i><b>e</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Carabott_1993_2-5\"><sup><i><b>f</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Carabott_1993_2-6\"><sup><i><b>g</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Carabott_1993_2-7\"><sup><i><b>h</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Carabott_1993_2-8\"><sup><i><b>i</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Carabott_1993_2-9\"><sup><i><b>j</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Carabott_1993_2-10\"><sup><i><b>k</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Carabott_1993_2-11\"><sup><i><b>l</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Carabott_1993_2-12\"><sup><i><b>m</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Carabott_1993_2-13\"><sup><i><b>n</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Carabott_1993_2-14\"><sup><i><b>o</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Carabott_1993_2-15\"><sup><i><b>p</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Carabott_1993_2-16\"><sup><i><b>q</b></i></sup></a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><cite class=\"citation journal\">Carabott, Philip (1993). <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20120207054728/http://www.arts.yorku.ca/hist/tgallant/documents/carabottgospelriot_000.pdf\">\"Politics, orthodoxy, and the language question in Greece: the Gospel Riots of 1901\"</a> <span style=\"font-size:85%;\">(PDF)</span>. <i>Journal of Mediterranean Studies</i>. <b>3</b> (1): 117\u2013138. <a href=\"/wiki/International_Standard_Serial_Number\" title=\"International Standard Serial Number\">ISSN</a>&#160;<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"//www.worldcat.org/issn/1016-3476\">1016-3476</a>.
