In its strongest, unqualified form, <b>the principle of wholistic reference</b> is the <a href=\"/wiki/Proposition\" title=\"Proposition\">proposition</a> that each and every proposition, regardless how limited the referents of its <a href=\"/wiki/Non-logical_symbol\" title=\"Non-logical symbol\">non-logical</a> or content terms, refers to the whole of its <a href=\"/wiki/Universe_of_discourse\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Universe of discourse\">universe of discourse</a>. According to this principle every proposition of <a href=\"/wiki/Number_theory\" title=\"Number theory\">number theory</a>, even an equational proposition such as 5 + 7 = 12, refers not only to the individual numbers that it happens to mention but to the whole universe of numbers.  The relation verb \u2018refers\u2019 is being used in its broad sense (loosely \u201cis about\u201d) and not as a synonym for \u2018names\u2019 in the sense of \u201cis a name of\u201d.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/George_Boole\" title=\"George Boole\">George Boole</a> (1815\u20131864) introduced this principle into modern logic: Even though he changed from a monistic fixed-universe framework in his 1840s writings to a pluralistic multiple-universe framework in 1854,<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> he never wavered in his frank avowal of the principle of wholistic reference.  Indeed, he took it as an essential accompaniment to his theory of concept formation and proposition formation. For Boole, the essential first step in the process of conceiving of a proposition preliminary to making a judgement of its truth or falsity \u2013 or even using it in a deduction, however hypothetically \u2013 was to conceive of the universe of discourse. See Boole 1854/2003, xxi, 27, 42, 43.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> One statement of his principle is in the sentence immediately following his definition of universe of discourse, which is his first use of the expression 'universe of discourse' and probably the first in the history of the English language. See the next section.\n</p><p>Similar views, perhaps not similarly motivated, are found in later logicians, including <a href=\"/wiki/Gottlob_Frege\" title=\"Gottlob Frege\">Gottlob Frege</a> (1848\u20131925).  Some recent formulations of standard one-sorted first-order logic seem to be in accord with a form of it, if they do not actually imply the principle itself.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Boole.E2.80.99s_1854_definition\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Boole\u2019s_1854_definition\">Boole\u2019s 1854 definition</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Wholistic_reference&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Boole\u2019s 1854 definition\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<style data-mw-deduplicate=\"TemplateStyles:r856303468\">.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}</style><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p>In every discourse, whether of the mind conversing with its own thoughts, or of the individual in his intercourse with others, there is an assumed or expressed limit within which the subjects of its operation are confined. The most unfettered discourse is that in which the words we use are understood in the widest possible application, and for them the limits of discourse are co-extensive with those of the universe itself. But more usually we confine ourselves to a less spacious field. Sometimes, in discoursing of men we imply (without expressing the limitation) that it is of men only under certain circumstances and conditions that we speak, as of civilized men, or of men in the vigour of life, or of men under some other condition or relation. Now, whatever may be the extent of the field within which all the objects of our discourse are found, that field may properly be termed the universe of discourse. Furthermore, this universe of discourse is in the strictest sense the ultimate subject of the discourse.</p><div class=\"templatequotecite\">\u2014&#8201;<cite><a href=\"/wiki/George_Boole\" title=\"George Boole\">George Boole</a>, <sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup></cite></div>\n</blockquote>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Wholistic_reference&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a href=\"/wiki/John_Corcoran_(logician)\" title=\"John Corcoran (logician)\">Corcoran, John</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Miguel_Sag%C3%BCillo\" title=\"Jos\u00e9 Miguel Sag\u00fcillo\">Sag\u00fcillo, Jos\u00e9 Miguel</a>, 2011. \u201cThe Absence of Multiple Universes of Discourse in the 1936 Tarski Consequence-Definition Paper\u201d, <i>History and Philosophy of Logic</i> 32: 359\u201380.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-2\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a href=\"/wiki/George_Boole\" title=\"George Boole\">George Boole</a>. 1854/2003. <i>The Laws of Thought.</i> Facsimile of 1854 edition, with an introduction by J.
