Babelfy is a software algorithm for the disambiguation of text written in any language. Specifically, Babelfy performs the tasks of multilingual Word Sense Disambiguation (i.e., the disambiguation of common nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs) and Entity Linking (i.e. the disambiguation of mentions to encyclopedic entities like people, companies, places, etc.).  Babelfy is based on the BabelNet multilingual semantic network and performs disambiguation and entity linking in three steps: As a result, the text, written in any of the 271 languages supported by BabelNet, is output with possibly overlapping semantic annotations.
