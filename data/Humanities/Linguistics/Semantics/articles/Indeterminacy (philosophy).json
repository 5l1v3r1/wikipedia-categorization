It is easy to find loops of definition in any dictionary, because this seems to be the only way that certain concepts, and generally very important ones such as that of <a href=\"/wiki/Existence\" title=\"Existence\">existence</a>, can be defined in the English language. A definition is a collection of other words, and in any finite dictionary if one continues to follow the trail of words in search of the precise meaning of any given term, one will inevitably encounter this linguistic indeterminacy.\n</p><p>Philosophers and scientists generally try to eliminate indeterminate terms from their arguments, since any indeterminate thing is unquantifiable and untestable; similarly, any hypothesis which consists of a statement of the properties of something unquantifiable or indefinable cannot be falsified and thus cannot be said to be supported by evidence that does not falsify it. This is related to <a href=\"/wiki/Karl_Popper\" title=\"Karl Popper\">Popper</a>'s discussions of falsifiability in his works on the <a href=\"/wiki/Scientific_method\" title=\"Scientific method\">scientific method</a>. The <a href=\"/wiki/Quantifiability\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Quantifiability\">quantifiability</a> of data collected during an experiment is central to the scientific method, since reliable conclusions can only be drawn from replicable experiments, and since in order to establish observer agreement scientists must be able to quantify experimental evidence.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Kant_and_hazards_of_positing_the_.22thing_in_itself.22\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Kant_and_hazards_of_positing_the_&quot;thing_in_itself&quot;\">Kant and hazards of positing the \"thing in itself\"</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Indeterminacy_(philosophy)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Kant and hazards of positing the &quot;thing in itself&quot;\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/Immanuel_Kant\" title=\"Immanuel Kant\">Immanuel Kant</a> unwittingly proposed one answer to this question in his <a href=\"/wiki/Critique_of_Pure_Reason\" title=\"Critique of Pure Reason\">Critique of Pure Reason</a> by stating that there must \"exist\" a \"<a href=\"/wiki/Thing_in_itself\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Thing in itself\">thing in itself</a>\"&#160;\u2013 a thing which is the cause of phenomena, but not a <a href=\"/wiki/Phenomenon\" title=\"Phenomenon\">phenomenon</a> itself.

Definitions of various <a href=\"/wiki/Psychiatric_disorders\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Psychiatric disorders\">psychiatric disorders</a> stem, according to philosophers who draw on the work of <a href=\"/wiki/Michel_Foucault\" title=\"Michel Foucault\">Michel Foucault</a>, from a belief that something unobservable and indescribable is fundamentally \"wrong\" with the mind of whoever suffers from such a disorder. Proponents of Foucault's treatment of the concept of insanity would assert that one need only try to quantify various characteristics of such disorders as presented in today's <a href=\"/wiki/Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual\">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual</a> (e.g., <a href=\"/wiki/Delusion\" title=\"Delusion\">delusion</a>, one of the diagnostic criteria which must be exhibited by a patient if he or she is to be considered <a href=\"/wiki/Schizophrenic\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Schizophrenic\">schizophrenic</a>) in order to discover that the field of study known as <a href=\"/wiki/Abnormal_psychology\" title=\"Abnormal psychology\">abnormal psychology</a> relies upon indeterminate concepts in defining virtually each \"mental disorder\" it describes. The quality that makes a belief a delusion is indeterminate to the extent to which it is unquantifiable; arguments that delusion is determined by popular sentiment (i.e., \"almost no-one believes that he or she is made of cheese, and thus that belief is a delusion\") would lead to the conclusion that, for example, <a href=\"/wiki/Alfred_Wegener\" title=\"Alfred Wegener\">Alfred Wegener's</a> assertion of <a href=\"/wiki/Continental_drift\" title=\"Continental drift\">continental drift</a> was a delusion since it was dismissed for decades after it was made.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Nietzsche_and_the_indeterminacy_of_the_.22thing_in_itself.22\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Nietzsche_and_the_indeterminacy_of_the_&quot;thing_in_itself&quot;\">Nietzsche and the indeterminacy of the \"thing in itself\"</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Indeterminacy_(philosophy)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Nietzsche and the indeterminacy of the &quot;thing in itself&quot;\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">See also: <a href=\"/wiki/Nietzsche_and_free_will\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Nietzsche and free will\">Nietzsche and free will</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Eternal_return\" title=\"Eternal return\">Eternal return</a></div>\n<p>Relevant criticism of Kant's original formulation of the \"thing in itself\" can be found in the works of <a href=\"/wiki/Friedrich_Wilhelm_Nietzsche\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche\">Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche</a>, who argued against what he held to be the indeterminate nature of such concepts as the Platonic idea, the subject, the Kantian noumenon, the opposition of \"appearance\" to \"reality\", etc. Nietzsche concisely argued against Kant's <a href=\"/wiki/Noumenon\" title=\"Noumenon\">noumenon</a> in his <i>On Truth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense</i> as follows:\n</p>\n<dl><dd>\"The 'thing in itself' (which is precisely what the pure truth, apart from any of its consequences, would be) is likewise something quite incomprehensible to the creator of language and something not in the least worth striving for.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup></dd></dl>\n<p>In his <i>Beyond Good and Evil</i>, Nietzsche argues against the \"misleading significance of words\" and its production of a \"thing in itself\":\n</p>\n<dl><dd>\"I would repeat it, however, a hundred times, that 'immediate certainty,' as well as 'absolute knowledge' and the 'thing in itself,' involve a CONTRADICTIO IN ADJECTO; we really ought to free ourselves from the misleading significance of words!\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup></dd></dl>\n<p>Furthermore, Nietzsche argued against such singularities as the atom in the scientific models of his day in <i>The Will to Power</i>:\n</p>\n<dl><dd>\"For all its detachment and freedom from emotion, our science is still the dupe of linguistic habits; it has never got rid of those changelings called 'subjects.'

Even in a mathematical statement as simple as \"x=x\", one encounters fundamental differences between the two \"x\"es under consideration: firstly, that there are two distinct \"x\"es, in that they neither occupy the same space on this page nor in one's own mind. There would otherwise be only one \"x\". Secondly, that if two things were absolutely equal in every possible respect, then there would necessarily be no reason to consider their equality. Nothing could lead anyone to consider the possibility or impossibility of their equality if there were no properties <i>not</i> shared between \"them\", since there would necessarily be no relationship between them whatsoever. Thirdly, and most importantly, if two things were equal in every possible respect they would necessarily not be two things, but the very same thing, since there would be no difference to separate them.\n</p><p>In examples as odd as this, the differences between two approximately equal things may be very small indeed, and it is certainly true that they are quite irrelevant to most discussions. Acceptance of the reflexive property illustrated above has led to useful mathematical discoveries which have influenced the life of anyone reading this article on a computer. But in an examination of the possibility of the determinacy of any possible concept, differences like this are supremely relevant since that quality which could possibly make two separate things \"equal\" seems to be indeterminate.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Indeterminacy_of_meaning_and_translation\">Indeterminacy of meaning and translation</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Indeterminacy_(philosophy)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Indeterminacy of meaning and translation\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>See:\n</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Willard_Van_Orman_Quine\" title=\"Willard Van Orman Quine\">Willard Van Orman Quine</a>: <a href=\"/wiki/Indeterminacy_of_translation\" title=\"Indeterminacy of translation\">indeterminacy of translation</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Indeterminacy_of_reference\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Indeterminacy of reference\">indeterminacy of reference</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Donald_Davidson_(philosopher)\" title=\"Donald Davidson (philosopher)\">Donald Davidson</a>: <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Indeterminacy_of_interpretation&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Indeterminacy of interpretation (page does not exist)\">indeterminacy of interpretation</a><sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup></li></ul>\n<h3><span id=\"The_indeterminacy_of_the_pharmakon_in_Derrida.27s_Plato.27s_Pharmacy\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_indeterminacy_of_the_pharmakon_in_Derrida's_Plato's_Pharmacy\">The indeterminacy of the <i>pharmakon</i> in Derrida's <a href=\"/wiki/Plato%27s_Pharmacy\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Plato&#39;s Pharmacy\">Plato's Pharmacy</a></span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Indeterminacy_(philosophy)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: The indeterminacy of the pharmakon in Derrida&#039;s Plato&#039;s Pharmacy\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Pharmakon_(philosophy)\" title=\"Pharmakon (philosophy)\">Pharmakon (philosophy)</a></div>\n<p>Indeterminacy was discussed in one of <a href=\"/wiki/Jacques_Derrida\" title=\"Jacques Derrida\">Jacques Derrida's</a> early works <i><a href=\"/wiki/Plato%27s_Pharmacy\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Plato&#39;s Pharmacy\">Plato's Pharmacy</a></i> (1969),<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> a reading of <a href=\"/wiki/Plato\" title=\"Plato\">Plato</a>'s <i>Phaedrus</i> and <i>Phaedo</i>.

As the story goes, Thoth presents his invention to the god-king of Upper Egypt for judgment.  Upon its presentation, Thoth offers script as a <i>pharmakon</i> for the Egyptian people.  The Greek word <a href=\"/wiki/Pharmakon_(philosophy)\" title=\"Pharmakon (philosophy)\">pharmakon</a> poses a quandary for translators: it is both a remedy and a poison.  In the proffering of a pharmakon, Thoth presents it as its true meaning: a harm and benefit.  The god-king, however, refuses the invention. Through various reasonings, he determines the pharmakon of writing to be a bad thing for the Egyptian people.  The pharmakon, the undecidable, has been returned decided.  The problem, as Derrida reasons, is this: since the word pharmakon, in the original Greek, means both a remedy and a poison, it cannot be determined as fully remedy or fully poison. Amon rejected writing as fully poison in Socrates' retelling of the tale, thus shutting out the other possibilities.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Foucault_and_the_indeterminacy_of_insanity\">Foucault and the indeterminacy of insanity</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Indeterminacy_(philosophy)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Foucault and the indeterminacy of insanity\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The philosopher <a href=\"/wiki/Michel_Foucault\" title=\"Michel Foucault\">Michel Foucault</a> wrote about the existence of such problems of precise definition in the very concept of <a href=\"/wiki/Insanity\" title=\"Insanity\">insanity</a> itself&#160;\u2013 a <i>very</i> rough approximation of his argument can be found in the late social commentator and journalist <a href=\"/wiki/Hunter_S._Thompson\" title=\"Hunter S. Thompson\">Hunter S. Thompson</a>'s book, <i><a href=\"/wiki/Kingdom_of_Fear_(book)\" title=\"Kingdom of Fear (book)\">Kingdom of Fear</a></i>:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>\"The only difference between the Sane and the Insane, is IN and yet within this world, the Sane have the power to have the Insane locked up.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup></p></blockquote>\n<p>Another summary of Foucault's original argument against the indeterminacy of the concept of insanity in his <i>Madness and Civilization</i> can be found in the following excerpt from the <i>Literature, Arts, and Medicine Database</i>:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>\"Central to this is the notion of confinement as a meaningful exercise. Foucault's history explains how the mad came first to be confined; how they became identified as confined due to moral and economic factors that determined those who ought to be confined; how they became perceived as dangerous through their confinement, partly by way of atavistic identification with the lepers whose place they had come to occupy; how they were 'liberated' by Pinel and Tuke, but in their liberation remained confined, both physically in asylums and in the designation of being mad; and how this confinement subsequently became enacted in the figure of the psychiatrist, whose practice is 'a certain moral tactic contemporary with the end of the eighteenth century, preserved in the rites of the asylum life, and overlaid by the myths of positivism.' Science and medicine, notably, come in at the later stages, as practices 'elaborated once this division' between the mad and the sane has been made (ix).\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup></p></blockquote>\n<p>In <i>The Archaeology of Knowledge</i>, Foucault addresses indeterminacy directly by discussing the origin of the meaning of concepts:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>\"Foucault directs his analysis toward the 'statement', the basic unit of discourse that he believes has been ignored up to this point. 'Statement' is the English translation from French \u00e9nonc\u00e9 (that which is enunciated or expressed), which has a peculiar meaning for Foucault. '\u00c9nonc\u00e9' for Foucault means that which makes propositions, utterances, or speech acts meaningful. In this understanding, statements themselves are not propositions, utterances, or speech acts. Rather, statements create a network of rules establishing what is meaningful, and it is these rules that are the preconditions for propositions, utterances, or speech acts to have meaning. Statements are also 'events'. Depending on whether or not they comply with the rules of meaning, a grammatically correct sentence may still lack meaning and inversely, an incorrect sentence may still be meaningful. Statements depend on the conditions in which they emerge and exist within a field of discourse. It is huge collections of statements, called discursive formations, toward which Foucault aims his analysis.\n</p><p>[...]\n</p><p>\nRather than looking for a deeper meaning underneath discourse or looking for the source of meaning in some transcendental subject, Foucault analyzes the conditions of existence for meaning.

The less-precisely such states as \"insanity\" and \"criminality\" are defined in a society, the more likely that society is to fail to continue over time to describe the same behaviors as characteristic of those states (or, alternately, to characterize such states in terms of the same behaviors).\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Indeterminacy_in_discourse_analysis\">Indeterminacy in discourse analysis</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Indeterminacy_(philosophy)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: Indeterminacy in discourse analysis\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Steve Hoenisch asserts in his article <i>Interpretation and Indeterminacy in <a href=\"/wiki/Discourse_Analysis\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Discourse Analysis\">Discourse Analysis</a></i> that \"[T]he exact meaning of a speaker's utterance in a contextualized exchange is often indeterminate.

The wide influences of Platonism and Kantianism in Western philosophy can arguably be partially attributed to the indeterminacies of some of their most fundamental concepts (namely, the Idea and the <a href=\"/wiki/Noumenon\" title=\"Noumenon\">Noumenon</a>, respectively).\n</p><p>For a given meme to exhibit replication and heritability&#160;\u2013 that is, for it to be able to make an <i>imperfect copy</i> of itself which is more likely to share any given trait with its \"parent\" meme than with some random member of the general \"population\" of memes&#160;\u2013 it must in some way be mutable, since memetic replication occurs by means of human conceptual imitation rather than via the discrete molecular processes that govern genetic replication. (If a statement were to generate copies of itself <i>that didn't meaningfully differ from it</i>, that process of copying would more accurately be described as \"duplication\" than as \"replication\", and it would be incorrect to term these statements \"memes\"; the same would be true if the \"child\" statements did <i>not</i> noticeably inherit a substantial proportion of their traits from their \"parent\" statements.)\nIn other words, if a meme is defined roughly (and somewhat arbitrarily) as a statement (or as a collection of statements, like Foucault's \"discursive formations\") that inherits <i>some</i>, but not <i>all</i>, of its properties (or elements of its definition) from its \"parent\" memes and which self-replicates, then indeterminacy of definition could be seen as <i>advantageous</i> to memetic replication, since an absolute rigidity of definition would preclude memetic adaptation.\n</p><p>It is important to note that indeterminacy in <a href=\"/wiki/Linguistics\" title=\"Linguistics\">linguistics</a> can arguably partially be defeated by the fact that languages are always changing. However, what the entire language and its collected changes continue to reflect is sometimes still considered to be indeterminate.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Criticism\">Criticism</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Indeterminacy_(philosophy)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11\" title=\"Edit section: Criticism\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Persons of <a href=\"/wiki/Faith\" title=\"Faith\">faith</a> argue that faith \"is the basis of all knowledge\".

Thus, if faith is to be considered as a reliable basis for knowledge, persons of faith would seem, in effect, to assert that indeterminacy is not only necessary, but good (see <a href=\"/wiki/Nassim_Taleb\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Nassim Taleb\">Nassim Taleb</a>).\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Indeterminacy_in_new_physical_theories\">Indeterminacy in new physical theories</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Indeterminacy_(philosophy)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12\" title=\"Edit section: Indeterminacy in new physical theories\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/Science\" title=\"Science\">Science</a> generally attempts to eliminate vague definitions, causally inert entities, and indeterminate properties, via further observation, experimentation, characterization, and explanation. <a href=\"/wiki/Occam%27s_razor\" title=\"Occam&#39;s razor\">Occam's razor</a> tends to eliminate causally inert entities from functioning models of quantifiable phenomena, but some quantitative models, such as <a href=\"/wiki/Quantum_mechanics\" title=\"Quantum mechanics\">quantum mechanics</a>, actually imply certain indeterminacies, such as the relative indeterminacy of quantum particles' positions to the precision with which their momenta can be measured (and vice versa).
