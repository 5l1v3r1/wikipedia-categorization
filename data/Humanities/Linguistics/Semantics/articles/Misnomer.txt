A misnomer is a name or term that suggests an idea that is known to be wrong.  Misnomers often arise because something was named long before its correct nature was known, or because the nature of an earlier form is no longer the norm. A misnomer may also be simply a word that someone uses incorrectly or misleadingly.  The word "misnomer" does not mean "misunderstanding" or "popular misconception",  and a number of misnomers remain in common usage — which is to say, the fact of a word being a misnomer does not necessarily make usage of the word incorrect. Some of the sources of misnomers are:  The term anachronym (note well -chron-) as defined in Garner's Modern English Usage   refers to this type of misnomer. Examples cited by Garner include the persistence of the word dial in its telephoning sense after the rotary dial era and the persistence of the term tin foil in the aluminum foil era.  Anachronyms should not be homophonously confused with anacronyms (note well -acro-), which are words such as laser and sonar that have acronymic origin but are generally no longer treated like conventional acronyms (that is, they are used syntactically like any other words, without obligate reference to their original expansions). "Hinduism" is considered a misnomer. Introduced in the 1800s by the British and with its etymological origins purely in the geography of the region of the Indus, "Hinduism" has become a collective term for all the diverse religions and spiritualities indigenous to the Indian subcontinent.
