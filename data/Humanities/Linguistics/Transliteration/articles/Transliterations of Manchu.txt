There are several systems for transliteration of the Manchu alphabet which is used for the Manchu and Xibe languages.  These include the Möllendorff transliteration system invented by the German linguist Paul Georg von Möllendorff, BabelPad transliteration (used for ease of input, not for formal transcription), the transliteration of the A Comprehensive Manchu-Chinese Dictionary (CMCD), and Abkai Transliteration (former: Daicing Transliteration). There is also a system of Cyrillization by Ivan Zakharov for transcribing Manchu into Cyrillic. In the transliteration of CMCD, separate s and h are written as s'h to avoid the confusion with sh.
