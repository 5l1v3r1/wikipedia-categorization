Below is a list of Russian language exonyms for places, mainly in Europe. Note that this list only includes names that are significantly different from the local toponym, some exonyms are marked as historical, modern exonyms may match the toponyms. Names for most biblical toponyms are based on the Greek version; however, names for modern toponyms, even when derived from biblical names, are transliterated (e.g. Назаре́т, but Нацра́т-Илит).
