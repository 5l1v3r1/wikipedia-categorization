The Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA) is a more than 450-million-word corpus of American English. It was created by Mark Davies, Professor of Corpus Linguistics at Brigham Young University.  The corpus is composed of more than 560 million words from more than 160,000 texts, including 20 million words from each of the years 1990 through 2017. The most recent update was made in December 2017. The corpus is used by approximately tens of thousands of people each month,  which may make it the most widely used "structured" corpus currently available.  For each year, the corpus is evenly divided between the following five genres: spoken, fiction, popular magazines, newspapers, and academic journals. The texts come from a variety of sources: The corpus is free to search through its web interface,  with a limit on the number of queries per day, and less-restricted access is available at cost.  The full corpus texts are available for a further fee.
