 The following is a list of English-speaking population by country, including information on both native speakers and second-language speakers. Some numbers have been calculated by Wikipedia editors by mixing data from different sources;  figures not attributed to sources and given with a date should be treated with caution. Also note that in most sources, the results shown are of people who say that they can speak English, while that was not verified; which means the actual number of English speakers could be higher or lower (because of certain people that over- or underestimate their English skills).
