  A polyglot is a person with a command of many languages.  A polyglot may also be called a multilingual person; the label "multilingual" is used for communities as well as individual speakers. Richard Hudson, professor emeritus of linguistics at University College London, coined the term "hyperpolyglot" for "people  who know dozens of languages well".   Other scholars apply the label to speakers of even more languages: twelve, sixteen, or in the most extreme cases, even fifty or more.  It is difficult to judge which individuals are polyglots, as there is no uncontroversial definition for what it means to "master" a language, and because it is not always clear where to distinguish a dialect from a language.  Being able to communicate in a language does not mean the person has "mastered" a language.  There are far fewer who have attained higher levels of multi-linguistic skill, and there is no basis for testing those levels, or at least those levels of ability have not been noted here. This list consists of people who have been noted in news media, historical texts, or academic work as speaking five or more languages fluently. For general discussion of the phenomenon, including discussion of polyglot savants, see polyglotism. The 2012 book Babel No More  by Michael Erard highlights some polyglots around the globe, including Alexander Arg√ºelles. Canada's Global TV also brought out a piece on hyperpolyglots on their 16x9 show, entitled "Word Play",  featuring Canadian polyglots Axel Van Hout, Alexandre Coutu, Steven Kaufmann, James Chang and Keith Swayne. Tim Doner (US) and Richard Simcott (UK) also appear in the programme to describe their experiences speaking multiple languages.
