The American linguist Joseph Greenberg (1915-2001) proposed a set of linguistic universals based primarily on a set of 30 languages.  The following list is verbatim from the list printed in the appendix of Greenberg's Universals of Language  and "Universals Restated",   sorted by context. Note: The entries below require additional explanations and notation. The numbering is fixed to keep Greenberg's number associations, as these are commonly referenced by number, for example "Greenberg's linguistic universal number 12."
