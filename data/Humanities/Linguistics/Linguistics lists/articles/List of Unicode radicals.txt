The List of Unicode radicals comprises those Unicode characters that represent radical components of CJK characters, Tangut characters or Yi syllables. These are used primarily for indexing characters in dictionaries. There are two CJK radicals blocks: the "Kangxi Radicals" block that includes the 214 standard radicals used in the Kangxi Dictionary; and the "CJK Radicals Supplement" block that includes 115 radical components used in other modern dictionaries, including simplified Chinese and Japanese radicals forms.  There is one "Tangut Components" block that includes 755 radicals and components that are used to index Tangut characters in dictionaries of the Tangut script or to describe the structure of Tangut characters.  There is one "Yi Radicals" block that includes 55 radicals used to index Yi characters in dictionaries of the Yi script.  Sets of radicals for other sinoform scripts, such as Jurchen and Khitan small script, have also been proposed for encoding in Unicode.
