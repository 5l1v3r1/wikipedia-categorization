In linguistics, anaphoric clitics refer to a specific subset of morphologically-bound morphemes that syntactically resemble one word unit, but are bound phonologically to another word unit. They are identified by their reference to previously mentioned constituents, and substitute for noun phrases. Notably, they are also mutually exclusive with full noun phrases.
