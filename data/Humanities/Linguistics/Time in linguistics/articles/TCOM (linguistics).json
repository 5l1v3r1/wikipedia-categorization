T<sub>UTT</sub> is always the primary point of reference for tense.  There are three additional references to which T<sub>UTT</sub> can be contrasted:  T<sub>AST</sub> \u2014 the <a href=\"/wiki/Time_of_assertion\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Time of assertion\">time of assertion</a>, T<sub>COM</sub> \u2014 the time of completion, and T<sub>EVL</sub> \u2014 the <a href=\"/wiki/Time_of_evaluation\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Time of evaluation\">time of evaluation</a>; these are secondary references.  The type used for the secondary reference is determined by aspect and type of utterance.\n</p><p>T<sub>COM</sub> is the point in time at which a verb is completed.  T<sub>COM</sub> is used with perfected forms.  In perfected non-durational aspects it represents the time by which a verb is finished, as in English \u201cI have eaten dinner.\u201d  In perfected durational aspects it represents either the time at which a verb is finished, or more normally, a time up to which the verb is completed (but that it may continue beyond); this meaning of interrupting the verb is the more standard use of this form and allows the duration of the verb to be measured up to a given point (T<sub>COM</sub>).  Consider \u201cI had been eating for 2 hours by 7pm,\u201d in which an action (eating) has a duration, of which two hours of it is completed as of 7pm.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=TCOM_(linguistics)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li>Mezhevich, Ilana (2008) Time-Relational Approach to Tense and Mood.</li>\n<li>Bybee, Joan (1995) Modality &amp; Grammar in Discourse.
