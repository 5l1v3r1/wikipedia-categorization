In translation, the source language is the language being translated from; it is the antonym of the target language, which is the language being translated to.  Part of the difficulty in translation arises due to the lexical gap and syntactical differences between the source language and the target language, especially between two languages belonging to different language families.  In most professional settings, the source language is also the translator's second language.  Back-translation is the process whereby a text that has been translated from the source language to the target language and then a second translator translates the translation back into the source language. The two source language texts—the original and the back-translation—are then compared.
