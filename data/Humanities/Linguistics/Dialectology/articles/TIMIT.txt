TIMIT is a corpus of phonemically and lexically transcribed speech of American English speakers of different sexes and dialects.  Each transcribed element has been delineated in time. TIMIT was designed to further acoustic-phonetic knowledge and automatic speech recognition systems.  It was commissioned by DARPA and corpus design was a joint effort between the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, SRI International, and Texas Instruments (TI). The speech was recorded at TI, transcribed at MIT, and verified and prepared for publishing by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).  There is also a telephone bandwidth version called NTIMIT (Network TIMIT).   TIMIT and NTIMIT are not freely available â€” either membership of the Linguistic Data Consortium, or a monetary payment, is required for access to the dataset.
