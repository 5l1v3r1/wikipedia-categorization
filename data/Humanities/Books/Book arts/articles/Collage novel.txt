A Collage novel is a form of artist's book approaching closely (but preceding) the graphic novel. Images are selected from other publications and collaged together following a theme or narrative (not necessarily linear). The Dadaist and Surrealist Max Ernst (1891-1976) is generally credited with inventing the collage novel, employing nineteenth-century engravings cut and pasted together to create new images. His works include Les Malheurs des immortels (1922), La Femme 100 Têtes (1929), Rêve d'une petite fille... (1930) and Une Semaine de Bonté (1933-1934). The text for Les Malheurs des immortels was written by Paul Éluard.
