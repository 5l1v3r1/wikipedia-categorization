A bone folder, bonefolder, or folding bone is a dull-edged hand tool used to fold and crease material in crafts such as bookbinding,   cardmaking,  origami,  and other paper crafts  that require a sharp crease or fold. The tool was also used when correspondence by letter writing was more formal and an art. Often made from the leg bone of a cow, deer, or similar animal and ivory.  Alternatives made from plastic now exist; however, those made from bone may be less likely to leave residue on the workpiece.  In Japan, the equivalent folding tool is traditionally made from bamboo, although alternatives include a Japanese fabric marking tool (hera) and a Western bone folder.
