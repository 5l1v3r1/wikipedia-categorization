The First Lady of the United States is the hostess of the White House. The position is traditionally filled by the wife of the President of the United States, with some historic exceptions. Helen Taft was the first First Lady to get her memoir published during her lifetime. Every memoir by a First Lady published in the 20th and 21st centuries has been a best seller, at times outselling those of their presidential husbands.
