All books in the various Tom Swift book series. The first 25 and the 39th Tom Swift Sr. books are in the public domain all around the world and are available as downloadable texts from Project Gutenberg.  However, in Canada, due to its life plus 50 years policy, and because Howard R. Garis and Thomas Moyston Mitchell died in 1962, on January 1, 2013 volumes 1 to 35 (written by Garis) and 39-40 (written by Mitchell) entered into the Canadian Public Domain. (Canadian Copyright Act, Sections 6.1 and 6.2)  This applies to other countries as well that have a life plus 50 policy.  Volumes 36 to 38, which were written by Harriet Stratemeyer-Adams, will enter the Canadian Public Domain on January 1, 2033. A few of the Tom Swift Jr. books are in the public domain and available as downloadable texts from Project Gutenberg. Eleven titles were released in paperback by Wanderer Books, an imprint of Simon & Schuster.  The first 9 were also printed for libraries in hardcover with dust jackets.  Neal Barrett, Jr. and Mike MacQuay also wrote some of the books.   A twelfth (Chaos on Earth) and thirteenth (The Micro World) book were written, but never published. There are ISBN's registered for volumes 8-11 in this series, but the titles are unknown and it is unknown if any manuscripts exist.
