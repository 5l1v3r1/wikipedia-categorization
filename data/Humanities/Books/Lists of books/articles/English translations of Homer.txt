Achilles' banefull wrath resound, O Goddesse, that imposd Infinite sorrowes on the Greekes, and many brave soules losd From breasts Heroique—sent them farre, to that invisible cave. That no light comforts; and their lims to dogs and vultures gave. To all which Jove's will gave effect; from whom first strife begunne Betwixt Atrides, king of men, and Thetis' godlike Sonne. Achilles Peleus Son's destructive Rage, Great Goddess, sing, which did the Greeks engage In many Woes, and mighty Hero's Ghosts Sent down untimely to the Stygian Coasts: Devouring Vultures on their Bodies prey'd, And greedy Dogs (so was Jove's Will obey'd;) Because Great Agamemnon fell at odds With stern Achilles, Off-spring of the Gods. O Goddess sing what woe the discontent Of Thetis' son brought to the Greeks; what souls Of heroes down to Erebus it sent, Leaving their bodies unto dogs and fowls; Whilst the two princes of the army strove,  King Agamemnon and Achilles stout. That so it should be was the will of Jove, The Wrath of Peleus Son, O Muse, resound; Whose dire Effects the Grecian Army found: And many a Heroe, King, and hardy Knight, Were sent, in early Youth, to Shades of Night: Their Limbs a Prey to Dogs and Vultures made; So was the Sov'reign Will of Jove obey'd: From that ill-omen'd Hour when Strife begun, Betwixt Atrides Great, and Thetis God-like Son.

Begin the verſe, from the ſource of rage,—between Achilles and the ſovereign of men.Achilles sing, O Goddess! Peleus' son; His wrath pernicious, who ten thousand woes Caused to Achaia's host, sent many a soul Illustrious into Ades premature, And Heroes gave (so stood the will of Jove) To dogs and to all ravening fowls a prey, When fierce dispute had separated once The noble Chief Achilles from the son of Atreus, Agamemnon, King of men.

The baneful wrath, O goddess, sing, of Peleus' son, the source Of sorrows dire, and countless woes to all the Grecian force; That wrath which many a stout heroic soul from joyful day To gloomy Hades hurled, and left their mangled limbs a prey To dogs and vultures: thus the will of mightiest Jove was done; Since first contention keen arose, and slumbering strife begun Between Atrides king of men, and Peleus' godlike son. The wrath of Peleus' son, that evil wrath Which on Achaia piled a myriad woes, Oh Goddess, sing: which down to darkness hurled Brave souls of mighty men, and made their flesh A prey to dogs and every ravening fowl.

The man, O Muse, inform, that many a way Wound with his wisdom to his wished stay; That wandered wondrous far, when he the town Of sacred Troy had sack'd and shivered down; The cities of a world of nations,                 With all their manners, minds, and fashions, He saw and knew; at sea felt many woes, Much care sustained, to save from overthrows Himself and friends in their retreat for home; But so their fates he could not overcome,                                    Though much he thirsted it. O men unwise, They perish'd by their own impieties, That in their hunger's rapine would not shun The oxen of the lofty-going Sun, Who therefore from their eyes the day bereft   Of safe return. These acts, in some part left, Tell us, as others, deified Seed of Jove. That prudent Hero's wandering, Muse, rehearse,  Who (Troy b'ing sack'd) coasting the Universe, Saw many Cities, and their various Modes;  Much suffering, tost by Storms on raging Floods,  His Friends conducting to their Native Coast:  But all in vain, for he his Navy lost,  And they their Lives, prophanely feasting on  Herds consecrated to the glorious Sun;  Who much incens'd obstructed so their way,  They ne'er return'd : Jove's Daughter this display. Tell me, O Muse, th’ adventures of the man That having sack’d the sacred town of Troy, Wander’d so long at sea; what course he ran By winds and tempests driven from his way: That saw the cities, and the fashions knew Of many men, but suffer’d grievous pain To save his own life, and bring home his crew; Though for his crew, all he could do was vain, They lost themselves by their own insolence, Feeding, like fools, on the Sun’s sacred kine; Which did the splendid deity incense To their dire fate. Begin, O Muse divine. The man for wisdom’s various arts renown’d, Long exercised in woes, O Muse! resound; Who, when his arms had wrought the destined fall Of sacred Troy, and razed her heaven-built wall, Wandering from clime to clime, observant stray’d, Their manners noted, and their states survey’d, On stormy seas unnumber’d toils he bore, Safe with his friends to gain his natal shore: Vain toils! their impious folly dared to prey On herds devoted to the god of day; The god vindictive doom’d them never more (Ah, men unbless’d!) to touch that natal shore. Oh, snatch some portion of these acts from fate, Celestial Muse! and to our world relate. Muse make the man thy theme, for shrewdness famed And genius versatile, who far and wide A Wand’rer, after Ilium overthrown, Discover’d various cities, and the mind And manners learn’d of men, in lands remote. He num’rous woes on Ocean toss’d, endured, Anxious to save himself, and to conduct His followers to their home; yet all his care Preserved them not; they perish’d self-destroy’d By their own fault; infatuate! who devoured The oxen of the all-o’erseeing Sun, And, punish’d for that crime, return’d no more. Daughter divine of Jove, these things record, As it may please thee, even in our ears. O Muse, inspire me to tell of the crafty  man, who wandered very much after he had  brought to destruction the sacred  city of Tioy, and saw the cities of many  men, and became acquainted with their  disposition. He suffered many griefs in  his mind on the sea, to preserve his own  life, and to obtain a return for his  companions; but not even thus, although  anxious, did he save his companions: for  they perished by their own wickedness,  fools who consumed the cattle of the  Sun who journeys above; but he  deprived them of their return. O  Goddess, daughter of Jove, relate even  to us some of these things at least. Muse! sing the Man by long experience tried, Who, fertile in resources, wander'd wide, And when Troy's sacred walls in dust were laid, Men's varying moods and many a realm survey'd. He much endured on ocean's stormy wave, Intent his followers, and himself to save, In vain:—they perish'd by their guilt undone; Fools! who devour'd the bullocks of the Sun— The God, in vengeance for his cattle slain, In their return destroy'd them on the main. Daughter of Jove! deign thou to us disclose, Celestial Muse, a portion of their woes. O Muse, sing to me of the man full of resources, who wandered very much after he had destroyed the sacred city of Troy, and saw the cities of many  men, and learned their manners. Many  griefs also in his mind did he suffer on  the sea, although seeking to preserve his own life, and the return of his  companions; but not even thus,  although anxious, did he extricate his  companions : for they perished by  their own infatuation, fools! who  devoured the oxen of the Sun who  journeys on high; but he deprived  them of their return. O goddess,  daughter of Jove, relate to us also  some of these things. Sing me, O Muse, that all-experienced Man,  Who, after he Troy's sacred town o'erthrew, Did tossing wander much, and cities scan  Of men a many, and their genius knew;  Woes manifold by sea he suffer'd too  While life and friends' return he 'd fain have won.  Nathless he rescued not his comrades, who  By their own wilful folly were undone;  The fools! that ate the beeves of the o'ergoing Sun.   And from them verily he took away  The day of their return. These things to me,  Daughter of Zeus, O goddess, somewhat say. Tell of the man, thou Muse, much versed, who widely Wandered, when he had sacked Troy’s sacred fortress; Many men’s town he saw, and knew their manners; Many the woes he suffered on the ocean, To win his life, and safety for his comrades. But them he might not rescue, though he loved them; For they were slain amidst their impious daring, Fools, who the cattle of the mighty Sun-god Devoured,—and He cut short their homeward journey. Of all this, Goddess, what thou wilt, inform us. Sing me. O Muse, that hero wandering, Who of men's minds did much experience reap, And knew the citied realms of many a king,  Even from the hour he smote the Trojan keep.  Also a weight of sorrows in the deep,  Brooding he bore, in earnest hope to save,  'Mid hard emprise and labour all to keep,  Himself and comrades from a watery grave —  Whom yet he rescued not with zeal nor yeareings brave;  For they were slain in their own foolishness.    Self-blinded, feasting on Hyperion's kine.  He, the great Sun, in vengeance merciless,  Wroth for the slaughter of his herds divine,  Did bend their fortunes to a stern decline.  And raze out wholly their returning day  With disadventure and destroying tyne —  These even to me, who hearken as I may,  Great goddess, child of Zeus, unfold in verse, I pray! Εννεπε declare μοιI to me, Мουσα Muse,  ανδρα the man πολυτροπον of many fortunes, ός whoπλαγχθη wandered μαλα  πολλα very much, επει when επερσεν he  had destroyed ιερον πτολιεθρον the  sacred city Τροιης of Troy: ιδε δε and saw  αστεα towns και and εγνων learnt νοον  the mood πολλων ανθρωπων of many  men, πολλα δε αλγεα but many sorrows  όγε he indeed παθε suffered όν κατα  θυμον in his soul, αρνυμενος while  grasping ήν τε ψυχην both his own life και  and νοστον the return έταιρων of his  companions. Αλλα but ουδε not even ώς  thus ερρυσατο did he save έταρους his  companions ίεμενος περ though bent  upon it: ολοντο γαρ for they perished  σφετερησιν ατασσθαλιησι by their own  phrensies, νηπιοι fools, όι who κατα  ησθιον ate up βους  the oxen Ήελιοιο of  the SunΎπερινος who rolls above us:  αυταρ but ό he αφειλετο took away τοισι  from them νοστιμον ημαρ the day of their  return: των of these things άμοθεν γε from  whatever source, θεα O goddess, θυγατερ daughter Διος of Jupiter, ειπε tell και ημιν  to us also. The travelled Man of many a turn,—driven far, Far wandering, when he had sacked Troy’s sacred Town; Tell me, O Muse, his tale; how too he conned The manners of mankind, and visited Full many a City, and how on the deep he suffered Many a heart-pang, striving to secure His own and comrades’ lives and safe return,  Yet them he rescued not, howe’er desirous; For by their own blind folly they all perished: Fools that they were! to eat the Sun-god’s herds; So, Hyperion, he who Walks above, Bereft them of their day of home-return! Whereof, from whatsoever source, O goddess, Daughter of Zeus, vouchsafe to tell e’en Us!— Tell me, O Muse, declare to me that man Tost to and fro by fate, who, when his arms Had laid Troy’s holy city in the dust, Far wand’ring roam’d on many a tribe of men To bend his gaze, their minds and thoughts to learn. Grief upon grief encounter’d he, when, borne On ocean-waves, his life he carried off A prize from perils rescued, and would fain Have homeward led his brethren in arms; But, not to him,—not to his anxious zeal Was giv’n their rescue; destin’d as they were In their mad arrogance to perish; fools! That dared to seize, and to consume for food, Hyperion’s herds, the oxen of the Sun That walks on high, by whose behest the day Of their return was evermore denied. And thou, too, goddess daughter of great Jove, The theme pursue, and thine own record bear! Tell me, oh Muse, of-the-many-sided man, Who wandered far and wide full sore bestead, When he had razed the mighty town of Troy: And-of-many-a-race of human-kind he saw The cities; and he learned their mind and ways : And on the deep full many-a-woe he bore In his own hosom, while he strove to save His proper life, and-his-comrades’ home-return. But them not so he saved with all his zeal; For they in their own wilful folly perished: Infatuates! to devour Hyperion’s kine! So he bereft them of their home-return. Of these things, Goddess, where thou wilt beginning, Daughter of Zeus, the tale tell e’en to us! Sing, Muse, of that deep man, who wander'd much,  When he had raz'd the walls of sacred Troy, And many towns saw, many customs learnt,  And many griefs endur'd upon the sea;  Anxious to save his comrades and himself:  But them he sav'd not, though desiring it:  But through their rash deeds perish'd of that band Those foolish men, who ate Apollo's kine: That god depriv'd them of return's glad day. Of these men, goddess, tell us too in part! Tell me, 0 Muse, of that sagacious man Who, having overthrown the sacred town Of Ilium, wandered far and visited The capitals of many notians, learned The customs of their dwellers, and endured Great suffering on the deep; his life was oft In peril, as he labored to bring back His comrades to their homes. He saved them not, Though earnestly he strove; for they perished all Through their own folly ; for they banqueted, Madmen! upon the oxen of the Sun, — The all-o'erlooking Sun, who cut them off, From their return. O goddess, virgin child Of Jove, relate some'part of this to me. Muse! tell me of the man with much resource, Who wandered far, when sacred Troy he sacked; Saw towns of many men, learned all they knew, Winning his own life and his friends’ return.   Yet them he saved not, earnest though he was, For by their own temerity they died. Fools! who devoured the oxen of the sun, Who from them took the day of their return. [Muse, child of Jove! from some source tell us this.]   — Note: not a translation, per se, but the  Greek text with commentary — O Muse! inspire me to tell of the man, skilled in sxpedients, who wandered very much after he had brought to  destruction the sacred city of Troy,  and saw the cities of many men, and  become acquainted with their  dispositions. And he, indeed, on the  deep, endured in bis mind many  sufferings, whilst endeavoring to  secure his own life and the return of  his companions; but not even thus,  although anxious, did he save his  companions : for they perished by  their own infatuation; foolish [men  that they were], who did eat up the  Sun who journeys above; but he  deprived them of their return [the  day of return]. Of these events,  arising from whatever cause, O  goddess! daughter of Jove, inform  us also. Tell me, Muse, of that man, so ready at need, who wandered far and wide, after he had sacked the sacred citadel of Troy, and many were the  men whose towns he saw and whose mind he  learnt, yea, and many the woes he suffered in  his heart upon the deep, striving to win his own  life and the return of his company. Nay, but even  so he saved not his company, though he desired  it sore. For through the blindness of their own  hearts they perished, fools, who devoured the  oxen of Helios Hyperion: but the god took from  them their day of returning. Of these things,  goddess, daughter of Zeus, whencesoever thou  hast heard thereof, declare thou even unto us. Sing Muse the hero versatile, who roved  So far, so long, after he overthrew Troy's holy citadel ; of many men  He saw the cities, and their manners learned;  And woes he suffered on the deep; he strove  To win his comrades' lives, and safe return.  But all his strivings failed to rescue them:  They perished for their witless sacrilege,  Who ate the oxen of Hyperion Sun;  Hence nevermore saw they their native land.  Daughter of Jove, help us to tell the tale. Muse! of that hero versatile indite to me the song, Doomed, when he sacred Troy had sacked, to wander far and long. Who saw the towns of many men, much knowledge did obtain Anent their ways, and with much woe was heart-wrung on the main, Seeking his own life to preserve, his friends' return to gain. E'en so he rescued not his friends, though eagerly he strove, For them their own infatuate deeds to direful ending drove. Fools, who the sun-god's sacred beeves dared madly to devour, Doomed by his anger ne'er to see of glad return the hour. Sing, goddess, child of mighty Jove, of these events, I pray, And from what starting-point thou wilt begin with me the lay. The Hero of craft-renown, O Song-goddess, chant me his fame, Who, when low he had laid Troy town, unto many a far land came, And many a city beheld he, and knew the hearts of their folk,  And by woes of the sea was unquelled, o'er the rock of his spirit that broke, When he fain would won for a prey his life, and his friends' return, Yet never they saw that day, howsoever his heart might yearn,  But they perished every one, by their own mad deeds did they fall, For they slaughtered the kine of the Sun, and devoured them — fools were they all.  So the God in his wrath took awav their day of return for their guilt.  [(1903 edition): So in anger their home-coming day did the God take away for their guilt.]   O Goddess, inspire my lay, with their tale; take it up as thou wilt.   — Note: not a translation, per se, but the  Greek text with "marginal references, various  readings, notes and appendices." —   — Note: Not a translation, per se, but a commentary. Edition inclusive of Books 11 – 24 — Sing, goddess Muse, the wrath of Peleus' son, The wrath of Achilleus with ruin fraught, That to Achaians brought unnumbered woes, And many mighty souls of heroes hurled To Hades' home but gave themselves a prey To dogs and every fowl. For thus its end The will of Zeus worked out, since at the first Parted in strife those twain, the king of men Atrides and the godlike Achileus. Speak to me, Muse, of the adventurous man who wandered long after he sacked the sacredcitadel of Troy. Many the men whose towns he  saw, whose ways he proved ; and many a pang  he bore in his own breast at sea while struggling  for his' life and his men's safe return. Yet even  so, by all his zeal, he did not save his men; for  through their own perversity they perished—  fools! who devoured the kine of the exhalted  Sun. Wherefore he took away the day of their return. Of this, O goddess, daughter of Zeus,   beginning where thou wilt, speak to us also.Tell me, O Muse, of the Shifty, the man who wandered afar.  After the Holy Burg, Troy town, he had wasted with war; He saw the towns of menfolk, and the mind of men did he learn;  As he warded his life in the world, and his fellow-farers' return,  Many a grief of heart on the deep-sea flood he bore,  Nor yet might he save his fellows, for all that he longed for it sore  They died of their own soul's folly, for witless as they were  They ate up the beasts of the Sun, the Rider of the air,  And he took away from them all their dear returning day;  O goddess, O daughter of Zeus, from whencesoever ye may,  Gather the tale, and tell it, yea even to us at the last! Tell me, O Muse, of the man of many resources, who many  Ills was made to endure, when he Troy's sacred city had wasted; Many the people whose cities he saw, and learned of their customs,  Many also the sorrows he suffered at sea in his spirit,  Striving to save his own life and secure the return of his comrades  But not thus his comrades he saved, however he wished it,  For by their own presumptuous deeds they foolishly perished:  Madmen they, who devoured the sun god, Hyperion's oxen,  And in revenge he took from them their day of returning.  Of these things, thou goddess, daughter of Jove, tell us also. Sing through my lips, O Goddess, sing the man Resourceful, who, storm-buffeted far and wide, After despoiling of Troy's sacred tower, Beheld the cities of mankind, and knew Their various temper! Many on the sea The sorrows in his inmost heart he bore For rescue of his comrades and his life; Those not for all his effort might he save; Fools, of their own perversities they fell, Daring consume the cattle of the Sun Hyperion, who bereft them of return! That we too may have knowledge, sing these things, Daughter of Zeus, beginning whence thou wilt! Tell me, O muse, of that ingenious hero who travelled far and wide after he had sacked the famous town of Troy. Many cities did he visit,  and many were the nations with whose  manners and customs he was acquainted;  moreover he suffered much by sea while  trying to save his own life and bring his  men safely home; but do what he might  he could not save his men, for they  perished through their own sheer folly  in eating the cattle of the Sun-god  Hyperion; so the god prevented them  from ever reaching home. Tell me, too, about  all these things, O daughter of Jove, from  whatsoever source you may know them.  — Note: translation inclusive of  Books 13–24 —O Muse, instruct me of the man who drew  His changeful course through wanderings not a few After he sacked the holy town of Troy,  And saw the cities and the counsel knew  Of many men, and many a time at sea  Within his heart he bore calamity,  While his own life he laboured to redeem  And bring his fellows back from jeopardy.  Yet not his fellows thus from death he won,  Fain as he was to save them: who undone  By their own hearts' infatuation died,  Fools, that devoured the oxen of the Sun,  Hyperion: and therefore he the day  Of their returning homeward reft away.  Goddess, God's daughter, grant that now thereof  We too may hear, such portion as we may. Sing, O Muse, of the man so wary and wise, who in far lands Wandered whenas he had wasted the sacred town of the Trojans. Many a people he saw and beheld their cities and customs, Many a woe he endured in his heart as he tossed on the ocean, Striving to win him his life and to bring home safely his comrades. Ah but he rescued them not, those comrades, much as he wished it. Ruined by their own act of infatuate madness they perished, Fools that they were—who the cows of the sun-god, lord Hyperion, Slaughtered and ate; and he took from the men their day of returning. Sing—whence-ever the lay—sing, Zeus-born goddess, for us too! Tell me, O Muse, of the man of many devices,  who wandered full many ways after he had sacked the sacred citadel of Troy. Many  were the men whose cities he saw and  whose mind he learned, aye, and many  the woes he suffered in his heart upon  the sea, seeking to win his own life and  the return of his comrades. Yet even so  he saved not his comrades, though he  desired it sore, for through their own  blind folly they perished—fools, who  devoured the kine of Helios Hyperion;  but he took from them the day of their  returning. Of these things, goddess,  daughter of Zeus, beginning where thou  wilt, tell thou even unto us. Sing me the Restless Man, O Muse, who roamed the world over,  When, by his wondrous guile, he had sacked Troy's sacred fortress. Cities of various men he saw: their thoughts he discernéd.  Many a time, in the deep, his heart was melted for trouble.  Striving to win his life, and eke return for his comrades:  Yet, though he strove full sore, he could not save his companions,  For, as was meet and just, through deeds of folly they perished:  Fools ! who devoured the oxen of Him who rides in the heavens,  Helios, who, in his course, missed out their day of returning.  Yet, how they fared and died, be gracious, O Goddess, to tell us. Māny a | tĩme in the | deēp [– (pause or 'cæsura')] hĩs | heārt was | mēlted for | trōublē, Tell me, O Muse, of that Great Traveller Who wandered far and wide when he had sacked The sacred town of Troy. Of many men He saw the cities and he learned the mind; Ay, and at heart he suffered many woes Upon the sea, intent to save his life And bring his comrades home. Yet even so His men he could not save for all his efforts, For through their own blind wilfulness they perished; The fools! who ate up Hyperion's kine; And he bereft them of their homing day. Touching these things, beginning where thou wilt, Tell even us, O goddess, child of Zeus. Tell me, O Muse, of that clever hero  who wandered far after capturing the sacred city of Troy. For he saw the  towns and learned the ways of many  peoples. Many hardships too he  suffered on the sea while struggling  for his own life and for the safe return  of his men. Yet all his zeal did not save  his companions. They perished through  their own rashness — the fools! — because  they ate the cattle of the Sun, and he  therefore kept them from reaching  home. Tell us also of this, 0 goddess,  daughter of Zeus, beginning where  you will. Tell  me the tale, Muse, of that man   Of many changes, he who went Wandering so far when he had plundered Troy’s sacred citadel. And many The men whose cities he beheld, Whose minds he learned to know, and many The sorrows that his soul endured Upon the deep the while he strove To save himself from death and bring His comrades home.                                     Of these things now, Daughter of Zeus, O goddess, tell us, Even as thou wilt, the tale. This song of the various-minded man Who after he had plundered The innermost citadel of hallowed Troy Was made to stray grievously About the coasts of men The sport of their customs good or bad While his heart Through all the sea-faring Ached in an agony to redeem himself And bring his company safe home  Vain hope—for them For his fellows he strove in vain Their own witlessness cast them away The fools To destroy for meat The oxen of the most exalted sun Wherefore the Sun-God blotted out The day of their return  Make the tale live for us In all its many bearings This is the story of a man, one who  was never at a loss. He had travelled far in the world, after the sack of Troy,  the virgin fortress; he saw many cities  of men, and learnt their mind; he endured  many troubles and hardships in the  struggle to save his own life and to bring  back his men safe to their homes. He did  his best, but he could not save his  companions. For they perished by their  own madness, because they killed and ate  the cattle of Hyperion the Sun-god, and  the god took care that they should never  see home again. The hero of the tale which I beg the  Muse to help me tell is that resourceful man who roamed the wide world after he  had sacked the holy citadel of Troy. He  saw the cities of many peoples and he  learnt their ways. He suffered many  hardships on the high seas in his  struggles to preserve his life and bring  his comrades home. But he failed to save  those comrades, in spite of all his efforts.  It was their own sin that brought them to  their doom, for in their folly they devoured  the oxen of Hyperion the Sun, and the god  saw to it that they should never return.  This is the tale I pray the divine Muse to  unfold to us. Begin it, goddess, at whatever  point you will. Tell me, O muse, of the hero fated to roam  So long and so far when Ilion's keep he had sack'd, And the city and mind of many a people he knew,  And many a woe he endur'd on the face of the deep  To win both life for himself and his comrades' return;  Yet for all his striving he brought not his company home,  For they by their own blindness at last were stroy'd,  Fools! who ate of the sacred beeves of the Sun  And he, Hyperion, ras'd out their day of return:  Sing, then, O daughter of Zeus, that Wanderer's tale. Tell me, Muse, of the man of many ways,  who was driven far journeys, after he had sacked Troy's sacred citadel. Many were  they whose cities he saw, whose minds he  learned of, many the pains he suffered in  his spirit on the wide sea, struggling for  his own life and the homecoming of his  companions. Even so he could not save  his companions, hard though he strove  to; they were destroyed by their own  wild recklessness, fools, who devoured  the oxen of Helios, the Sun God, and  he took away the day of their  homecoming. From some point here,  goddess, daughter of Zeus, speak, and  begin our story. Of that versatile man, O Muse, tell me the story,  How he wandered both long and far after sacking The city of holy Troy. May were the towns  He saw and many the men whose minds he knew,  And many were the woes his stout heart suffered at sea  As he fought to return alive with living comrades.  Them he could not save, though much he longed to,  For through their own thoughtless greed they died -- blind fools  Who slaughtered the Sun's own cattle, Hyperion's herd,  For food, and so by him were kept from returning.  Of all these things, O Goddess, daughter of Zeus,  Beginning wherever you swish, tell even us. Sing in me, Muse, and through me tell the story      of that man skilled in all ways of contending, the wanderer, harried for years on end, after he plundered the stronghold on the proud height of Troy.                                 He saw the townlands and learned the minds of many distant men, and weathered many bitter nights and days in his deep heart at sea, while he fought only to save his life, to bring his shipmates home.      But not by will nor valor could he save them, for their own recklessness destroyed them all-- children and fools, they killed and feasted on the cattle of Lord Hêlios, the Sun, and he who moves all day through heaven took from their eyes the dawn of their return. Of these adventures, Muse, daughter of Zeus, tell us in our time, lift up great song again. Tell me, Muse, about the man of many turns, who many  Ways wandered when he had sacked Troy's holy citadel; He saw the cities of many men, and he knew their thought;  On the ocean he suffered many pains within his heart,  Striving for his life and his companions' return.  But he did not save his companions, though he wanted to:  They lost their own lives because of their recklessness.  The fools, they devoured the cattle of Hyperion,  The Sun, and he took away the day of their return.  Begin the tale somewhere for us also, goddess, daughter of Zeus. Goddess of song, teach me the story of a hero.       This was the man of wide-ranging spirit who had sacked the sacred town of Troy and who wandered afterwards long and far.Many were those cities he viewed and whose minds he came to know, many the troubles that vexed his heart as he sailed the seas, labouring to save himself and to bring his comrades home. But his comrades he could not keep from ruin, strive as he might; they perished instead by their own presumptuousness. Fools, they devoured the cattle of Hyperion, and he, the sun-god, cut off from them the day of their homecoming.       Goddess, daughter of Zeus, to me in turn impart some knowledge of all these things, beginning where you will.  Muse, tell me of a man – a man of much resource, who was madeto wander far and long, after he had sacked the sacred city of Troy. Many were the men whose lands he saw and came to know their thinking, many too the miseries at sea which he suffered in his heart as he sought to win his own life and the safe return of his companions. They perished through their own arrant folly – the fools, they ate the cattle of Hyperion the Sun, and he took away the day of their return.    Start the story where you will, goddess, daughter of Zeus, and share it now with us.Muse, tell me of the man of many wiles,  the man who wandered many paths of exile after he sacked Troy's sacred citadel.  He saw the cities—mapped the minds—of many;  and on the sea, his spirit suffered every  adversity—to keep his life intact,  to bring his comrades back. In that last task,  his will was firm and fast, and yet he failed:  he could not save his comrades. Fools, they foiled  themselves: they ate the oxen of the Sun,  the herd of Hélios Hypérion;  the lord of light requited their transgression—  he took away the day of their return.  Muse, tell us of these matters. Daughter of Zeus,  my starting point is any point you choose. Tell me, Muse of that resourceful  man who was driven to wander far and wide after he had sacked the  holy citadel of Troy. He saw the  cities of many people and he learnt  their ways. He suffered great  anguish on the high seas in his  struggles to preserve life and  bring his comrades home. But he  failed to save those comrades,  in spite of all his efforts. It  was their own transgression that  brought them to their doom, for in  their folly they devoured the oxen  of Hyperion the Sun-god and he  saw to it that they would never  return. Tell us this story,  goddess daughter of Zeus,  beginning at whatever point you  will. Sing to me of the man, Muse, the man of twists and turns driven time and again off course, once he had plundered the hallowed heights of Troy. Many cities of men he saw and learned their minds, many pains he suffered, heartsick on the open sea, fighting to save his life and bring his comrades home. But he could not save them from disaster, hard as he strove— the recklessness of their own ways destroyed them all, the blind fools, they devoured the cattle of the Sun and the Sungod blotted out the day of their return. Launch out on his story, Muse, daughter of Zeus, start from where you will—sing for our time too. Tell me, O Muse, of a man of resourceful spirit who wandered Far, having taken by storm Troy's sacred city and sacked it. Many the men whose cities he saw, whose thoughts he discovered; Many the grievous troubles he suffered at sea in his spirit, Striving to save his life and restore his friends to their homeland. Yet he failed in the end to save his friends by his efforts. By their folly they perished, by their own folly and blindness, Fools, who elected to feed on great Hyperion's oxen; So that God of the Sun denied their day of returning. Tell us the tale, goddess, daughter of Zeus, and choose the beginning. Tell me, Muse, of the versatile man who was driven off course many times after he had sacked the holy citadel of Troy.Many were the  peoples whose cities he saw, and  whose minds he got to know; and at  sea many were the pains he felt in  his heart as he tried to secure his own  life and his comrades’ return home.  Even so he did not save them, much  as he wanted to. Instead they perished  through their own outrageous, foolish  men who ate up the cattle of Hyperion  the Sun; and he took from them the day  of their homecoming. From some point  or other, goddess, daughter of Zeus,   tell us too about these things.  Speak, Memory –                                    Of the cunning hero The wanderer, blown off course time and again After he plundered Troy's sacred heights.                                                            Speak Of all the cities he saw, the minds he grasped,  The suffering deep in his heart at sea As he struggled to survive and bring his men home But could not save them, hard as he tried – The fools – destroyed by their own recklessness When they ate the oxen of Hyperion the Sun, And that god snuffed out their day of return.                                 Of these things,  Speak, Immortal One, And tell the tale once more in our time. Muse, speak to me now of that resourceful man who wandered far and wide after ravaging the sacred citadel of Troy. He came to see many people’s cities, where he learned their customs, while on the sea his spirit suffered many torments, as he fought to save his life and lead his comrades home. But though he wanted to, he could not rescue them— they all died from their own stupidity, the fools. They feasted on the cattle of Hyperion, god of the sun—that’s why he snatched away their chance                       of getting home someday. So now, daughter of Zeus,                                      tell us his story, starting anywhere you wish. Tell me, Muse, of the man versatile and resourceful, who wandered many a sea-mile after he ransacked Troy’s holy city. Many the men whose towns he observed, whose minds he discovered, many the pains in his heart he suffered, traversing the seaway, fighting for his own life and a way back home for his comrades.      Not even so did he save his companions, as much as he wished to, for by their own mad recklessness they were brought to destruction, childish fools–they decided to eat up the cows of the High Lord, Helios: he then took from the men their day of returning. Even for us, holy daughter of Zeus, start there to recount this. Tell me, Muse, of that man of many resources, who wandered far and wide, after sacking the holy citadel of Troy. Many the men whose cities he saw, whose ways he learned. Many the sorrows he suffered at sea, while trying to bring himself and his friends back alive. Yet despite his wishes he failed to save them, because of their own un-wisdom, foolishly eating the cattle of Helios, the Sun, so the god denied them their return. Tell us of these things, beginning where you will, Goddess, Daughter of Zeus. The man, my Muse, resourceful, driven a long way after he sacked the holy city of Trojans: tell me all the men’s cities he saw and the men’s minds, how often he suffered heartfelt pain on the broad sea, striving for life and a way back home for his war friends. Yet he saved no friends, much as he longed to: they lost their lives through their own reckless abandon, fools who ate the cattle of Helios the Sun-God. Huperion seized the day they might have arrived home.   Tell us, Goddess, daughter of Zeus, start in your own place. Speak through me, O Muse, of that man of many devices who wandered much once he'd sacked the sacred citadel of Troy. He saw the cities of many men                      and knew their minds, suffering many sorrows in order to win back his life-soul and the return of his companions. In the end he failed to save them, in spite of his longing to do so, for through their own heedlessness they perished. Fools--who ate the cows of Helios-Hyperion, and the day of their return was taken from them. Of these matters, goddess, daughter of Zeus, speak through us beginning wherever you will. Sing to me, Muse, of that endlessly cunning man who was blown off course to the ends of the earth, in the years after he plundered Troy. He passed through the cities of many people and learned how they thought, and he suffered many bitter hardships upon the high seas as he tried to save his own life and bring his companions back to their home. But however bravely he struggled, he could not rescue them, fools that they were—their own recklessness brought disaster upon them all; they slaughtered and ate the cattle of Hélios, so the sun god destroyed them and blotted out their homecoming. Goddess, daughter of Zeus, begin now, wherever you wish to, and tell the story again, for us. Sing to me of the resourceful man, O Muse, who wandered far after he had sacked the sacred city of Troy. He saw the cities of many men and learned their minds. He suffered many pains on the sea in his spirit, seeking to save his life and the homecoming of his companions. But even so he could not save his companions, though he wanted to, for they perished of their own folly—the fools! They ate the cattle of Helios Hyperion, who took from them the day of their return. Of these matters, beginning where you want, O daughter of Zeus, tell to us. Tell me, Muse, of the man of many turns, who was driven far and wide after he had sacked the sacred city of Troy. Many were the men whose cities he saw, and learnt their minds, many the sufferings on the open sea he endured in his heart, struggling for his own life and his companions' homecoming. Even so he could not protect them, though he desired it, since they perished by reason of their own recklessness, the fools, because they ate the cattle of the Sun, Hyperion, and he took away the day of their homecoming. Tell us, too, goddess daughter of Zeus, starting from where you will. Tell me about a complicated man. Muse, tell me how he wandered and was lost when he had wrecked the holy town of Troy, and where he went, and who he met, the pain he suffered in the storms at sea, and how he worked to save his life and bring his men back home. He failed to keep them safe; poor fools, they ate the Sun God's cattle, and the god kept them from home. Now goddess, child of Zeus, tell the old story for our modern times. The man, Muse—tell me about that resourceful man, who wandered far and wide, when he'd sacked Troy's sacred citadel: many men's townships he saw, and learned their ways of thinking, many the griefs he suffered at heart on the open sea, battling for his own life and his comrades' homecoming. Yet no way could he save his comrades, much though he longed to— it was through their own blind recklessness that they perished, the fools, for they slaughtered the cattle of Hēlios the sun god and ate them: for that he took from them their day of returning. Tell us this tale, goddess, child of Zeus; start anywhere in it!
