A Bible dictionary is a reference work containing encyclopedic entries related to the Bible, typically concerning people, places, customs, doctrine and Biblical criticism. Bible dictionaries can be scholarly or popular in tone. The first dictionary of the Bible in English was the Christian Dictionarie (1612) of Thomas Wilson.
