Christian interpolation is a subsidiary category of scribal interpolation in manuscript transmission. In textual criticism the term generally refers to the specific phenomena of textual insertion and textual damage to Jewish sources text during Christian scribal transmission, but may also refer to possible interpolation in secular Roman texts, such as the case of Tacitus on Christ. Notable disputed examples in the works of Josephus include Josephus' sections on John the Baptist, which is widely accepted,  and on Jesus of Nazareth, which is widely regarded as at best damaged.  Notable examples among the body of texts known as Old Testament pseudepigrapha include the disputed authenticity of Similitudes of Enoch and 4 Ezra which in the form transmitted by Christian scribal traditions contain arguably later Christian understanding of terms such as Son of Man.   Other texts suffering significant Christian interpolation include the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs,  the Sibylline Oracles and so on.
