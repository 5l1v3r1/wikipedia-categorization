A presentation copy is a copy of a book that has been dedicated, illustrated, or signed (without request) by the author, or a book that was a gift from the author.     An inscribed copy, by contrast, is one signed by the author at the book owner's request. Presentation copies are generally more valuable and rarer than inscribed copies.
