Jólabókaflóðið (Icelandic for "Yule book flood") is the annual release of new books in Iceland occurring in the months before Christmas,  a national publishing tradition for new titles. Newly published books are listed in a yearly compilation called bókatíðindi ("book news") that is distributed to all households for free; the total number of new books published was about 800 in 2007  and 760 in 2008.  A further ramification of the custom stems from both Iceland's centuries-long literary tradition, and strict WWII currency restrictions which limited the amount of imported giftware. Given that restrictions on imported paper were more lenient than on other products, books became a massively popular Christmas gift, and indeed the default gift, and thus the custom was established for the settling in and of the reading of said books.
