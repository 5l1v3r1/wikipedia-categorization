The Merle Curti Award is awarded annually by the Organization of American Historians for the best book in American social and/or American intellectual history.    A committee of 5 members of the Organization of American Historians chooses the winners from published monographs submitted by the author(s). Committee members represent the entire spectrum of American history and serve a one-year term. Beginning with the awards of 2004, the Committee may select 1 book "winner" in American intellectual history, 1 book "winner" in American social history, and may list other "finalists" in each field. "Winners" split a $1000 cash award.   Although not explicitly stated, "American" refers to the "United States of America" alone.
