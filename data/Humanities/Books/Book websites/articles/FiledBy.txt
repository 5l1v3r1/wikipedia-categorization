FiledBy was a social cataloging website for content creators (i.e. book authors, illustrators, photographers, and artists), and FiledBy, Inc. offered online marketing solutions for both authors and publishers.  FiledBy, Inc. was co-founded in 2008 by Peter Clifton and Mike Shatzkin.   Launched in March 2009, FiledBy had over 3 million author and contributor websites and over 8 million books in its database.  FiledBy offered both free and premium author websites with many tools and features designed for authors,  and allowed authors to create a blog, post events and appearances, communicate with readers and other authors, build a "What I'm Reading" list, post a resume, and add and edit book descriptions.  FiledBy also had a pre-publication feature that allows both first time and published authors to build a pre-publication website to promote forthcoming books before they are released.
