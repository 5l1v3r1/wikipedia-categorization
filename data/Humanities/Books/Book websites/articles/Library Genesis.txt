Library Genesis or LibGen is a search engine for articles and books on various topics,  which allows free access to content that is otherwise paywalled or not digitized elsewhere.  Among others, it carries PDFs of content from Elsevier's ScienceDirect web-portal.  In 2015, the website became involved in a legal case when Elsevier accused it of providing pirate access to articles and books.  LibGen is reported to be registered in both Russia and Amsterdam, making it unclear which legislation applies,   and whether defendants will show up in a United States court hearing.  LibGen is blocked by a number of ISPs in the United Kingdom,  but such DNS-based blocks are claimed to do little to deter access.  In late October 2015, the District Court for the Southern District of New York ordered LibGen to shut down and to suspend use of the domain name (libgen.org),  but the site is accessible through alternate domains.   As of  5 June 2018,[update] Library Genesis states that its database contains more than 2.7 million books and 58 million science magazine files.
