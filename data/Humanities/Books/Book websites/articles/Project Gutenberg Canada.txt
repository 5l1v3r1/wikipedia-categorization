Project Gutenberg Canada, also known as Project Gutenburg of Canada, is a Canadian digital library founded July 1, 2007. Their website allows Canadian residents to create e-texts and download books that are otherwise not in the public domain in other countries.  It is not formally affiliated with the original Project Gutenberg, though both share the common objective of making public domain books available for free to the general public as e-books. Project Gutenburg Canada primarily focuses on works by Canadian authors or about Canada, as well as works in Canadian French.  Distributed Proofreaders Canada began contributing ebooks to Project Gutenberg Canada when launched on December 1, 2007. In Canada, the copyright period for works is 50 years after the year the author has died. Therefore, if the book was published during the author's lifetime and the author died 51 years ago or more, the book is in the Canadian public domain. Project Gutenberg Canada has received permission to redistribute books still under copyright in some cases. Some authors whose works have entered the public domain in Canada and are thus available on Project Gutenberg Canada are A. A. Milne, Walter de la Mare, Sheila Kaye-Smith, Amy Carmichael, Gertrude Lawrence, Marshall Broomhall, Lilias Trotter, Laura Ingalls Wilder, Isobel Kuhn, and George Orwell.
