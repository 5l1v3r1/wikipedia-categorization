The Lonely Boys (in Swedish, ”De ensamma pojkarna”) is a fiction book by Swedish author Mats Olsson about a young rhythm'n'pop band from the south of Sweden in 1965. Per Gessle (of Roxette fame) was asked by Mats Olsson to write a soundtrack to follow the book, and so the band "The Lonely Boys" came into existence and the debut album by this 1965 fictitious band was released in December 1995. The band went to great lengths to make the sound authentic 1960s; from the lyrical content (Why did Adam have to fall in love with Eve) to the authentic instruments and amplifiers used in the recording process. The album is set out as two sides of an LP (although it was available on a promotional LP in Sweden), including crackles of the needle on the turntable and a pause in between the two sides as the record is turned over. The Lonely Boys consists of: There are 14 songs on the album, with the only cover version being "So Much In Love", which was written by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards of The Rolling Stones (although the Stones never recorded a version, The Inmates did).
