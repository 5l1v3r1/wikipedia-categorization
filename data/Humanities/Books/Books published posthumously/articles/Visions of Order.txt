Visions of Order (1964) is a posthumously-published work by conservative scholar Richard M. Weaver which argues that Western culture is in decline because many of its intellectuals refuse to believe in an underlying order of thingsâ€”in the way things are, irrespective of beliefs about them. More specific targets of Weaver's wrath in this book include: the theory of biological evolution, public education, total wars, the immanentizing of social ideals, and an over-emphasis on function over status.
