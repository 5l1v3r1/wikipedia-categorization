Johnny Panic and the Bible of Dreams is a collection of short stories by Sylvia Plath. It was posthumously published in 1977 as a collection of thirteen short stories, including the title story. As more of Plath's work was unearthed down the years, a second edition was published with many new stories. The second edition is split into four parts, and includes many new stories, some of which were very personal to Plath. As Plath's husband at the time of her death in 1963, fellow poet and writer Ted Hughes managed the publication and distribution of all her unpublished works, including her poetry. The English Band Tears for Fears has a song named after this work.
