Contre Sainte-Beuve (French: [kɔ̃tʁ sɛ̃t bœv], "Against Sainte-Beuve") is an unfinished book of essays written by Marcel Proust between 1895 and 1900 and first published posthumously in 1954. The book was discovered, with its pages in order, amongst Proust's papers after his death. It consists of several essays, three of which refute the body of work written by Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve, a French literary critic active in the early to mid-nineteenth century.
