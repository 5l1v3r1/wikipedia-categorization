Doctor Dolittle's Puddleby Adventures is a Doctor Dolittle book written by Hugh Lofting. The book is a posthumous collection of stories that Lofting originally wrote during the 1920s for the Herald Tribune Syndicate but here first included in book form. The book originally contained two introductory pieces followed by eight Doctor Dolittle stories by Hugh Lofting: Those marked â€  are omitted in recent reprintings for no given reason. The first four stories may be read at the beginning of Doctor Dolittle's Garden. "The Green Breasted Martins" follows Chapter XII in The Story of Doctor Dolittle. "The Crested Screamers" and "The Lost Boy" are to be placed in that order within Part One, Chapter 12 of Doctor Dolittle's Caravan. "The Story of the Maggot" is given a greatly reduced summary at the conclusion to early printings of Part Two, Chapter 4 of Doctor Dolittle's Garden.
