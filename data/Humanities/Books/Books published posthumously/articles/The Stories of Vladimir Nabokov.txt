The Stories of Vladimir Nabokov (in some British editions, The Collected Stories) is a posthumous collection of every known short story that Vladimir Nabokov ever wrote, with the exception of "The Enchanter". The thirteen stories not previously published in English are translated by the author's son, Dmitri Nabokov. The collection was first published in America by Alfred A. Knopf in 1995. The collection includes 65 stories (including one that was long considered lost, but discovered shortly before the latest edition of the volume).
