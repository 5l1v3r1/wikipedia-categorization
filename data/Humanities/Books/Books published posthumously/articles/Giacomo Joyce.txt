Giacomo Joyce is a posthumously-published work by Irish writer James Joyce. Written in 1914, following the publication of Dubliners,  it was published by Faber and Faber from sixteen handwritten pages by Joyce. In the free-form love poem, presented in the guise of a series of notes, Joyce attempts to penetrate the mind of a "dark lady", the object of an illicit love affair. "Giacomo" is the Italian form of the author's forename, James.
