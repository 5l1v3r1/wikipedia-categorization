Horton and the Kwuggerbug and More Lost Stories is an anthology of children's stories written and illustrated by Dr. Seuss, published posthumously by Random House in 2014. The four stories in this book were originally published as installments of a monthly column that Dr. Seuss wrote for Redbook during the 1950s.  Dr. Seuss died in 1991, but the stories were later rediscovered by Seuss scholar Charles D. Cohen.  The four stories included in the book are as follows: Michael Taube of The Washington Times was enthusiastic about the book, writing, "If you loved Dr. Seuss as a child (and as an adult), these little-known stories will bring back many fond memories."  The reviewer for Publishers Weekly was more critical, stating, "By no means gems, these archives suggest how Geisel tinkered with characters, developed his signature tetrameter, and commented on ethical issues, circa 1950."
