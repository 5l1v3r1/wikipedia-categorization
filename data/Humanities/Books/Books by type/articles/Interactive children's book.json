Whether the hidden object is a hard to spot character or an item specified by the author in a rhyming list, is subject to the book or possibly the series of books it belongs to.  Although it is not standard, these types of interactive children\u2019s books are sometimes published with a common theme such as Christmas or life on the farm.  Children can interactively experience a selective number of these books as early as age four and beginning at a pre-kindergarten grade level, depending on how easily the hidden objectives can be located.  There are several notable authors and illustrators at the frontline assisting their audiences\u2019 development of interactive reading skills in hidden object picture books:\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Martin_Handford_Where.E2.80.99s_Wally.3F\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Martin_Handford_Where\u2019s_Wally?\">Martin Handford Where\u2019s Wally?</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Interactive_children%27s_book&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Martin Handford Where\u2019s Wally?\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>British illustrator <a href=\"/wiki/Martin_Handford\" title=\"Martin Handford\">Martin Handford</a> is credited with the conception of the <a href=\"/wiki/Where%27s_Wally%3F\" title=\"Where&#39;s Wally?\">Where's Wally?</a> series.  Despite the series christened title, his hidden picture books are more recognizable under the North American franchise\u2019s version of the character, Waldo.  The purpose of Handford\u2019s hidden object picture books is for children of all ages to identify Wally in a specified location throughout his \u201cworld-wide hike.\u201d Although various activities and outfit similarities easily camouflage the character\u2019s whereabouts, Wally always wears glasses and carries a walking stick and is famous for his outfit of a red and white horizontally striped shirt, blue trousers and a bobble hat.\n</p><p>The first book in Handford\u2019s series, originally titled <i>Where's Wally?</i>, was published in 1987. The book was soon followed by the release of <a href=\"/wiki/Where%27s_Wally_Now%3F\" title=\"Where&#39;s Wally Now?\">Where's Wally Now?</a> (1988) and <a href=\"/wiki/Where%27s_Wally%3F:_The_Fantastic_Journey\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Where&#39;s Wally?: The Fantastic Journey\">Where's Wally?: The Fantastic Journey</a> (1989). The books became extremely popular and were translated into many languages.  The trademark of Wally was adopted in 28 countries and the character is often given a different name and personality in the translations.\n</p><p>As more books were released the cast of characters grew as well - including Wizard Whitebeard, Wilma, Wenda, <a href=\"/wiki/Woof_(Where%27s_Waldo)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Woof (Where&#39;s Waldo)\">Woof</a>, Odlaw and the Waldo Watchers.  More Waldo books followed - such as <a href=\"/wiki/Where%27s_Waldo_in_Hollywood%3F\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Where&#39;s Waldo in Hollywood?\">Where's Waldo in Hollywood?</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Where%27s_Waldo%3F:_The_Wonder_Book\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Where&#39;s Waldo?: The Wonder Book\">Where's Waldo?: The Wonder Book</a> (1997), <a href=\"/wiki/Where%27s_Waldo%3F:_The_Great_Picture_Hunt\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Where&#39;s Waldo?: The Great Picture Hunt\">Where's Waldo?: The Great Picture Hunt</a> (2006).\n</p><p>Waldo became a huge pop culture sensation in the early 1990s.

Below the picture, Marzollo involves readers with a riddle asking them to locate specific items within Wick\u2019s photograph.  Wick\u2019s photographs are highly regarded for their expressive quality.\n</p><p>The series originated with I Spy: A Book of Picture Riddles (1992) and grew to include I Spy: Christmas (1992), I Spy: Fun House (1993), I Spy: Mystery (1993), I Spy: Fantasy (1994), I Spy: School Days (1995), I Spy: Spooky Night (1996), and I Spy: Treasure Hunt (1999).\n</p><p>A subsequent and more challenging series was begun in 1997 with I Spy: Super Challenger!

Touch-and-feel books, or texturized books, fall in this area. The prime age for touch and feel books is from toddler-age to preschool. Because these books are aimed specifically at helping children develop knowledge while increasing the use of their senses, appeal is lost to older generations who more than likely already possess the skills being taught. One of the key advantages to teaching senses and vocabulary through the use of touch and feel books is the connection a child can gain by instantly being rewarded with the texture that the word describes.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> In recent years, touch-and-feel books have gone to a new level with the creation of fun new ways for younger children to interact with books such as musical \"bath books\" and \"finger puppet books\". Most, but not all, of these books are also \"board books\", which are made entirely out of hard pages. Making the pages out of a hard material provides for durability, allowing them to resist whatever they may contact along with the young readers. Bath books can be taken into the tub because of their floatable and waterproof pages. A few of the top touch and feel book publishers are Dorling Kindersley, Usborne, Macmillan, and Lamaze.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Some_touch_and_feel_books\">Some touch and feel books</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Interactive_children%27s_book&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10\" title=\"Edit section: Some touch and feel books\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>-Pat the Bunny, by Dorothy Kunhardt <br />\n-Usborne's \"That's not my...\" series <br />\n-Dorling Kindersley's Touch and Feel series <br />\n-The Rainbow Fish, by Marcus Pfister <br />\n-Macmillan's Cloth Book Series, by Roger Priddy <br />\n-\"Little\" Finger Puppet Book Series.

These books provide 3-D illustrations made of unfolding paper that allow for the child to feel as if the book is coming to life.  First created in the mid-thirteenth century, they were originally not intended for children until publisher <a href=\"/wiki/Robert_Sayer\" title=\"Robert Sayer\">Robert Sayer</a> created <i>Harlquinade</i> in 1765.  With his creating of a \u201clift-the-flap\u201d book, he gave children a way to truly become involved with what they are reading.  From then, several other authors, such as <a href=\"/wiki/William_Grimaldi\" title=\"William Grimaldi\">William Grimaldi</a>, designed their version of the pop-up book depicting elaborate scenes from page to page that allowed for the reader to determine the outcome of the story.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\nThe pop-up book has evolved from a seemingly simplistic idea to one of more sophistication, as well as complication.  They have grown to be a genre that delights, intrigues, and educates children of all ages.\n</p><p>One key person in the pop-up book phenomenon is Waldo Hunt, who was the first to develop these books in the United States.<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> He found joy and creativity in the idea of creating a pop-up image in a book.  He was the true advocate and mastermind behind their conception and popularity.\n</p><p>Pop-up books are common enough to be found in your local library, bookstore, classroom, or likely even your own bookshelf. There are several examples of these kinds of books, but some famous ones to check out are: Christmas in New York by Chuck Fischer, Star Wars: A Pop-Up Guide to the Galaxy by Matthew Reinhart, and The Amazing Pop-Up Geography Book by Kate Petty.  Pop-up books can range from very simplistic 3-D illustrations to more intricate and detailed presentations depending upon the topic of the book, its author and illustrator, as well as the age of the audience they are appealing to.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Digitized_learning_books\">Digitized learning books</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Interactive_children%27s_book&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12\" title=\"Edit section: Digitized learning books\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Many children\u2019s interactive books have been enhanced through the use of technology. The earliest examples of this were books that had sound effects- a bar on the side of the book that had buttons corresponding with pictures in the story. When the icon appeared in the story, the reader could press a button on the side to hear the sound effect. These are called \u201csound books.\u201d Books that had accompanying cassette tapes (or even CDs), usually known as books on tape, are another early example of this.\n</p><p>Once computers became more prevalent, CD-ROM versions of books became popular. These were programs that put books on the computer screen, enabling children to click their way through various words and pictures in the story and have it come alive. The technology was fairly limited, however, and not widespread as only children with access to a PC (and the knowledge to use it) could take advantage of it.<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The next big step in this technology was <a href=\"/wiki/LeapPad\" title=\"LeapPad\">Leap Frog\u2019s Leap Pad.</a> The Leap Pad makes regular books interactive by enabling children to hear a word aloud, have the story read to them, have words and sounds spelled for them, play interactive learning games on many pages and more, simply by touching the included \u201cpen\u201d to different places on the page.<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> The system is divided into \u201cLeap Levels\u201d for different-aged children and includes everything from picture books to chapter books, with separate Leap Pads corresponding to each level. There is also a unit that allows new content to be downloaded from Leap Frog\u2019s Web site. The technology of the Leap Pad continued evolving, and Leap Frog next came out with the <a href=\"/wiki/Tag_(LeapFrog)\" title=\"Tag (LeapFrog)\">Tag (LeapFrog)</a>. Instead of a Pad unit where books must be inserted, the Tag system is essentially a \u201cpen\u201d onto which books can be downloaded. Then, the pen can be scanned across the corresponding book to read it aloud, unlock activities and more.\nThe goal for these products is to help children get more out of their books and learn to read, according to Leap Frog.  Leap Frog even has its own publishing company, Leap Frog Press, which creates books specifically designed for its system. The products are not cheap, though- the Leap Pad can cost as much as $80. The Tag is usually sold in gift packs that run anywhere from $20 to $75. Books for each are sold separately and typically cost $12 or more.\nOf course, Leap Frog is not the only company with products like the Leap Pad or Tag system that use technology to enhance the reading experience for children. However, it was one of the first, and now several companies have copied the idea and made similar products.\n</p><p>The newest advance in interactive children's books reflects the recent popularity of <a href=\"/wiki/Amazon_Kindle\" title=\"Amazon Kindle\">Amazon's Kindle.</a> There are now a plethora of e-book sites that place children's picture books, along with LeapFrog-like sound effects and word pronunciation, completely online-often for free.
