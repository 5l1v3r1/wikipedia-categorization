Australian yearbooks function as an annual magazine for the school body, with a significant focus on objectively reporting the events that occurred during the schooling year. They cover various topics including academic, sporting, extra-curricular, student life and other activities. Yearbook staff predominantly consist of only one or two school teachers who serve as editors in chief. Australian school yearbooks are predominantly created on <a href=\"/wiki/A4_paper_size\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"A4 paper size\">A4 paper size</a>, featuring a softcover style front-and-back cover, typically 250 or 300 g/m\u00b2 density.

However, top Business schools and Engineering colleges publish custom yearbooks. This is typically created by the final year students of the batch. A yearbook or a memory book would consist of testimonials and common pages such as Directors address and events, festivals picture collages.\n</p><p>Most top schools do create schools magazines which are shared with each student.

Senior photographs are usually larger than those of underclassmen and are sometimes accompanied by text about their accomplishments throughout high school and their future plans.

Often, yearbook staff members will either interview students, teachers and others for comments. Alternative story formats have gained popularity in recent times, allowing stories to be told in visual ways (graphs, charts, polls, timelines, etc.).</li>\n<li><b>Photographs</b>: Every spread that isn't a portrait or an ad spread contains candid shots of students, suitable to the page's topic and theme. Included with the photographs are one or more captions, which describe each picture; these often begin with a <a href=\"/wiki/Lead-in\" title=\"Lead-in\">lead-in</a>.</li></ul>\n<p>In the past, most yearbooks were laid out by hand, with photographs physically cropped and placed on layout boards. The work was tedious, and required multiple deadlines and contact with a yearbook publisher. Today, virtually all yearbooks are published using computers, which allows for shorter deadlines and easier editing. Students typically design pages using a <a href=\"/wiki/Desktop_publishing\" title=\"Desktop publishing\">desktop publishing</a> program, usually <a href=\"/wiki/Adobe_InDesign\" title=\"Adobe InDesign\">Adobe InDesign</a>. Some schools use a proprietary web-based design program belonging to the company that prints the book.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Publication\">Publication</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Yearbook&amp;action=edit&amp;section=22\" title=\"Edit section: Publication\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"U.S._printing_companies\">U.S. printing companies</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Yearbook&amp;action=edit&amp;section=23\" title=\"Edit section: U.S. printing companies\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>Yearbook printing companies usually have representatives who work with the adviser and staff at each school to assist in the creation of the yearbook.\n</p><p>Yearbook companies that use off-set printing require that groups of pages be sent periodically, rather than all at once, to the plant. This is done to stagger the work required to complete yearbooks for all the schools they cover. After the editors review each page and make changes, the pages are sent to the yearbook plant, usually via the <a href=\"/wiki/Internet\" title=\"Internet\">Internet</a>. Yearbook companies that use digital printing methods may only require one submission since the entire book is printed at once.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>If the proofing process is not performed on-line, the adviser and editors receive proofs (typically full size prints) about a week or so after the submission of pages. This gives the school a final opportunity to make adjustments or changes. After all the proofs have been returned to the printing company the requested corrections are made, the books are printed, bound, and then sent to the school for distribution.\n</p><p>A number of educational institutions and yearbook printing companies operate camps and summer sessions at which student yearbook personnel can learn or polish the skills they need in their work.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Distribution\">Distribution</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Yearbook&amp;action=edit&amp;section=24\" title=\"Edit section: Distribution\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Often, yearbooks are distributed at the end of a school year to allow students, teachers, and other members of the school to obtain the books and signatures/personal messages from classmates. In the U.S., those that distribute at this time may publish a supplemental insert with photographs from spring sports and milestone events (such as <a href=\"/wiki/Prom\" title=\"Prom\">prom</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Graduation\" title=\"Graduation\">graduation</a>) and other important events. Many schools at which yearbooks are distributed at or before the end of a school year have a tradition of having students sign and leave notes on each other's yearbooks.\n</p><p>Some schools distribute yearbooks after the end of the school year\u2014such as in July, at <a href=\"/wiki/Homecoming\" title=\"Homecoming\">homecoming</a> (US) in October or another designated time in order to include year-end activities.

Students want to preserve their sweet memories of their childhood and teen years. India is also seeing a high growth of students   proute moving to study in the International board.

While a traditional paper yearbook may contain 300+ pages, a digital yearbook can contain unlimited pages. The end product of a digital yearbook can be a CD-ROM, a DVD or is captured in an eBook format. The first CD-ROM yearbook was created by students at South Eugene High School in 1990.<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>A digital yearbook page, also known as a <a href=\"/wiki/Dyp_(app)\" title=\"Dyp (app)\">dyp</a>, makes an existing yearbook interactive using Portrait Recognition Technology.
