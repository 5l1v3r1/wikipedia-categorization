{"parse":{"title":"Photoplay edition","pageid":14023926,"revid":705306953,"text":{"*":"<div class=\"mw-parser-output\"><p><br />\n<b>Photoplay edition</b> refers to movie tie-in <a href=\"/wiki/Book\" title=\"Book\">books</a> of the <a href=\"/wiki/Silent_film\" title=\"Silent film\">silent film</a> and early sound era at a time when <a href=\"/wiki/Motion_pictures\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Motion pictures\">motion pictures</a> were known as \"photoplays\". Typically, photoplay editions were reprints of novels additionally illustrated with scenes from a film production. Less typically, photoplay editions were novelizations of films, where the film script was fictionalized in narrative form. Today, vintage photoplay editions are sought after by film buffs, bibliophiles, and collectors.\n</p><p>The first photoplay editions were published around 1912, and as a genre, they reached their height in the 1920s and 1930s. Thousands of different titles were issued in the United States. Most photoplays were published in hardback by companies like <a href=\"/wiki/Grosset_%26_Dunlap\" title=\"Grosset &amp; Dunlap\">Grosset &amp; Dunlap</a> or A.L. Burt, and some in soft cover by companies like Jacobsen Hodgkinson. Similar movie related books were also published in England, France and elsewhere.\n</p><p>Typically, photoplay editions of the 1920s and 1930s contained stills and/or a dust jacket featuring artwork or actors from a film. Deluxe editions might also contain a special binding, illustrated end papers, or rarely, a written introduction by the star of the film. Sometimes, the spine or cover of the book will note the edition is a \"photoplay edition.\"\n</p><p>Illustrated movie tie-in books continued to be published though the 1940s, 1950s, and into the 1960s. Today, novels published in conjunction with the release of a film will often feature an actor or actress on the cover of the book, but without the interior illustrations.\n</p><p>Today, the most sought after photoplays are those tie-in editions for favorite films such as <i>Dracula</i>, <i>Frankenstein</i> and <i>King Kong</i>, or lost films such as <i>London After Midnight</i>. Other collectors search for books featuring individuals stars, like <a href=\"/wiki/Louise_Brooks\" title=\"Louise Brooks\">Louise Brooks</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Rudolph_Valentino\" title=\"Rudolph Valentino\">Rudolph Valentino</a>. Published by Grosset &amp; Dunlap in 1927, <i>The General</i> is today one of the most sought after of photoplay books. Not only did the Joseph Warren novel make its first appearance in print as a photoplay, but the book is the only photoplay edition to feature film star <a href=\"/wiki/Buster_Keaton\" title=\"Buster Keaton\">Buster Keaton</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Guidebooks\">Guidebooks</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Photoplay_edition&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Guidebooks\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:172px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Photoplayedition.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/80/Photoplayedition.jpg/170px-Photoplayedition.jpg\" width=\"170\" height=\"264\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/80/Photoplayedition.jpg 1.5x\" data-file-width=\"253\" data-file-height=\"393\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Photoplayedition.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Emil Petaja's <i>Photoplay Edition</i> was the first book published on the subject.</div></div></div>\n<p><i>Photoplay Edition</i> (SISU, 1975), by the noted science fiction and fantasy author <a href=\"/wiki/Emil_Petaja\" title=\"Emil Petaja\">Emil Petaja</a>, was the first book on the subject. Petaja based the book on his collection of photoplays, which at the time of publication numbered more than eight hundred. Petaja had owned many rare examples, including a few autographed by film stars.\n</p><p>Petaja's <i>Photoplay Edition</i> is composed of a checklist of books, with each entry detailing the book's movie title (which sometimes differed from the title of the novel), as well as its author, publisher, date of release, the motion picture company which produced the film, its leading actors, and the number of illustrations included within the book. Illustrating Petaja's guide are dozens of dust jackets and scene stills, each of which graced the original editions. Petaja also offers a short prologue, a longer history of photoplay books, and an anecdotal chapter telling the story of the author's involvement in collecting these books.\n</p><p><i>Photoplay Edition</i> has been surpassed by later, more comprehensive, illustrated guides. These include Arnie Davis' <i>Photoplay Editions and Other Movie Tie-In Books</i> (Mainely Books, 2002), and Rick Miller's <i>Photoplay Editions: A Collector's Guide</i> (McFarland, 2002). Each list more than the 800 examples found in Petaja's pioneering guide. Thomas Mann's <i>Horror and Mystery Photoplay Editions and Magazine Fictionizations</i> (McFarland, 2004) examines genre editions.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Further_reading\">Further reading</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Photoplay_edition&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Further reading\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li>Emil Petaja, <i>Photoplay Edition</i>, San Francisco, California: SISU, 1975</li>\n<li>Moe Wadle, <i>The Movie Tie-In Book: A Collectors Guide to Paperback Movie Editions</i>, Coralville, Iowa: Nostalgia Books, 1994</li>\n<li>Marija Dalbello-Lovric, <i>Verbalizing Silences and the Faces: The Photoplay Novel as a Model of Popular Reading in the Silent Film Era</i>, Paper presented at annual meeting of the History of Authorship, Reading and Publishing, Worcester, MA, July 17\u201321, 1996.</li>\n<li>Arnie Davis, <i>Photoplay Editions and Other Movie Tie-In Books</i>, East Waterboro, Maine: Mainely Books, 2002</li>\n<li>Rick Miller, <i>Photoplay Editions: A Collector's Guide</i>, Jefferson, North Carolina: McFarland, 2002</li>\n<li>Thomas Mann, <i>Horror and Mystery Photoplay Editions and Magazine Fictionizations</i>, Jefferson, North Carolina: McFarland, 2004</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"External_links\">External links</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Photoplay_edition&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: External links\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.pandorasbox.com/books/photoplays.html\">informational webpage displaying examples of Louise Brooks photoplay editions</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.pandorasbox.com/books/photoplays.html\">webpage on Joan Crawford movie-related books</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.minsky.com/garden-of-allah.htm\">informational page about editions of <i>The Garden of Allah</i></a></li></ul>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw2170\nCached time: 20180920090031\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.008 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.016 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 19/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 0/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:14023926-0!canonical and timestamp 20180920090031 and revision id 705306953\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","*":"Book_collecting"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Book"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Buster Keaton"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Emil Petaja"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Grosset & Dunlap"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Louise Brooks"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Motion pictures"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Rudolph Valentino"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Silent film"}],"templates":[],"images":["Photoplayedition.jpg"],"externallinks":["http://www.pandorasbox.com/books/photoplays.html","http://www.minsky.com/garden-of-allah.htm"],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Guidebooks","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Photoplay_edition","byteoffset":2387,"anchor":"Guidebooks"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Further reading","number":"2","index":"2","fromtitle":"Photoplay_edition","byteoffset":3989,"anchor":"Further_reading"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"External links","number":"3","index":"3","fromtitle":"Photoplay_edition","byteoffset":4816,"anchor":"External_links"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Photoplay edition","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q17146002"}]}}
