Each volume contains four or five stories. The volume 1\u20133 omnibus was published with a foreword by Barker's fellow Liverpudlian horror writer <a href=\"/wiki/Ramsey_Campbell\" title=\"Ramsey Campbell\">Ramsey Campbell</a>.\n</p><p>They were published between 1984 and 1985. With the publication of the first volume, Barker became an overnight sensation and was hailed by <a href=\"/wiki/Stephen_King\" title=\"Stephen King\">Stephen King</a> as \"the future of horror\". The book won both the <a href=\"/wiki/British_Fantasy_Award\" title=\"British Fantasy Award\">British</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/World_Fantasy_Award\" title=\"World Fantasy Award\">World Fantasy Awards</a>.\n</p><p>Although undoubtedly horror stories, like most of Barker's work they mix fantasy themes in as well. The unrelentingly bleak tales invariably take place in a contemporary setting, usually featuring <a href=\"/wiki/Everyman\" title=\"Everyman\">everyday people</a> who become embroiled in terrifying or mysterious events. Barker has stated in <i><a href=\"/wiki/Faces_of_Fear_(interview_book)\" title=\"Faces of Fear (interview book)\">Faces of Fear</a></i> that an inspiration for the <i>Books of Blood</i> was when he read <i><a href=\"/wiki/Dark_Forces_(book)\" title=\"Dark Forces (book)\">Dark Forces</a></i> in the early 1980s and realised that a horror story collection need not have any narrow themes, consistent tone or restrictions. The stories could range from the humorous to the truly horrific.\n</p><p>For some editions, each book's cover was illustrated by Clive Barker himself.\n</p><p>Eighteen of the stories in the <i>Books of Blood</i> were adapted by Eclipse Books in the comic series <i><a href=\"/wiki/Tapping_the_Vein_(comic)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Tapping the Vein (comic)\">Tapping the Vein</a></i> as well

Kaufman encounters the killer, a man named Mahogany, and kills him in <a href=\"/wiki/Self-defense\" title=\"Self-defense\">self-defense</a>. The motorman, nonplussed at Mahogany's death, brings the train into a secret station where strange, malformed humanoid creatures board and eat the bodies. It is revealed that the creatures, the \"City Fathers\", have been the secret rulers of New York for centuries, and show Kaufman an immense being further inside the <a href=\"/wiki/Catacombs\" title=\"Catacombs\">catacombs</a>. They then pull out Kaufman's tongue to ensure his silence, recruiting him as the new \"butcher\" devoted to bringing fresh meat to the City Fathers.\n</p><p>A <a href=\"/wiki/The_Midnight_Meat_Train\" title=\"The Midnight Meat Train\">film of the same name</a> was released on 1 August 2008.

The demon is commanded to haunt Jack by <a href=\"/wiki/Beelzebub\" title=\"Beelzebub\">Beelzebub</a>, because one of Jack's ancestors reneged on a pact made with the demon lord. The Yattering is frustrated when its determined efforts to drive Jack insane are answered with good cheer and apparent obliviousness. Unknown to the Yattering, Jack is purposely ignoring the demon in order to simultaneously frustrate it and maintain his own sanity. The Yattering subjects him to increasingly severe torments, including killing his cats and terrorising his family, but these efforts all fail. Eventually Jack tricks the Yattering into violating its orders, allowing Jack to take advantage of a <a href=\"/wiki/Loophole\" title=\"Loophole\">loophole</a> and make the Yattering his slave.\n</p><p>Unusual for Barker's early work, this story is unabashedly comic.

Leroy relies on the <a href=\"/wiki/Soap_opera\" title=\"Soap opera\">soap opera</a> fame of his leading lady, Diane Duvall, to bring in a big audience; however, this is compromised by his affair with Diane and her poor acting skills. A mysterious man with an obscured face, Mr. Lichfield, introduces himself and expresses dissatisfaction with Diane's casting as <a href=\"/wiki/Viola_(Twelfth_Night)\" title=\"Viola (Twelfth Night)\">Viola</a>. On the day of the final rehearsal, Lichfield confronts Diane and states that his wife, Constantia, will play the role on opening night. Diane removes Lichfield's mask to reveal him as an animated corpse. Lichfield kisses Diane, and she slips into a <a href=\"/wiki/Coma\" title=\"Coma\">coma</a>. Constantia takes over the role of Viola while Diane is put in intensive care. Following her \"recovery\", Leroy realises during sex that Diane is <a href=\"/wiki/Undead\" title=\"Undead\">undead</a>, just before she kills him.\n</p><p>The play opens to a packed house. When the house lights are extinguished after the performance, the actors realise that the audience consists entirely of ghosts and decaying corpses. The theatre trustee, newly-dead Tallulah, burns down the theatre. Every living player in the production is killed.

Almost forty thousand people walk as the body of a single giant as tall as a skyscraper. This ritual occurs every ten years, but this time things go wrong and the Podujevo giant collapses, killing tens of thousands of citizens horribly. In shock, the entire population of Popolac goes mad and becomes the giant they are strapped into. Popolac wanders the hills aimlessly. By nightfall many of the people who make up the giant die from exhaustion, but the giant continues walking.\n</p><p>Mick and Judd, two gay men vacationing in the area, come upon the smashed bodies of the Podujevans in a ravine awash with blood. A local man tries to steal their car to catch up with Popolac and reason with it before it collapses and destroys the people who compose it. The man explains the truth of the situation to Mick and Judd, but they do not believe his story. They seek shelter at a remote farm, where Popolac blunders into the farmhouse, killing Judd accidentally. Mick and the elderly couple who own the farmhouse are driven mad with fear. Mick wants to join Popolac. He climbs up the tower of ropes and bodies, and is carried away as it walks into the hills.\n</p><p>A line from this story, \"stale incense, old sweat, and lies,\" appears in the song <i>Sin</i> on the album <i><a href=\"/wiki/Pretty_Hate_Machine\" title=\"Pretty Hate Machine\">Pretty Hate Machine</a></i> by the American industrial band <a href=\"/wiki/Nine_Inch_Nails\" title=\"Nine Inch Nails\">Nine Inch Nails</a>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Volume_Two\">Volume Two</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Books_of_Blood&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: Volume Two\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Dread\">Dread</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Books_of_Blood&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10\" title=\"Edit section: Dread\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>Steve, a young student, becomes acquainted with an older classmate named Quaid, an intellectual who has a morbid fascination with <a href=\"/wiki/Fear\" title=\"Fear\">fear</a>.

D'Amour is recruited by Swann's wife to watch over his body so he can be <a href=\"/wiki/Cremation\" title=\"Cremation\">cremated</a> in line with a letter written before his death. Almost immediately, D'Amour is drawn into a battle with demons from the underworld seeking to claim Swann's body due to a deal he made with them which gave him the magical powers he possessed. With the assistance of Swann's underling Valentin, who is secretly a demon himself, D'Amour fights off the demons desiring Swann's body and manages to cremate it, but not before Swann performs one last magical act. \n</p><p>This story was later adapted by Barker himself into the film <i><a href=\"/wiki/Lord_of_Illusions\" title=\"Lord of Illusions\">Lord of Illusions</a></i>.\n</p>\n<h4><span id=\"On_Jerusalem_Street_.28a_postscript.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"On_Jerusalem_Street_(a_postscript)\">On Jerusalem Street (a postscript)</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Books_of_Blood&amp;action=edit&amp;section=37\" title=\"Edit section: On Jerusalem Street (a postscript)\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>Only included in some UK editions of the <i>Books of Blood</i>, \"On Jerusalem Street\" is a sequel to \"The Book of Blood\" from Volume One told as a sort of wrap-around tale.
