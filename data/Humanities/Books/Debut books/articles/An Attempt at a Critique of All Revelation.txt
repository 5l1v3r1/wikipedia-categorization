An Attempt at a Critique of All Revelation (German: Versuch einer Critik  aller Offenbarung; 1792) was the first published work by Johann Gottlieb Fichte. It was briefly mistaken by the public to be a fourth Critique by Immanuel Kant, and thereby gained Fichte much philosophical fame. In this work, Fichte argued that any revelation in relation to God must be consistent with morality, which was against many aspects of orthodox Christian belief at the time.
