The Book of Mirdad is an allegorical book of philosophy by Lebanese author Mikha'il Na'ima. The book was first published in Lebanon in 1948 and was initially written in English, with Na'ima later translating it into Arabic.  Na'ima initially sought to have the book published in London, where it was rejected for "[advancing] a religion with 'a new dogma'".  In 1973 the book was adapted into a three-act play by Padukone Ramanand.  The book is presented as a series of dialogues between Mirdad, the abbot of a monastery, and his disciples. The Book of Mirdad draws on a variety of philosophies, including that of Leo Tolstoy and Sufi Islam. Through the allegories in the book presented by Mirdad, Na'ima presents several themes and calls for the unity of different people groups in universal love, as well as criticizing materialism and empty religious rituals.   Mirdad's dialogs gives out teachings which show us how it is possible to transform our consciousness and uncover the God within, by dissolving our sense of duality. The Book of Mirdad is ranked among the great religious classics of the twentieth century and a must have constant companion of any spiritual seeker. A reviewer for Philosophy East and West praised the book, citing Na'ima's "power of enthusiasm and persuasion" as a highlight.  The Indian mystic Osho mentioned The Book of Mirdad in his book A Song Without Words, saying that it "can be of immense help if you don't expect, and it is a book worth reading thousands of times."  The Book of Mirdad is considered a masterpiece of spiritual wisdom to rank alongside The Prophet. The book has been compared to John Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress in that both stories are largely allegorical.  The Book of Mirdad has also been compared to Ameen Rihani's The Book of Khalid, with the book being believed to have had an influence on Na'ima's writings.  Na'ima has described the work as the "pinnacle of his thought and a summary of his view of life".
