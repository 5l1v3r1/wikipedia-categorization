The Impossible: The Miraculous Story of a Mother's Faith and Her Child's Resurrection is a Christian novel written by American author Joyce Smith, alongside contributor Ginger Kolbaba. The book, released on November 7, 2017, tells the story of Joyce's 14-year-old son John, who fell through icy Lake Ste. Louise in Missouri.  When Joyce Smith's fourteen-year-old son John fell through an icy Missouri lake one winter morning, she and her family had seemingly lost everything. At the hospital, John lay lifeless for more than sixty minutes. But Joyce was not ready to give up on her son. She mustered all her faith and strength into one force and cried out to God in a loud voice to save him. Miraculously, her son's heart immediately started beating again. In the coming days, John would continue to defy every expert, every case history, and every scientific prediction. Sixteen days after falling through the ice and being clinically dead for an hour, he walked out of the hospital under his own power, completely healed. 20th Century Fox has announced plans to produce a movie adaptation of The Impossible, titled The Breakthrough, working with director Roxann Dawson, executive producer Samuel Rodriguez and producer DeVon Franklin, who has worked on other faith drama titles such as Miracles from Heaven and Heaven Is for Real.  The film is expected to be released April 12, 2019. In March of 2018, it was announced that actor Topher Grace will star as Pastor Jason Noble, and first responder Tommy Shine will be portrayed by Mike Colter.  Actress Chrissy Metz of NBC's This Is Us is set to star as Joyce Smith.
