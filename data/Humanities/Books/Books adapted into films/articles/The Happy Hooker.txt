The Happy Hooker: My Own Story is a best-selling memoir by Xaviera Hollander, a call girl, published in 1971. It sold over 20 million  copies. Robin Moore, who took Hollander's dictations of the book's contents, came up with the title, while Yvonne Dunleavy either transcribed the book  or ghostwrote it.  Hollander's book inspired a series of movies, starting with 1975's The Happy Hooker, which starred Lynn Redgrave.  The film was followed by two sequels: 1977's The Happy Hooker Goes to Washington  and 1980's The Happy Hooker Goes Hollywood.  In the sequels the role of Hollander was played by Joey Heatherton and Martine Beswick respectively.
