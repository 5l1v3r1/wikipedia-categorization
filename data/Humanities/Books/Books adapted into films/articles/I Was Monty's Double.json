The German High Command did plan to have him killed, but Hitler vetoed the plan until he could be sure where the landings would actually take place.\n</p><p>Gibraltar was in reality a hotbed of German agents, and James/Montgomery was spied on by several operatives who were smuggled into Gibraltar specifically to discover what \"Monty\" was up to. James/Montgomery deliberately talked nonsense about non-existent operations and plans, in the hope that the spies would overhear and take such information seriously.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Satires\">Satires</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=I_Was_Monty%27s_Double&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Satires\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Goon_Show\" title=\"The Goon Show\">The Goon Show</a></i> broadcast a parody episode entitled <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://homepages.paradise.net.nz/ajwills/raw/series09/s09e02.html\"><i>I Was Monty's Treble</i></a> on 10 November 1958 (9th series, show 2).</li>\n<li>In 1959, <a href=\"/wiki/Cecil_Parker\" title=\"Cecil Parker\">Cecil Parker</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Leslie_Phillips\" title=\"Leslie Phillips\">Leslie Phillips</a> appeared in a <a href=\"/wiki/Parody\" title=\"Parody\">spoof</a> version, <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Night_We_Dropped_a_Clanger\" title=\"The Night We Dropped a Clanger\">The Night We Dropped a Clanger</a></i> (known as <i>Make Mine a Double</i> in the U.S.), alongside <a href=\"/wiki/Brian_Rix\" title=\"Brian Rix\">Brian Rix</a>.</li>\n<li>The 1961 film <i><a href=\"/wiki/On_the_Double_(film)\" title=\"On the Double (film)\">On the Double</a></i>, starring <a href=\"/wiki/Danny_Kaye\" title=\"Danny Kaye\">Danny Kaye</a>, was also a take-off of <i>I Was Monty's Double</i>, in which Kaye plays the twin roles of the General and the private who (comically but successfully) impersonates him.</li>\n<li>The 1989 <a href=\"/wiki/Jason_Connery\" title=\"Jason Connery\">Jason Connery</a> film <i><a href=\"/wiki/Casablanca_Express\" title=\"Casablanca Express\">Casablanca Express</a></i> freely borrows from the original tale, but with Churchill as the kidnap target. <a href=\"/wiki/Glenn_Ford\" title=\"Glenn Ford\">Glenn Ford</a> appears briefly as a character resembling Gen.
