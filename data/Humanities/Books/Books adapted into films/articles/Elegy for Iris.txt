Elegy for Iris is a 1999 memoir by John Bayley, about his marriage to fellow author Iris Murdoch, who suffered from Alzheimer's disease in her last years. Bayley also wrote two more books about his life with Murdoch, Iris and Her Friends and Widower's House. In 2001, the film Iris was based on Bayley's book. Part of the movie and the book on the life of Iris Murdoch both dealt with her view of marriage, in which she felt it was acceptable for her to engage in adultery. Her husband, John Bayley, knew about her acts of infidelity, especially with one lover in particular. He tolerated it throughout their marriage.
