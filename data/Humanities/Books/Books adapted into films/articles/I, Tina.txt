I, Tina is a 1986 autobiography by rock singer Tina Turner, co-written by MTV news correspondent and music critic Kurt Loder.  It described Turner's story from a girl born and raised in Nutbush, Tennessee to her initial rise to fame under the leadership of famed blues musician Ike Turner and her abusive relationship with the St. Louis guitarist that ended in 1976 to her 1980s comeback. The book became a worldwide best-seller when it was released and led to the film adaptation, What's Love Got to Do with It, in 1993 starring Angela Bassett as Turner.
