Marie Antoinette: The Journey is a sympathetic 2001 biography of archduchess Marie Antoinette, the Queen of France (1774â€“1792) by Antonia Fraser.  It is the basis for the 2006 Sofia Coppola film Marie Antoinette. The book, which was relaunched to coincide with the release of the related film, has had considerable success.  It has been translated into French and Italian, been awarded the Enid McLeod Literary Prize, received critical praise including being described "definitive" by British historian, Amanda Foreman, author of a bestselling biography of Georgiana, duchess of Devonshire. It is considered, by some modern historians, as the most thorough and balanced biography of the queen,  though it naturally builds upon earlier biographies, first hand accounts, and even the infamous libelles which destroyed the queen's reputation.
