Sonny, after seeing the Russian satellite <a href=\"/wiki/Sputnik\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sputnik\">Sputnik</a>, decides to join the American team of rocket engineers called the Missile Agency when he graduates from school. (Note: In the book <i>Rocket Boys</i>, the main character is always called Sonny. In the movie <i>October Sky</i>, he is called Homer.) Sonny's older brother, Jim Hickam, excels at football and expects to get a college football scholarship. Sonny, however, is terrible at sports and has no special skill that would get him \"out of Coalwood\". Sonny's mother is afraid that he will have to work in the mines after high school.\t\nSonny's first attempt at rocketry (which occurred when he was 14) consists of a flashlight tube and model airplane body as a casing.  It is fueled by flash powder from old cherry bombs. It explodes violently, destroying his mother's fence. After that, Sonny enlists the help of <a href=\"/wiki/Quentin_Wilson_(engineer)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Quentin Wilson (engineer)\">Quentin Wilson</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Roy_Lee_Cooke\" title=\"Roy Lee Cooke\">Roy Lee Cooke</a>, Sherman Siers, Jimmy \"O'Dell\" Carroll, and Billy Rose to help build rockets while forming the BCMA (<a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Big_Creek_Missile_Agency&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Big Creek Missile Agency (page does not exist)\">Big Creek Missile Agency</a>).

He is 8 years old at the beginning of the story but is in high school for most of the book, and he serves as the leader of the Rocket Boys. He is nearsighted and wears glasses, and he plays in the school band.</li>\n<li><b>Elsie Hickam</b> is Homer Hickam's wife and the mother of Jim and \"Sonny\" Hickam. She has a tense relationship with her husband through most of the story. She is supportive of Sonny's rocket building, and often finds herself at odds with her husband, Homer Sr., about the rocket building. She often tells Sonny, \"Don't blow yourself up.\" She works on a mural of <a href=\"/wiki/Myrtle_Beach\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Myrtle Beach\">Myrtle Beach</a> throughout the memoir.</li>\n<li><b>Homer Hickam Sr.</b> is Elsie Hickam's husband and the father of Jim and \"Sonny\" Hickam. He is the hard-headed mine foreman in Coalwood. He takes his job very seriously, going out of his way to help miners in distress. He is almost always at odds with the union leader, John Dubonnet, who dated Elsie when they were all in high school together. Homer Sr. seems to not care about Sonny's affairs as much as he does Jim's; Sonny points this out in the book much to Homer Sr.'s chagrin. He has a spot on his lung that is the common miner's disease, black lung (<a href=\"/wiki/Coal_Workers%27_Pneumoconiosis\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Coal Workers&#39; Pneumoconiosis\">Coal Workers' Pneumoconiosis</a>), but refuses to quit work, although most men who are discovered to have this illness are forced into retirement, but allowed to stay in Coalwood.</li>\n<li><b>Jim Hickam</b> is Homer Hickam Jr.'s older brother and the son of Elsie and Homer Hickam. He is a star athlete, which leads to him having several conflicts with \"Sonny\" over how Homer seems to favor Jim over \"Sonny\". He dates the girl Sonny is in love with, Dorothy Plunk, but later dumps her like he does with many of his girlfriends.</li>\n<li><b><a href=\"/wiki/Quentin_Wilson_(engineer)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Quentin Wilson (engineer)\">Quentin Wilson</a></b> is one of the more intelligent members of the Rocket Boys, the one who does the most math. Quentin carries a suitcase stuffed with books wherever he goes and finds excuses to get out of gym class. He is excitable and often confounds the other members and townspeople with his advanced vocabulary.</li>\n<li><b>Jimmy \"O'Dell\" Carroll</b> is small and excitable, the most emotional member of the group. His father drives the town garbage truck, allowing O'Dell access to many useful items, frequently scrounged to further the group's efforts. He is always scheming of ways of making money, from the failed iron scrap attempt\u2014which took an entire summer, yielded a net loss of one dollar, not counting the destruction of borrowed equipment and almost killing Sonny\u2014to the profitable harvesting of <a href=\"/wiki/Ginseng\" title=\"Ginseng\">ginseng</a>.</li>\n<li><b>Sherman Siers</b> has a weakened left leg as a result of polio, but does not let it slow him down. He is also the most observant and practical member of the team. At the age of twenty-six, Sherman died unexpectedly of a heart attack.</li>\n<li><b><a href=\"/wiki/Roy_Lee_Cooke\" title=\"Roy Lee Cooke\">Roy Lee Cooke</a></b> is Sonny's best friend. He teaches Sonny something about girls. In the follow-up memoir titled <i>The Coalwood Way</i>, it is revealed that he is known as The Big Creek Lovemaster. Roy Lee also knows the moonshiner in town, John Eye, who provides the boys with the alcohol needed for their special propellant they call Zincoshine. On page 302, Roy Lee states that if they were successful in flying the rocket, \"She wouldn't be able to get out of her panties fast enough,\" (referring to a cheerleader)</li>\n<li><b>Willie \"Billy\" Rose</b> is a member of the Rocket Boys who joins the group about a year after it is founded. He has excellent eyesight and can find rockets very well. He is the best runner in the group.</li>\n<li><b><a href=\"/wiki/Freida_J._Riley\" title=\"Freida J. Riley\">Miss Riley</a></b> is a chemistry and physics teacher at Big Creek High School who inspires the Rocket Boys to compete in the National Science Fair. She gives Sonny a book called <i><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Principles_of_Guided_Missile_Design&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Principles of Guided Missile Design (page does not exist)\">Principles of Guided Missile Design</a></i> that is extremely useful to the Rocket Boys in the future. She also orchestrates the Rocket Boys' entry into the National Science Fair. She is diagnosed with <a href=\"/wiki/Hodgkin%27s_Lymphoma\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hodgkin&#39;s Lymphoma\">Hodgkin's Lymphoma</a> shortly before Sonny leaves for the science fair. At first her affliction goes into remission, but later she dies of her disease.</li>\n<li><b>Jake Mosby</b> is a womanizing alcoholic who helps the BCMA in paying off debts. Jake is a mining engineer. He also introduces them to a writer of a small newspaper, Basil Oglethorpe. He later settles down a bit and starts dating Miss Riley for a period of time, trying to be dependable for her. He is a veteran of the <a href=\"/wiki/Korean_War\" title=\"Korean War\">Korean War</a>, and compares the BCMA's rocket launches to his war experiences.</li>\n<li><b>Basil Oglethorpe</b> is the writer of a small newspaper called the <i><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=McDowell_County_Banner&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"McDowell County Banner (page does not exist)\">McDowell County Banner</a></i>. He is in charge of the BCMA's publicity.</li>\n<li><b>Mr. Ferro</b> is in charge of a group of company machinists who help the BCMA build their rockets.</li>\n<li><b>Mr. Caton</b> is a machinist in Mr. Ferro's team. He is the main builder of the BCMA's rockets.</li>\n<li><b>Dorothy Plunk</b> is Sonny's dream girl; he even describes her as \"God's Perfection\" at one point in the memoir. While Sonny spends most of his time infatuated with her, although she still spends time with him, Dorothy only wants a friend relationship and goes out with other boys. For a large section of the book, Sonny ignores her, because she started a relationship with his brother Jim. She was also the valedictorian of Sonny's graduating high school class and got the spot Sonny wanted in a calculus class because her grades were higher.</li>\n<li><b>Valentine Carmina</b> is an older girl who likes Sonny. Ultimately, it is implied she has sex with him in the backseat of a car on the same night Dorothy breaks his heart.  Homer later describes the event as her pity to him.</li>\n<li><b>Mr. Isaac Bykovski</b> is a worker in the mine who helps Sonny with his first rockets. Homer Sr. makes him work in the mine as punishment for helping Sonny. Later, Homer Sr. offers him his job back in the machine shop, but Bykovski does not accept the offer because he made more money in the mine. He is later killed in a mine collapse while operating a loader.</li>\n<li><b>Geneva Eggers</b> is a middle-aged woman who was rescued as a baby by Homer Hickam Sr. when her house was on fire. The rest of her family was still in the house when it went up in flames but she was the only one whom Homer Sr. saw. Everyone else in her family perished. It is implied that after the fire, she turned to prostitution in order to support herself. During the novel, she invites Sonny into her home when he almost freezes to death on a December night and gives him a new set of clothes. Sonny feels uncomfortable changing in front of her and, sensing the hesitation, she replies, \"Oh, come on. You ain't gonna show me nothin' I ain't already seen too many times.\"</li>\n<li><b>Buchanan \"Buck\" Trant </b> is a football player who hates Sonny. He insults Sonny and even starts to tear down \"<a href=\"/wiki/Cape_Coalwood\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cape Coalwood\">Cape Coalwood</a>.\"</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=October_Sky_(novel)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Homer_Hickam\" title=\"Homer Hickam\">Homer Hickam</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/October_Sky\" title=\"October Sky\">October Sky</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=October_Sky_(novel)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><cite class=\"citation web\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.berea.edu/appalachiancenter/weatherford/pastwinners.asp\">\"Weatherford Award\"</a><span class=\"reference-accessdate\">.
