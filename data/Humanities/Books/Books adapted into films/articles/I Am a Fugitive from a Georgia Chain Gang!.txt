I Am a Fugitive from a Georgia Chain Gang! is a book written by Robert Elliott Burns in 1932 and published by Grosset & Dunlap.  The book tells the story of Burns' imprisonment on a chain gang in Georgia in the 1920s, his subsequent escape, and the furor that developed. The story was first published in January 1932, serialized  in True Detective Mysteries magazine.  Later that year, Burns' story was made into the motion picture I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang, starring Paul Muni. The book and movie were both credited with helping to reform deplorable conditions on Deep South chain gangs under Governor Ellis Arnall in 1943.  A sequel, Out of These Chains, was written by Burns' brother, Vincent Godfrey Burns, an Episcopalian priest, in 1942.
