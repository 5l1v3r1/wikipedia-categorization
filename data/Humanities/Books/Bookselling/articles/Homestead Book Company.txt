Tatelman initially delivered comix to various accounts between Olympia and Bellingham in Washington.  The company soon began distributing books with their first book being The Complete Guide to Growing Marijuana by David Fleming. Homestead Book Company was also one of the first distributors for High Times Magazine.  During the Teononacatl Mushroom Conference in 1977, Tatelman met with author Bob Harris and they decided to start offering home grown Psilocybe mushroom kits. The kits were introduced with growing methods that were outlined in Harris' book Growing Wild Mushrooms.  The first kits were introduced in 1978 and sold through advertisements in High Times Magazine. The kits are still on the market and are now referred to by the name EZ-Gro Mushroom Kits.   Homestead Book Company also published many books over the years, including several associated with the growing and cultivating of Psilocybe Mushrooms.
