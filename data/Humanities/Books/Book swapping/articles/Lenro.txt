Lenro is a book sharing website that connects book readers locally so that they can borrow, lend or exchange books with each other.  Members need to create a free account to borrow, lend or exchange books.    Lenro users can search for a book to check its availability (to borrow) or can see all the books that are available near them. The website tells you the distance to the other book readers near you. Borrower sends a borrow request to the lender which lender can either accept or reject. Members can communicate on Lenro chat and finalize a date, time, and venue to meet for the book exchange. The in-person meeting opens the door to book discussions as well.  Members' profile page shows the social profiles (Facebook/Linkedin/etc) of the member so that other users can have a look at those profiles to gain some level of trust before meeting for the first time. Members can also rate and review the books. The website has gamification points called Karma points. Members get points for activities like adding a book to lend, adding a book review, and borrowing/lending a book.  Book swapping
