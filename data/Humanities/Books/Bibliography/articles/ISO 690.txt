ISO 690 is an ISO standard for bibliographic referencing in different kind of documents.   It includes electronic documents, and specifies the elements to be included in references to published documents, and the order in which the elements of the reference should be stated. Punctuation and style (output mask) are not part of the standard; it is a standard for content more than for presentation. Thus, it influences a user's XML and XSL, although not necessarily the CSS. ISO 690 covers references to published material in both print and non-print form.  The latest version was published in 2010 and covers all kinds of information resources, including monographs, serials, contributions, patents, cartographic materials, electronic information resources (including computer software and databases), music, recorded sound, prints, photographs, graphic and audiovisual works, and moving images.  Even though ISO 690:2010(E) generally suggests to place the date of publication after place and publisher (referred to as "production information" ) it also hints to the Harvard system style (name-date system) and provides also various examples of its way of citation in the annex of ISO 690:2010(E).  Until 2010, ISO 690 appeared in two ISO documents: Actual status of standard is ISO 690:2010.  The material is copyrighted and not free for distribution. Basically, the application of older version of ISO standard is not a fault.
