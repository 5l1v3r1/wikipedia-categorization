The Triennial E. A. Lowe Lectures are an ongoing series of lectures held at Corpus Christi College, University of Oxford, in memory of the noted palaeographer E. A. Lowe who was an Honorary Fellow of the College from 1954 until his death in 1969. They are delivered by prominent palaeographers, with each scholar giving a trio of lectures on a topic within the field.  Oxford University Press sometimes publishes revised versions of the lectures. Lecturers have included N. G. Wilson, A. C. de la Mare, Anthony Grafton, and Michael Lapidge.
