This is a list of bookstore chains with brick-and-mortar locations. In the United Kingdom and many parts of the English speaking world, they are known as "Bookshops" and "newsagents". In American English, they are called "bookstores", or sometimes "newsstands", as they also usually carry newspapers and magazines.  This list includes both current and defunct businesses, and also includes large independent bookstores that have multiple locations, but that use a different business model than most business chains.
