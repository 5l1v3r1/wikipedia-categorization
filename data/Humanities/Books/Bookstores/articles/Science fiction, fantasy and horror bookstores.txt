Beginning in the 1970s, with the popularity of J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings series, a variety of independent bookstores specializing in science fiction, fantasy, horror, and related genres (often mystery, comics, games, and/or collectibles), began opening.  Among the first were Bakka-Phoenix Bookstore in Toronto and A Change of Hobbit in Southern California, both established in 1972.  As independent bookstores suffered during the business shifts of the late 20th and early 21st century, many of these closed.  During their heyday, however, they were a key part of science fiction fandom, facilitating not just publishing, distribution, and promotion of books, but public events, social events, and community-building. This list is meant to include past and present "brick-and-mortar" bookstores.  Bookstores that were once "brick-and-mortar", but have moved online, should be included.  Bookstores that have only ever been solely online vendors should be listed separately.
