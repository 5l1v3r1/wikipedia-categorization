Perseus Books Group was an American publishing company founded in 1996 by investor Frank Pearl.  It was named Publisher of the Year in 2007 by Publishers Weekly magazine for its role in taking on publishers formerly distributed by Publishers Group West and acquiring Avalon Publishing Group.  After the death of Frank Pearl, Perseus was sold to Centre Lane Partners in 2015, a private equity firm.  In April 2016, its name and publishing business was acquired by Hachette Book Group and its distribution business by Ingram Content Group.  In January 2007, Perseus Book Group purchased Avalon Publishing Group, the parent company of Carroll & Graf and Thunder's Mouth Press;  the purchaser folded both imprints and stopped publishing books under those names in May 2007.  The Perseus Books Group currently has the following imprints:  Before Avalon Publishing Group was integrated into the Perseus Books Group, it published on 14 imprint presses.  In 2007, some of these imprints were integrated into the Perseus Books Group, while others folded or were sold to other companies. Perseus also sold one of their imprints in the restructuring process. Perseus previously owned separate book distribution companies.
