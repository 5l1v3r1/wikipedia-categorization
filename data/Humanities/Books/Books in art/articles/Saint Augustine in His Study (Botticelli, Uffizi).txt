Saint Augustine in His Study, is a painting by the Italian Renaissance master Sandro Botticelli, finished around 1490â€“1494. It is housed in the Uffizi, in Florence. This work was probably executed for an Augustinian hermit of Santo Spirito, as shown by the fact the saint wears both episcopal and hermit garments. As many of Botticelli's late works, it is inspired by the preaching of Savonarola.
