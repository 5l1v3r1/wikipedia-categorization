Controversy concerning the true nature of Henry's presence in the panels - if any - along with the inclusion of figures that can be identified as his brothers, all of whom died before 1450, renders it difficult to assign any secure date for the creation of the panels other than sometime during the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Floruit\" title=\"Floruit\">floruit</a></i> of the painter Gon\u00e7alves.\n</p><p>The original retable, during its stay in the Cathedral of Lisbon, contained \"over twelve\" panels, as a source from 1767 states.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> They were displayed in the cathedral at least until 1690 and were set aside in the cathedral until 1742.

However, there are strong reasons to doubt that this is him.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Marques_3-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Marques-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tleft\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:152px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Henry_the_Navigator_(Cronicas).jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Henry_the_Navigator_%28Cronicas%29.jpg/150px-Henry_the_Navigator_%28Cronicas%29.jpg\" width=\"150\" height=\"210\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Henry_the_Navigator_%28Cronicas%29.jpg/225px-Henry_the_Navigator_%28Cronicas%29.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Henry_the_Navigator_%28Cronicas%29.jpg/300px-Henry_the_Navigator_%28Cronicas%29.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"650\" data-file-height=\"909\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Henry_the_Navigator_(Cronicas).jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Frontispiece in Zurara's <i>Cr\u00f3nicas dos Feitos de Guin\u00e9</i> (Paris codex)</div></div></div>\n<p>The most basic problem in identifying the man-in-the-chaperon in the Saint Vincent Panels derives from the lack of confirmed portraits of Prince Henry that date from his lifetime. The only other 15th-century image of the man-in-the-chaperon is found in the frontispiece of a copy (currently held by the <a href=\"/wiki/Biblioth%C3%A8que_nationale_de_France\" title=\"Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France\">Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France</a>) of <a href=\"/wiki/Gomes_Eanes_de_Zurara\" title=\"Gomes Eanes de Zurara\">Gomes Eanes de Zurara</a>'s <i>Cr\u00f3nicas dos Feitos de Guin\u00e9</i>, written in 1453.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Marques_3-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Marques-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> Zurara's book is an account of the early <a href=\"/wiki/Portuguese_discoveries\" title=\"Portuguese discoveries\">Portuguese discoveries</a> in Africa along with a <a href=\"/wiki/Hagiography\" title=\"Hagiography\">hagiography</a> of Prince Henry, to whom the author assigned singular credit for the discoveries. As a result, it has been assumed that the frontispiece depicts Henry, especially since the motto underneath it seems to have been Henry's own.\n</p><p>One alternative hypothesis postulates that the man-in-the-chaperon in Zurara's book might actually be King <a href=\"/wiki/Edward_of_Portugal\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Edward of Portugal\">Edward of Portugal</a> (r. 1431-38), Prince Henry's brother.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Marques_3-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Marques-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> It has been pointed out that critical phases of the discoveries were launched during his reign, and it would not be unusual for a portrait of a king to adorn a chronicle of events that occurred during his reign.\n</p><p>This alternative hypothesis can be used to help clarify the identity of the figures  surrounding St. Vincent in the Panel of the Prince. Specifically, it offers an explanation for the symmetrical arrangement of men and women as pairings of kings and queens. In this interpretation, the standing pair would be King Edward (in a black chaperon), standing at the right and balanced on the left by his wife, Queen <a href=\"/wiki/Eleanor_of_Aragon,_Queen_of_Portugal\" title=\"Eleanor of Aragon, Queen of Portugal\">Eleanor of Aragon</a>. Below them would be their son, King <a href=\"/wiki/Afonso_V_of_Portugal\" title=\"Afonso V of Portugal\">Afonso V of Portugal</a>, kneeling on the right and facing his consort, Queen <a href=\"/wiki/Isabella_of_Coimbra\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Isabella of Coimbra\">Isabella of Coimbra</a>, who is kneeling on the left. The boy in the panel would then be Edward's heir, the future King <a href=\"/wiki/John_II_of_Portugal\" title=\"John II of Portugal\">John II of Portugal</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Marques_3-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Marques-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>This alternative hypothesis seems more logical than the original hypothesis that insists on identifying the man-in-the-chaperon as Prince Henry. Since Henry was a bachelor, it is not obvious what woman would be suitable to pair with him as the standing figure on the left. His closest female relatives were his mother <a href=\"/wiki/Philippa_of_Lancaster\" title=\"Philippa of Lancaster\">Philippa</a> and sister, <a href=\"/wiki/Isabella_of_Portugal_(1397%E2%80%931471)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Isabella of Portugal (1397\u20131471)\">Isabella</a>, Duchess of Burgundy, both of whom would be more properly paired with their husbands. Moreover, Isabella did not live in Portugal after 1430, thus her lack of involvement with Portuguese society at the time the panel was painted would probably disqualify her from inclusion. If the uncle of a king were to be incorporated in the panel, it would more properly be <a href=\"/wiki/Peter,_Duke_of_Coimbra\" title=\"Peter, Duke of Coimbra\">Peter, Duke of Coimbra</a>, who was once the regent of Afonso V and the father of his bride.\n</p><p>Another interpretation of the figures includes Henry in the panel, but proposes Edward as the kneeling king and Afonso V as the boy. Regardless, all traditional means of explaining Henry's presence in the panel strike one as forced, formulated simply to accommodate a preconceived notion that Henry must be the man-in-the-chaperon. Since Edward was the brother of Henry, it is perfectly possible that he bore a close enough resemblance to Henry that the traditional identification in the Zurara book is perfectly correct, and that Edward's appearance in the panel is only coincidentally similar to what is depicted for Henry in the Zurara book.\n</p><p>The alternative hypothesis with King Edward as the man-in-the-chaperon is more logical; pairs of kings and queens are all that are featured in the panel, with no intrusion from other family members, except for the minor son of one of the royal pairs.  Other relatives are featured in a panel of their own (see below). In consideration of this, the Panel of the Prince perhaps ought to be called the Panel of Kings instead, with the king intended to be featured most prominently apparently Afonso V, who was the reigning king of Portugal throughout the <i>floruit</i> of Nuno Gon\u00e7alves, thus the most likely candidate as patron for the preparation of the panels.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Panel_of_the_Knights:_alternative_hypothesis\">Panel of the Knights: alternative hypothesis</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Saint_Vincent_Panels&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Panel of the Knights: alternative hypothesis\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:152px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Nu%C3%B1o_Gon%C3%A7alves_001.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Nu%C3%B1o_Gon%C3%A7alves_001.jpg/150px-Nu%C3%B1o_Gon%C3%A7alves_001.jpg\" width=\"150\" height=\"525\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Nu%C3%B1o_Gon%C3%A7alves_001.jpg/225px-Nu%C3%B1o_Gon%C3%A7alves_001.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Nu%C3%B1o_Gon%C3%A7alves_001.jpg/300px-Nu%C3%B1o_Gon%C3%A7alves_001.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"776\" data-file-height=\"2714\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Nu%C3%B1o_Gon%C3%A7alves_001.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>The fifth panel - Panel of the Knights</div></div></div>\n<p>Hypotheses that assert Henry the Navigator is not the man-in-the-chaperon identify him in another panel: the fifth panel known as the \"Panel of the Knights\".
