Femme Lisant is a 1869 painting by French artist Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot. The painting is now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.  The painting depicts a woman reading; in the distance is a man in a boat. Corot, whose reputation was made as a landscape painter, painted many images of solitary, pensive women in his later years. Femme Lisant, which was shown at the Salon of 1869, is the only one of them that he exhibited in his lifetime.
