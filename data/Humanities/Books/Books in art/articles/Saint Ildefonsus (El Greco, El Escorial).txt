Saint Ildefonsus is a 1609 painting by El Greco. It and his Saint Peter were both painted for the Iglesia de San Vicente, Toledo. It has also previously been misidentified as Pope Eugene I or saint Blaise. It is now in the Real Monasterio de San Lorenzo de El Escorial. Ildefonsus is shown in a chasuble, pallium and mitre, holding a bishop's staff and an open book. The full robes emphasise the model's anatomy, showing Michelangelo's influence on El Greco.
