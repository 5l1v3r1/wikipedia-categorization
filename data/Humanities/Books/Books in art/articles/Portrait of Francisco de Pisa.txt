Portrait of Francisco de Pisa is a 1614 painting by El Greco, now in the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, Texas. Most art historians identify it as doctor Francisco de Pisa, a Spanish cleric, though a minority identify it as the Italian historian Giacomo Bosio due to the words shown in the open book. Francisco de Pisa was an enemy of Teresa of √Åvila, who he criticised because he felt that her works contained "much that contradicts truth and sound doctrine and all good use of mental prayer". The pose of the subject is similar to that in Portrait of Cardinal Tavera, which is of a similar date.
