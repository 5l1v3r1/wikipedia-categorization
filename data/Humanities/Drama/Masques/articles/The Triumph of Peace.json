In <a href=\"/wiki/1632_in_literature\" title=\"1632 in literature\">1632</a> the Puritan controversialist <a href=\"/wiki/William_Prynne\" title=\"William Prynne\">William Prynne</a> (himself an Inns of Court man) had dedicated his anti-theatre diatribe <i><a href=\"/wiki/Histriomastix\" title=\"Histriomastix\">Histriomastix</a></i> to the Inns; since <i>Histriomastix</i> was perceived as insulting to Queen <a href=\"/wiki/Henrietta_Maria_of_France\" title=\"Henrietta Maria of France\">Henrietta Maria</a>, the masque was the Inns' signal of their total rejection of any connection with Prynne's book or his views.\n</p><p>Shirley was chosen to write the masque because he was a member of <a href=\"/wiki/Gray%27s_Inn\" title=\"Gray&#39;s Inn\">Gray's Inn</a>. He was not a law student or a lawyer; rather, he was a gentleman boarder, an arrangement preferred by some literary figures of the time. (<a href=\"/wiki/John_Ford_(dramatist)\" title=\"John Ford (dramatist)\">John Ford</a> was another gentleman boarder). Shirley produced an acceptable text &#8212; though he was bold enough to offer some tactfully-phrased advice to his king.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Publication\">Publication</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=The_Triumph_of_Peace&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Publication\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The masque was entered into the <a href=\"/wiki/Stationers%27_Register\" title=\"Stationers&#39; Register\">Stationers' Register</a> on 24 January 1634 and was licensed for performance by Sir <a href=\"/wiki/Henry_Herbert_(Master_of_the_Revels)\" title=\"Henry Herbert (Master of the Revels)\">Henry Herbert</a>, the <a href=\"/wiki/Master_of_the_Revels\" title=\"Master of the Revels\">Master of the Revels</a>, on the date it was acted, 3 February 1634.

Documents pertaining to the masque were preserved among Whitelocke's unpublished papers. As a result, more is known about the production of <i>The Triumph of Peace</i> than perhaps any other masque of the <a href=\"/wiki/Tudor_dynasty\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Tudor dynasty\">Tudor</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/House_of_Stuart\" title=\"House of Stuart\">Stuart</a> eras &#8212; including \"a cast list, the names and voice parts of all the singers, the names and instruments of all the musicians, diagrams with musicians' names for soloists and chorus positions during the mask, a cue sheet for the serious part of the mask, names of musicians who played at the <a href=\"/wiki/Blackfriars_Theatre\" title=\"Blackfriars Theatre\">Blackfriars</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Cockpit_Theatre\" title=\"Cockpit Theatre\">Cockpit</a>,\" and other data.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>(Murray Lefkowitz, the musicologist who discovered the masque papers at <a href=\"/wiki/Longleat\" title=\"Longleat\">Longleat</a>, has written extensively on the subject.

The masquers started out at <a href=\"/wiki/Ely_Place\" title=\"Ely Place\">Ely House</a>, then the London residence of the <a href=\"/wiki/Bishops_of_Ely\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Bishops of Ely\">Bishops of Ely</a>, and moved in procession or \"cavalcade\" down Chancery Lane and <a href=\"/wiki/Strand,_London\" title=\"Strand, London\">the Strand</a> to Whitehall. This parade was led by the King's Marshall and his men bearing torches, who were followed by 100 members of the Inns of Court, 25 from each of the four Inns, dressed in gold and silver lace. Then came two music chariots; the first held eight lutenists dressed as priests and <a href=\"/wiki/Sibyl\" title=\"Sibyl\">Sybils</a>, while the second carried singers \"who struck picturesque poses in costumes representing the celestial bodies in harmonious motion.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> Then came the actors of the masque; the boys in one anti-masque were costumed as birds. The principal masquers came last, in four chariots, each drawn by four horses; the horses were decked in silver and crimson cloths and white and red feathers, and each chariot bore two \"flaming huge flambeaux\" on its sides. (Each of the Inns of Court furnished twenty dozen torches and 15 flambeaux for the procession.) Charles and Henrietta Maria, watching this from Whitehall, were so impressed that they had the parade turn around and pass them again.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The theme of the masque was relatively simple and straightforward: the spirits of Peace, Law, and Justice descend to honor the English monarchs. Yet the expression is complex, with seven changes of scene; at one point the moon sets in an open landscape and \"Amphiluche,\" the harbinger of morning, rises in turn. There are no fewer than eight anti-masques.\n</p><p>The masque featured the personifications standard to the form, including Opinion, Confidence, Fancy, Jollity, Novelty, and others; also, generic tradesmen, a Tailor, Carpenter, Painter, Feathermaker's Wife, Embroiderer's Wife, etc. The costumes were rich and fantastic: \"Fancy in a suit of several-colored feathers, hooded, a pair of bat's wings on his shoulders...Jollity in a flame-colored suit, but tricked like a <a href=\"/wiki/Morris_dance\" title=\"Morris dance\">morris dancer</a>, with scarfs and napkins, his hat fashioned like a cone....\" Some of the costumes were \"wrought as thick with silver spangles as they could be placed.\" At one point in the masque, a windmill, a knight and his squire entered &#8212; an obvious allusion to <i><a href=\"/wiki/Don_Quixote\" title=\"Don Quixote\">Don Quixote</a></i> &#8212; and engaged in a mock combat. Shirley deliberately included elements in the masque, including \"two wanton gamesters,\" that were precisely the type of elements criticized by Prynne in <i>Histriomastix</i>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Queen Henrietta liked the masque so much that she arranged for a repeat performance at <a href=\"/wiki/Merchant_Taylors%27_Hall,_London\" title=\"Merchant Taylors&#39; Hall, London\">Merchant Taylors' Hall</a> on 13 February. The cost for the show was extraordinary: \u00a31000 for the music; a hundred costumes at \u00a3100 each. The total cost of the extravaganza was, according to Whitelocke, \u00a321,000, all paid by the Inns of Court (at a time when a squire might earn \u00a3100 in a year).<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> By some accounts (including that of Shirley himself), <i>The Triumph of Peace</i> was the most spectacular masque of the period.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Notes\">Notes</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=The_Triumph_of_Peace&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Notes\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><i>The Library,</i> 5, series 1 (1946), pp. 113-26.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-2\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">John R.
