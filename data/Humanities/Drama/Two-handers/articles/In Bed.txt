En la cama (English: In Bed) is a 2005 Chilean film directed by Mat√≠as Bize and starring Blanca Lewin and Gonzalo Valenzuela. It was Chile's submission to the 79th Academy Awards for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, but was not accepted as a nominee.   Nevertheless, the film garnered ten awards at various film festivals. Set entirely in a Santiago motel room, two young middle-class people are seen making love. They met while leaving a party and do not know each other's names. The man and woman eventually tell each other their names; he is Bruno and she is Daniela. As the night progresses in between having sex with each other, they share more details of their lives, their sorrows and their fears. Bruno pretends that his girlfriend, who rings him up on his cellphone, is his ex and admits that he is moving to Belgium for postgraduate study. Daniela admits that her man can be violent but she is going to marry him anyway. From initial passion they have moved to confidences, even tenderness, yet she insists that it will remain her last fling before matrimony.
