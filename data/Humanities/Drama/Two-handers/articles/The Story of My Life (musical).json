Amazon.com describes the musical as \"an authentic and affecting work, told through a series of songs in turn playful, touching and dramatic, and expertly orchestrated by <a href=\"/wiki/Jonathan_Tunick\" title=\"Jonathan Tunick\">Jonathan Tunick</a>. One New York critic predicted, 'When the original cast recording comes out, see if you don't find yourself moved to Google the name of some long-lost friend with whom you simply lost touch. <i>The Story Of My Life</i> inspires us to reconnect with those who were part of the earliest chapters of our own life stories'.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p><b>Summary</b>\n</p><p>Thomas stands alone, contemplating how to write his eulogy for his best friend Alvin's funeral. He comes to the conclusion that it should be about his life with Alvin (\"Write What You Know\") but cannot bring himself to write anything down. He is then visited by the ghost of Alvin, who tells him that they will write story after story about their childhood, until Thomas has completed the eulogy. Alvin walks around the room and removes stories from the room\u2019s bookshelves, which make up the musical\u2019s remaining songs.\n</p><p>Starting at the beginning of their friendship, Alvin recalls their meeting in \"Mrs. Remington('s)\" first-grade class where Alvin was the only student to recognize that Thomas was dressed as Clarence (from <i><a href=\"/wiki/It%27s_a_Wonderful_Life\" title=\"It&#39;s a Wonderful Life\">It's a Wonderful Life</a></i>) for Halloween. The two became inseparable, with Thomas spending more and more time with Alvin in his father\u2019s bookstore. Alvin gives Thomas \u201cThe Greatest Gift\u201d of a copy of <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Tom_Sawyer\" title=\"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\">The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</a></i>, which inspires Thomas\u2019 sixth-grade book report (\u201c1876\u201d). This book report inspired Thomas to be a writer and, outside the story, Thomas tries to pull the focus back to writing Alvin\u2019s eulogy.\n</p><p>Alvin removes a story from the shelf, which is about his abnormal tendencies and Thomas\u2019 attempts to reign them in (\u201cNormal\u201d). The story ends with a group of bullies throwing Alvin\u2019s bathrobe, which belonged to his deceased mother, over a bridge. Alvin is sad but hopeful that \u201cPeople Carry On\u201d after a loss. In another story, Thomas reads his college entrance essay on the <a href=\"/wiki/Butterfly_effect\" title=\"Butterfly effect\">Butterfly Effect</a> (\u201cThe Butterfly\u201d) to Alvin. Thomas is accepted into college and leaves Alvin, who is now working at his father\u2019s bookstore, behind (\u201cSaying Goodbye, Part 1\u201d). When Thomas comes home for Christmas, he talks about his creative process; this bores Alvin, who wants to play in the snow as they did when they were young (\u201cHere\u2019s Where It Begins\u201d). \n</p><p>Thomas leaves, graduates, and becomes a semi-famous writer. When he returns home again, he brings home his \u201ccolleague, girlfriend, and number-one fan\u201d Anne. Alvin worries that Anne will draw Thomas away from him and seems sad about his life in the bookstore, which he assumes ownership of after his father gets sick (\u201cSaying Goodbye, Part 2\u201d). Thomas returns home to help Alvin with the paperwork to finish the transfer of ownership. Alvin asks Thomas to stay in town with him, but Thomas invites Alvin to join him in the city instead (\u201cIndependence Day\u201d). After receiving many excited phone calls from Alvin, Thomas tells him that he shouldn\u2019t come after all because it\u2019s \u201cnot a good time,\u201d and then breaks up with Anne (\u201cI Like It Here\u201d).\n</p><p>Thomas doesn\u2019t tell Alvin about the break-up, and tries to \u201cstreamline his personal life\u201d to avoid writer\u2019s block. Alvin writes Thomas from the bookstore to congratulate him on his continued success (\u201cYou\u2019re Amazing, Tom\u201d). Thomas ignores the letters and stops coming home, suffering from writer\u2019s block while writing about the angles in the snow (\u201cNothing There\u201d).\n</p><p>Thomas goes home yet again and sneaks in to watch Alvin deliver the eulogy at his father\u2019s funeral, which is made up of \u201cstory after story after story.\u201d Thomas is mad that Alvin is at ease telling the stories and, in retrospect, recognizes that he didn\u2019t see the struggles Alvin faced at the time (\u201cI Didn\u2019t See Alvin\u201d). Thomas notes that this was the last time he saw Alvin alive.\n</p><p>After finishing the story of his father\u2019s eulogy, Alvin attempts one last time to bring Thomas back to writing the eulogy for his own funeral (\u201cThis Is It\u201d). Thomas finally sits and finishes his \u201cwork in progress\u201d about their childhood Christmas traditions (\u201cAngels in the Snow\u201d), and finally delivers his eulogy\u2014a collection of stories\u2014for Alvin.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Productions\">Productions</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=The_Story_of_My_Life_(musical)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Productions\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Following developmental readings at <a href=\"/wiki/Manhattan_Theatre_Club\" title=\"Manhattan Theatre Club\">Manhattan Theatre Club</a>, The <a href=\"/wiki/Eugene_O%27Neill_Theater_Center\" title=\"Eugene O&#39;Neill Theater Center\">Eugene O'Neill Theater Center</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Canadian_Stage_Company\" title=\"Canadian Stage Company\">Canadian Stage Company</a>, <i>The Story of My Life</i> was produced in Toronto at the <a href=\"/wiki/Canadian_Stage_Company\" title=\"Canadian Stage Company\">Canadian Stage Company</a> in 2006.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>  It was next produced at the National Alliance for Musical Theatre's Festival of New Musicals in the fall of 2007.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The musical then ran at <a href=\"/wiki/Goodspeed_Musicals\" title=\"Goodspeed Musicals\">Goodspeed Musicals</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/East_Haddam,_Connecticut\" title=\"East Haddam, Connecticut\">East Haddam, Connecticut</a> from October 10, 2008 through November 2.

Bartram's lovely songs resonate on many levels, while Richard Maltby Jr. adds further dimension with his sharply-etched direction. Will Chase as Thomas and Malcolm Gets as Alvin are exceptionally talented. So perfectly matched in ways both subtle and large, they deliver splendidly calibrated performances that are simply flawless....This is an impressive collaborative effort that, despite its minimalism,
