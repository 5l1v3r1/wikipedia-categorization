The Firehall Arts Centre (also called the Firehall Centre for the Arts) is an arts centre in the Downtown Eastside of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.  The building also falls within the borders of Gastown.  Firehall is a small building,  originally built as a fire station in 1906.  Three theatre companies are based out of Firehall: Touchstone Theatre, Firehall Theatre Company, and Axis Mime.  Firehall is devoted to exhibiting dance, performance art, and new plays.  Firehall is Vancouver's foremost exhibitor of experimental theatre.  The theatre has a 150-seat capacity.  St. James Anglican Church is diagonally opposite the intersection from Firehall.  Every year, Firehall hosts a dance festival called "Dancing on the Edge" that lasts two weeks.
