Driving into Walls (2012) is a play written by Suzie Miller and produced by Barking Gecko Theatre Company. Miller and director John Sheedy interviewed over 500 Western Australian teens for the play, asking about their day-to-day lives and drawing from that many of the stories of the play.    The plot of the story focuses on five teenagers and their online and offline relationships.  The story does not follow a linear narrative and is more a collection of short stories with a shared message than one complete story.  Under the direction of John Sheedy, the show was first performed as part of the 2012 Perth International Arts Festival.  It was later performed in the State Theatre Centre of Western Australia in the Underground studio.
