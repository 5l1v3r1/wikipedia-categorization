In the aftermath of the <a href=\"/wiki/October_Revolution\" title=\"October Revolution\">October Revolution</a>, the once iron clad Russian <a href=\"/wiki/Class_system\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Class system\">class system</a> has disintegrated. The plot focuses on the <a href=\"/wiki/Russian_nobility\" title=\"Russian nobility\">aristocratic</a> Mukovnin family and their attempts to adapt to the hardships of <a href=\"/wiki/War_communism\" title=\"War communism\">war communism</a> and chaos. The elderly General Mukovnin is writing books about Russia's <a href=\"/wiki/Military_history\" title=\"Military history\">military history</a>, where he criticizes the harsh treatment of common soldiers under the <a href=\"/wiki/Imperial_Russian_Army\" title=\"Imperial Russian Army\">Imperial Russian Army</a>. He sympathizes with Lenin's Bolsheviks and regards them as \"gatherers of the Russian lands\" akin to <a href=\"/wiki/Ivan_Kalita\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Ivan Kalita\">Ivan Kalita</a>. His daughter, the ditzy and superficial Ludmila, is hoping for an advantageous marriage with Isaac Dimshits, the <a href=\"/wiki/Soviet_Jews\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Soviet Jews\">Jewish</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Mob_boss\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Mob boss\">mob boss</a> who dominates the city's <a href=\"/wiki/Black_market\" title=\"Black market\">black market</a> food supply. Her cousin, Katya Felsen, is unhappy and pessimistic about the new regime, despite having an affair with a senior <a href=\"/wiki/Soviet_Army\" title=\"Soviet Army\">Soviet Army</a> officer. The General's eldest daughter, Maria, is an idealistic Communist and a <a href=\"/wiki/Political_officer_(military)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Political officer (military)\">political officer</a> assigned to the Soviet Army. During the entire play, she is away on the front and is quoted, but never seen.\n</p><p>Ultimately, Dimshits makes sexual advances to Ludmila, who repels them by claiming to have toothache, to his great discontent and humiliation. Ludmila's intentions are to achieve Dimshits' respect and finally marry him. Dimshits, however, is already married, and only wants Ludmila as a <a href=\"/wiki/Mistress_(lover)\" title=\"Mistress (lover)\">mistress</a>. According to Dimshits, \"People like her are unworthy of even tying my wife's shoelaces!\"\n</p><p>At the time of their next rendezvous, the embittered Dimshits does not show up. In the adjacent apartment, Captain Viskovsky, a <a href=\"/wiki/White_Army\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"White Army\">White Army</a> officer turned jewel thief who works for Dimshits and whose advances were rejected by Maria. Viskovsky is drinking together with Yasha Kravchenko, a corrupt artillery officer in the <a href=\"/wiki/Red_Army\" title=\"Red Army\">Red Army</a>. Viskovsky invites Ludmila in, gets her drunk and then rapes her in a nearby room. Disgusted, Kravchenko reproaches him for having infected Ludmila with <a href=\"/wiki/Gonorrhea\" title=\"Gonorrhea\">Gonorrhea</a>. Viskovsky threatens to beat Kravchenko, who pulls his gun and initiates a gun battle in which each kills the other. As a result, the Soviet police, or <a href=\"/wiki/Militsiya\" title=\"Militsiya\">militsiya</a>, arrest Ludmila, the lone survivor. At the station, the interrogator assumes that she is a <a href=\"/wiki/Prostitute\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Prostitute\">prostitute</a> who smuggles thread for Dimshits' gang. While she protests her innocence and begs for a doctor, the interrogator demands to know how many times she has been arrested, and then shouts in anger that he has not slept in five days.\n</p><p>A crippled <a href=\"/wiki/World_War_I\" title=\"World War I\">World War I</a> veteran, who also works for Dimshits, arrives at the Mukovnins' apartment with the news. The General, fearful that she may have been arrested by the <a href=\"/wiki/CHEKA\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"CHEKA\">CHEKA</a>, first intends to demand her release, then realizes that that is impossible and instead wants to take advice with Maria. Therefore, he checks to make sure that his other daughter, Maria, has received his earlier telegram, in which he urged her to return from the front to visit him. He learns that the telegram has been delivered and convinces himself that Maria will be coming very soon. He even declares that he is not worried about Ludmila and that this will be a valuable lesson for her, but then has a massive heart attack seconds later. His condition is critical, but it proves impossible to fetch a doctor at night to help him.\n</p><p>Soon afterwards, a soldier from Maria's division arrives. He announces that Maria has been unable to come because of the continuing military operations. The General enters the room, expecting to see Maria, but is shocked to see only a soldier he does not know and possibly assumes that Maria has been killed. He instantly dies of a massive stroke.\n</p><p>Later, two workers prepare the Mukovnins' former apartment for its new tenants. They are \"bossed around\" by their forewoman, the local street-sweeper, who is in charge of apartments. Katya arrives with Sushkin, a person who describes himself as a \"lover of antiquities\". She announces that she is selling the Mukovnins' antique furniture on Maria's orders. The forewoman of the workers refuses to allow this, saying that the new tenants were promised a fully furnished apartment. An enraged Sushkin threatens her, hinting that he can bring \"people\" (presumably <a href=\"/wiki/Militsiya\" title=\"Militsiya\">militsiya</a> men or CHEKA agents) to arrest her. However, she refuses to yield unless he can show her a warrant. After Sushkin leaves in a huff, the two workers comment on the forewoman's conduct and observe that she wasn't so daring during the old general's time. Yet, they recall the general as a nice person, loved by the common people. Meanwhile, the new tenants, a worker and his pregnant wife, settle into their new home.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Reception\">Reception</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Maria_(play)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Reception\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><i>Maria</i> is rooted in Babel's work as an investigative reporter for <a href=\"/wiki/Maxim_Gorky\" title=\"Maxim Gorky\">Maxim Gorky</a>'s <a href=\"/wiki/Menshevik\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Menshevik\">Menshevik</a> newspaper, <i>Novaya zhizn</i> (\u041d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u044c).

Noting the play's implicit rejection of <a href=\"/wiki/Socialist_realism\" title=\"Socialist realism\">socialist realism</a>, Gorky accused Babel of having a \"<a href=\"/wiki/Charles_Baudelaire\" title=\"Charles Baudelaire\">Baudelairian</a> predilection for rotting meat.\" Gorky further warned his friend that \"political inferences\" would be made \"that will be personally harmful to you.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>\nAccording to Babel's <a href=\"/wiki/Common_law_wife\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Common law wife\">common law wife</a>, Antonina Pirozhkova, </p><blockquote><p>\"Once Babel went to the <a href=\"/wiki/Moscow_Art_Theater\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Moscow Art Theater\">Moscow Art Theater</a> when his play <i>Mariya</i> was being given its first reading, and when he returned home he told me that all the actresses had been impatient to find out what the leading female role was like and who would be cast in it.
