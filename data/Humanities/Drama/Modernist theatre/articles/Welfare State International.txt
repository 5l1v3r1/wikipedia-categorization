Welfare State International was a British experimental theatre group formed in 1968 by John Fox  and Sue Gill , Roger Coleman  and others.  It became "A collective of radical artists and thinkers who explored ideas of celebratory art and spectacle between 1968 and 2006."  The company's name was originally 'The Welfare State', based on the concept of offering art for all on the same basis as education and health.    Welfare State International was initially known for staging large-scale outdoor spectacular events. At this time (the late 1960s), forsaking theatres and galleries for the street was unusual. In November 2001, Welfare State International was described by the Guardian Guide as "Britain's foremost arts and installations collective."  Welfare State International's 'The Raising of the Titanic' (Limehouse Basin, London, 1983) has been listed among "Productions that transformed theatre".  Welfare State International ceased operating on April Fools' Day 2006 after a performance at Ulverston.
