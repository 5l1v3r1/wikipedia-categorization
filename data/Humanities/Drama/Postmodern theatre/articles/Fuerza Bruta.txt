Fuerza Bruta is a postmodern theatre show that originated in Buenos Aires in 2003 and was created by Diqui James. It is also the name of the company that brings the show. Members of the company that created Fuerza Bruta were co-creators of a previous company called De La Guarda, which presented a similar show named Villa Villa. It is a very energetic spectacle under the motto Brute Force, features interaction between the performers and the public, and is described as a 360 degree experience. The show has been running downtown, Off-Broadway in New York at the Daryl Roth Theater since 2007. The New York cast has been extended to 16 people, and more than 500,000 people have seen the show. The show has since travelled over the world. It has been performed in Buenos Aires, Cordoba, Bogota, Queretaro, Miami, Chicago, Lisbon, Bilbao, Berlin, Moscow, Shanghai, London, Edinburgh, Antwerp, Lima, Taiwan,  and Madrid and is scheduled for Istanbul, Tel Aviv, Manila, Tokyo,  Limerick and Heerlen.
