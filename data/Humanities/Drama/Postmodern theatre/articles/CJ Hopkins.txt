CJ Hopkins (born 1961) is a contemporary American playwright, novelist, and political satirist. His award-winning stage plays have been produced internationally.

His debut novel, Zone 23, was published in 2017 by Snoggsworthy, Swaine & Cormorant. Hopkins' early plays and experimental theatre texts were first produced in New York City during the 1990s at Off-Off-Broadway theatres including HERE Arts Center, the Ohio Theatre, Theatre for the New City, Manhattan Theatre Source, The Present Company Theatorium and The New York International Fringe Festival. He was a 1994 Drama League of New York Developing Artist Fellow and a 1995 Resident Artist/Jerome Foundation Fellow at Mabou Mines/Suite.
