His mother died when he was nine, and the year after, his father remarried the celebrated Charlotta Ficker of the Royal Dramatic Theatre. She encouraged Knut in his interest for the theatre, and after his graduation in 1848, they convinced his father about his preference.

He was employed at the theatre Mindre teatern in Stockholm in 1861, and in the Royal Dramatic Theatre in 1863.   He was regarded to have a natural way of acting and was referred to as a genius in comedy.  In 1874–77, he was joint principal of Dramatens elevskola with his wife.  He took the death of his wife 1882 very hard and retired from the theatre, but continued to act as a guest artist until 1897.
