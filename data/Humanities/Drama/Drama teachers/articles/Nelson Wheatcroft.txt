He was married to Adeline Stanhope(Wheatcroft)(1856–1935).  Their son Stanhope Wheatcroft (1888–1966) was a silent film actor.  He was born Christopher William Wheatcroft to William Wheatcroft and Emily Susanna Nelson. He changed his first name to his mother's maiden name.

He met Adeline Stanhope, a married woman whose husband was Thomas Amory Sullivan. They had two sons Stanhope and Barry Sullivan. While the elder Sullivan went to America Nelson and Adeline began a relationship. Sullivan returned from America and discovered his wife's adultery with Nelson Wheatcroft. After divorcing from Sullivan in 1882, Adeline in 1886 married Nelson Wheatcroft with whom she had a son, Stanhope Nelson Wheatcroft b.1888.
