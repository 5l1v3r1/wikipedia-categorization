However, the most significant contribution has been attributed to an anonymous author known as the \"Wakefield Master.\" It is believed that his additions include <i>Noah, The First Shepherds' Play, The Second Shepherds' Play, Herod the Great and The Buffeting of Christ.</i> This common authorship is suspected due to a unique thirteen-line rhymed stanza, which is evident in all five texts.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The term \"Wakefield Master\" emerged from a need to distinguish some material in the Towneley manuscript from a mass of unexceptional material, and was first coined by <a href=\"/wiki/Charles_Mills_Gayley\" title=\"Charles Mills Gayley\">Charles Mills Gayley</a>. In 1903, Gayley and Alwin Thaler published an anthology of criticism and dramatic selections entitled <i>Representative English Comedies</i>.  It had long been believed that the Towneley Play was a mediocre work that showed extensive borrowing from other sources but containing vibrant and exciting material, apparently by one author, who was responsible for four or five complete pageants and extensive revisions.  Gayley refers to this person as the \"master\" (with a lowercase <i>m</i>) in the book.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>  Then in a 1907 article, Gayley emended this to \"The Wakefield Master,\" the name which is still frequently used.\n</p><p>Within the Broadview Anthology of Medieval Drama, Christina M. Fitzgerald and John T. Sebastian find it important to note, \"the quotation marks placed around the name 'Wakefield Master' are thus to be taken to indicate that the ascription of authorship is the product of convention, rather than proven fact. All that can be said with confidence is that there seems clearly to have been a common force involved in the shaping of all five of these plays.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\"\n</p><p>The most obvious of these characteristics is that several of the pageants use a distinctive stanza, sometimes called the Wakefield Stanza (see below). The pageants that manifest the Wakefield Stanza are noted for comedy, social satire, and intense psychological realism.  These qualities also show up throughout the Towneley Cycle, most often where it seems to depart from its presumed sources.\n</p><p>Some question the existence of one \"Wakefield Master\", and propose that multiple authors could have written in the Wakefield Stanza. Barbara Palmer suggests that the story of the Wakefield Master and the suggestion that the Second Shepherd's Play was performed as part of the Wakefield Cycle were both inventions of an amateur historian named J. M. W. Walker. However, scholars and literary critics find it useful to hypothesize a single talent behind them, due to the unique poetic qualities of the works ascribed to him.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Staging\">Staging</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Wakefield_Mystery_Plays&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Staging\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>There is widespread disagreement among scholars concerning the staging of the Wakefield Cycle, and of mystery plays in general.  It is known that the cycle at York was staged on wagons that moved from place to place in the city, with multiple plays staged simultaneously in different locales in the city.  However, there is disagreement as to whether the Wakefield plays were performed in a similar manner.\n</p><p>One problem is the population of Wakefield in 1377, which is approximately the date of the first performance of the plays. It consisted of 567 people aged sixteen or older. Assuming that half were male, that leaves only about 280 men to play the 243 roles in the plays. This leaves many to believe that multiple plays were performed by the same cast during most of the lifetime of the cycle.\n</p><p>Another way in which the Wakefield cycle differed in its staging from other cycles is that lack of association with the guilds.  In other towns York and <a href=\"/wiki/Coventry\" title=\"Coventry\">Coventry</a> certain plays were staged by different guilds, according to their specialty (such as the shipwrights staging the <a href=\"/wiki/Noah\" title=\"Noah\">Noah</a> play).  Although the names of four guilds are found on the manuscript (the <a href=\"/wiki/Tanning_(leather)\" title=\"Tanning (leather)\">barkers</a>, glovers, litsters, and fishers), they are found in a later hand than most of the manuscript.  This has led some to believe that for its entire lifetime, the Wakefield Cycle was sponsored and produced by other associations, either governmental or religious.  Either way, it was surely performed by non-professional actors from the community, as were all the cycles.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Wakefield_Stanza\">Wakefield Stanza</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Wakefield_Mystery_Plays&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Wakefield Stanza\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The most notable poetic innovation in the manuscript is called the Wakefield Stanza, which is found in the Noah play, the two shepherds' plays, the Herod play, and the Buffeting of Christ pageant. This unique characteristic may be described as:\n</p><p>a nine-line stanza containing one quatrain with internal rhyme and a tail-rhymed cauda, rhyming AAAABCCCB; or, a thirteen-line stanza containing a cross-rhymed octet frons, a tercet cauda with tail-rhymes, the whole rhyming ABABABABCDDDC.\n</p><p>The former description was based upon the earliest editions of the play that reflected the space-saving habits of the medieval scribe, who often wrote two verse-lines on a single manuscript line.  Thus, depending upon how one interprets the manuscript, a stanza (from the Noah pageant) might appear in either of the following forms:\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n<dl><dd>The thryd tyme wille I prufe what depnes we bere</dd>\n<dd>Now long shalle thou hufe, lay in thy lyne there.</dd>\n<dd>I may towch with my hufe the grownd evyn here.</dd>\n<dd>Then begynnys to grufe to us mery chere;\n<dl><dd>Bot, husband,\n<dl><dd>What grownd may this be?</dd>\n<dd>The hyllys of Armonye.</dd>\n<dd>Now blissid be he</dd></dl></dd>\n<dd>That thus for us can ordand.</dd></dl></dd></dl>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<dl><dd>The thryd tyme wille I prufe</dd>\n<dd>what depnes we bere</dd>\n<dd>Now long shalle thou hufe,</dd>\n<dd>lay in thy lyne there.</dd>\n<dd>I may towch with my hufe</dd>\n<dd>the grownd evyn here.</dd>\n<dd>Then begynnys to grufe</dd>\n<dd>to us mery chere;\n<dl><dd>Bot, husband,\n<dl><dd>What grownd may this be?</dd>\n<dd>The hyllys of Armonye.</dd>\n<dd>Now blissid be he</dd></dl></dd>\n<dd>That thus for us can ordand.</dd></dl></dd></dl>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(All the punctuation and indentations are editorial and not part of the original manuscript.)\n</p><p>In the first case above, the first four lines contain internal <a href=\"/wiki/Rhyme\" title=\"Rhyme\">rhyme</a> (i.e., \"prufe,\" \"hufe,\" \"hufe,\" and \"grufe\"); but the second example arranges the same verses in shorter lines, which in the manuscript are separated from one another by apparently random use of the obelus (\u00f7), virgules [/], double-virgules[//], and line-breaks.  In the second example, it is readily seen that the poet uses a cross-rhymed octet frons with a five-line tail-rhymed cauda.  It is this innovative use of the cauda that is most distinctive in the stanza.\n</p><p>There is some disagreement over whether the Wakefield Stanza is nine or thirteen lines long. Owing largely to <a href=\"/wiki/Arthur_Clare_Cawley\" title=\"Arthur Clare Cawley\">A.C.Cawley</a>'s 1957 edition of five of the pageants, and to others' arrangement of the manuscript lines, this is sometimes thought to be a nine-line stanza, with the quatrain containing internal rhyme.  This view predominated in the critical literature until the late twentieth century, and has fallen out of favor.  When Cawley himself edited the entire cycle with Martin Stevens for publication in 1994, the two opted to present the lines as a thirteen-line stanza.  In any case, the number of syllables in the lines is variable, and the number of stressed syllables can usually be counted at two or three per line in the thirteen-line version.\n</p><p>Since the Towneley Play was a drama and therefore spoken rather than read silently, to some degree this presentation of the poetic units in graphical form is somewhat arbitrary and inconsequential.  But it does provide insights into the poetic influences and innovations of the Wakefield Master.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Protestant_alterations\">Protestant alterations</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Wakefield_Mystery_Plays&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Protestant alterations\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In 1576, the Wakefield plays were altered by the <a href=\"/wiki/Protestant\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Protestant\">Protestant</a> authorities, before being discontinued completely. \"In that year, the Diocesan Court of High Commission at York revealed their attitude to the citizens of Wakefield in no uncertain terms.
