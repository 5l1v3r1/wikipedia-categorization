Using the framework of his own desire to have a <a href=\"/wiki/Limousine\" title=\"Limousine\">limousine</a> drive him to and from his job at <a href=\"/wiki/NBC\" title=\"NBC\">NBC</a>, the network which broadcasts the program, Franken attacked network president <a href=\"/wiki/Fred_Silverman\" title=\"Fred Silverman\">Fred Silverman</a> for NBC's poor showing in the <a href=\"/wiki/Nielsen_ratings\" title=\"Nielsen ratings\">Nielsen ratings</a> during his tenure.

He believed that <i>SNL</i> producer <a href=\"/wiki/Lorne_Michaels\" title=\"Lorne Michaels\">Lorne Michaels</a>, who was in the midst of negotiating a new contract, had orchestrated it as revenge for Silverman's failure to attend a meeting with Michaels to discuss those talks the previous day. After hundreds of letters and postcards were delivered to Silverman's office the following Monday, he refused to accept a letter of apology offered by Franken, whom he said later he had never liked to begin with.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Live_from_New_York_1-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Live_from_New_York-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The commentary, and Silverman's reaction to it, had several effects on the show. Michaels and many of the people associated with the show were emotionally exhausted after five seasons, and he had planned for almost everyone to take some time off. Since the show had been one of NBC's few successes under Silverman, the network wanted it to continue that fall. Franken and his writing partner <a href=\"/wiki/Tom_Davis_(comedian)\" title=\"Tom Davis (comedian)\">Tom Davis</a>, with Michaels' support, had expressed interest in producing the show while Michaels served as its <a href=\"/wiki/Executive_producer\" title=\"Executive producer\">executive producer</a>.

It had made stars of its cast members and spawned blockbuster movies, hit singles and many lines of merchandise. Two of those stars, <a href=\"/wiki/Dan_Aykroyd\" title=\"Dan Aykroyd\">Dan Aykroyd</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/John_Belushi\" title=\"John Belushi\">John Belushi</a>, had left. But all the show's other repertory cast members remained, and midway through the season <a href=\"/wiki/Harry_Shearer\" title=\"Harry Shearer\">Harry Shearer</a> was promoted from featured player status to replace them; although he soon alienated his colleagues with his attitude.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Hill_and_Weingrad_Ch28_4-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Hill_and_Weingrad_Ch28-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> Many of the show's writers, who had long been playing minor roles in sketches, including <a href=\"/wiki/Al_Franken\" title=\"Al Franken\">Al Franken</a> and his longtime partner <a href=\"/wiki/Tom_Davis_(comedian)\" title=\"Tom Davis (comedian)\">Tom Davis</a>, were in turn named as featured players.<sup id=\"cite_ref-SNL_archives_5-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-SNL_archives-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>But behind the scenes many of the cast and crew had grown weary of the show. Their celebrity status led them to keep company with each other, and other celebrities who they had become friends with, so that they would not be mobbed as they often were in public by fans who asked them the same questions over and over. Increasing <a href=\"/wiki/Cocaine\" title=\"Cocaine\">cocaine</a> use, particularly the addictions of <a href=\"/wiki/Garrett_Morris\" title=\"Garrett Morris\">Garrett Morris</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Laraine_Newman\" title=\"Laraine Newman\">Laraine Newman</a>, had exacerbated existing interpersonal friction, and stories of <a href=\"/wiki/Egotism\" title=\"Egotism\">egotistical</a> behavior by the stars began to reach the media. Producer <a href=\"/wiki/Lorne_Michaels\" title=\"Lorne Michaels\">Lorne Michaels</a> had felt it necessary to bring the staff up to <a href=\"/wiki/Mohonk_Mountain_House\" title=\"Mohonk Mountain House\">Mohonk Mountain House</a> in the <a href=\"/wiki/Hudson_Valley\" title=\"Hudson Valley\">Hudson Valley</a> for a weekend retreat before the season, the first time that had been necessary, which the senior cast members declined to attend. Competing network <a href=\"/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company\" title=\"American Broadcasting Company\">ABC</a> had also started a competing sketch-comedy show called <i><a href=\"/wiki/Fridays_(TV_series)\" title=\"Fridays (TV series)\">Fridays</a></i>, putting further pressure on Michaels (who was incensed that it was produced by two other clients of his manager, <a href=\"/wiki/Bernie_Brillstein\" title=\"Bernie Brillstein\">Bernie Brillstein</a>), the cast and crew.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Hill_and_Weingrad_Ch28_4-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Hill_and_Weingrad_Ch28-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Hanging over the show was the question of whether Michaels would renew his contract and continue the show for another season. Many of the cast and crew did not want him to. \"Everyone was looking beyond the show,\" recalled writer <a href=\"/wiki/Alan_Zweibel\" title=\"Alan Zweibel\">Alan Zweibel</a>. Critics complained that, in the absence of its two biggest stars, the show had become less creative, and Lorne joked to the media that that had been his intention all along. \"[It]'s going get worse and worse, and eventually it will never be funny again.\" By Christmas 1979, Michaels' <a href=\"/wiki/Personal_assistant\" title=\"Personal assistant\">assistant</a> Cherie Fortis said, \"everyone just said 'OK, let's get through the rest of this.' People were praying Lorne wouldn't come back. We were waiting for it to end.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-Hill_and_Weingrad_Ch32_6-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Hill_and_Weingrad_Ch32-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Fred_Silverman_and_NBC\">Fred Silverman and NBC</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=A_Limo_For_A_Lame-O&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Fred Silverman and NBC\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Michaels' return did not seem likely. From the beginning of his tenure at NBC, Silverman had been convinced that a weekday <a href=\"/wiki/Variety_show\" title=\"Variety show\">variety show</a> starring <a href=\"/wiki/Gilda_Radner\" title=\"Gilda Radner\">Gilda Radner</a>, who he saw as the next <a href=\"/wiki/Lucille_Ball\" title=\"Lucille Ball\">Lucille Ball</a>, could be a hit. Michaels was less certain. Radner told NBC executives she could not do two series at once and did not want to leave her <i>SNL</i> castmates behind. In November 1979, two weeks after Michaels, who had lost his most important ally at the network when Silverman's predecessor Herb Schlosser, an early supporter of <i>SNL</i>, left, stated his refusal clearly and definitely, Silverman called him to his office once again to try to persuade him to do it. The meeting ended in a <a href=\"/wiki/Shouting_match\" title=\"Shouting match\">shouting match</a>, and Silverman's already somewhat negative view of Michaels became much more severe. Michaels and Radner's aversion to a weekly show, however, did not prevent them from mounting a one-woman Broadway show, later filmed as <i><a href=\"/wiki/Gilda_Live\" title=\"Gilda Live\">Gilda Live</a></i>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Hill_and_Weingrad_Ch32_6-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Hill_and_Weingrad_Ch32-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>While <i>SNL</i>, despite its internal conflicts, was still successful, NBC was not. Shows like <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Tonight_Show_Starring_Johnny_Carson\" title=\"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\">The Tonight Show</a></i> (itself embroiled in a contract dispute with host <a href=\"/wiki/Johnny_Carson\" title=\"Johnny Carson\">Johnny Carson</a> at the same time) were mainstays of the schedule along with <i>SNL</i>, but the network had had very few of the <a href=\"/wiki/Prime_time\" title=\"Prime time\">prime time</a> hits it hoped president <a href=\"/wiki/Fred_Silverman\" title=\"Fred Silverman\">Fred Silverman</a>, known until then for his apparently unerring instinct in understanding what audiences  would watch, would be able to deliver for them as he had for ABC and CBS earlier in the decade.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Hill_and_Weingrad_Ch32_6-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Hill_and_Weingrad_Ch32-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> NBC's weak ratings position was aggravated in early 1980 by its shaky finances\u2014a loss of millions in broadcast fees when President <a href=\"/wiki/Jimmy_Carter\" title=\"Jimmy Carter\">Jimmy Carter</a> decided to <a href=\"/wiki/1980_Summer_Olympics_boycott\" title=\"1980 Summer Olympics boycott\">boycott</a> that year's <a href=\"/wiki/1980_Summer_Olympics\" title=\"1980 Summer Olympics\">Summer Olympics</a> in <a href=\"/wiki/Moscow\" title=\"Moscow\">Moscow</a> in order to protest the <a href=\"/wiki/Soviet_invasion_of_Afghanistan\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Soviet invasion of Afghanistan\">Soviet invasion of Afghanistan</a> the preceding fall, and the failure of <i><a href=\"/wiki/Supertrain\" title=\"Supertrain\">Supertrain</a></i> in spring of 1979, the most expensive series in television history at that point, had pushed the network to the verge of <a href=\"/wiki/Bankruptcy_in_the_United_States\" title=\"Bankruptcy in the United States\">bankruptcy</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Supertrain_fail_7-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Supertrain_fail-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>From the beginning of his tenure at NBC, <a href=\"/wiki/John_Belushi\" title=\"John Belushi\">John Belushi</a> had played Silverman in a series of sketches. While Silverman himself was not fond of them, he knew better than to intervene in one of his network's few hits. He also said later that despite his antipathy, he recognized that Belushi was a talented performer and the impersonation got laughs.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Live_from_New_York_1-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Live_from_New_York-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In the spring of 1980, Michaels began renegotiating his contract. Believing that NBC would, as it had four years earlier, take over <a href=\"/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#The_studio\" title=\"Saturday Night Live\">Studio 8H</a>, where the show was staged, for coverage of <a href=\"/wiki/1980_United_States_presidential_election\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"1980 United States presidential election\">that year's presidential elections</a>, his hope was for a later start to the season, to give everyone a bit more time to rest. When it returned he wanted to totally restructure it, probably with a new cast, and would have filled the role of <a href=\"/wiki/Executive_producer\" title=\"Executive producer\">executive producer</a>, since he had signed a three-picture deal with <a href=\"/wiki/Warner_Brothers\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Warner Brothers\">Warner Brothers</a>, leaving the duties he had handled for the previous five seasons to someone else, possibly Franken and Davis. Most of the cast and crew had wanted to just end the show, but admitted that if Michaels had wanted to continue they would have done so with him. He also had some ideas for side projects, such as <i>Yesterday</i>, a half-hour version of <i>Weekend Update</i> that would air late on weekday nights (an idea soon abandoned when <a href=\"/wiki/Johnny_Carson\" title=\"Johnny Carson\">Johnny Carson</a>, in his contract, effectively got the right to approve any show that came on after his; Carson had never been a great fan of <i>SNL'</i>s style of humor).<sup id=\"cite_ref-Hill_and_Weingrad_Ch32_6-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Hill_and_Weingrad_Ch32-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"May_8_meeting\">May 8 meeting</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=A_Limo_For_A_Lame-O&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: May 8 meeting\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>On May 8, 1980, Michaels and Brillstein had scheduled an afternoon meeting with Silverman and other network executives. Michaels had previously made clear to the network that he was amenable to staying, even at the same salary,<sup id=\"cite_ref-Live_from_New_York_1-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Live_from_New_York-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> as long as the network accommodated his request for a later start to the season, the restructuring of the show, and technical improvements to 8H. Rather than haggle with the network, he had told the executives to get back to him with the best counteroffer they could put together within 24 hours.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Hill_and_Weingrad_Ch32_6-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Hill_and_Weingrad_Ch32-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Silverman had been up all the previous night putting together the network's fall schedule so he could present it to the <a href=\"/wiki/Network_affiliate\" title=\"Network affiliate\">network affiliates</a>' board of governors that morning. That meeting had not gone well; many of the affiliates were disappointed with NBC's performance under Silverman, and some of them were openly talking about changing their affiliation. Silverman skipped the afternoon meeting; Brillstein and Michaels were told only that he was ill, and felt disrespected.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Hill_and_Weingrad_Ch32_6-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Hill_and_Weingrad_Ch32-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>That feeling of disrespect was further intensified by their interactions with the NBC executives who <i>were</i> at the meeting. Irwin Moss, the network's vice president for business affairs, began by noting the $2.5 million NBC had paid, sight unseen, for the broadcast rights to <i>Gilda Live</i>, which had failed commercially and critically. \"So, you're here to gouge us again?\" he joked. Brillstein did not think that was funny. Moss then pulled out a copy of Michaels' most recent contract, and asked him what he wanted.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Hill_and_Weingrad_Ch32_6-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Hill_and_Weingrad_Ch32-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Another shouting match, between Brillstein and Moss, ensued. Both Brillstein and Michaels were stunned by how poorly the executives had prepared themselves. They finally left after Moss refused to commit to anymore than six episodes of a possible prime time series; Brillstein and Michaels had wanted 17. Afterwards, Michaels was convinced his relationship with NBC was, at this point in time, over. \"They would have had to make me feel special [to come back], and they didn't,\" he recalled years later.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Hill_and_Weingrad_Ch32_6-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Hill_and_Weingrad_Ch32-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The next day, Silverman called and apologized for his absence, and rescheduled the meeting for the following Monday.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Live_from_New_York_1-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Live_from_New_York-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> He and Lorne met by themselves that afternoon. Silverman offered Michaels more money, primetime shows, anything he wanted, as long as he'd stay at least nominally involved with <i>Saturday Night Live</i>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Hill_and_Weingrad_Ch32_6-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Hill_and_Weingrad_Ch32-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Commentary\">Commentary</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=A_Limo_For_A_Lame-O&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Commentary\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Franken's was not the first <i>Weekend Update</i> commentary that season to be a self-serving personal attack. Just before Christmas <a href=\"/wiki/Bill_Murray\" title=\"Bill Murray\">Bill Murray</a>, who had felt abandoned when Aykroyd and Belushi left, leaving the show overly reliant on him for the first half of the season, had used the critical and commercial failure of <i><a href=\"/wiki/1941_(film)\" title=\"1941 (film)\">1941</a></i>, Belushi and Aykroyd's first post-<i>SNL</i> film, to taunt them. Murray deliberately misremembered the film's title, and noted that stars <a href=\"/wiki/Carrie_Fisher\" title=\"Carrie Fisher\">Carrie Fisher</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Christopher_Lee\" title=\"Christopher Lee\">Christopher Lee</a> had previously been on the show. \"If you ask me they should never have left,\" he said. \"They wouldn't listen and now they have this Christmas turkey on their hands. And now my two old friends are going to have the most miserable Christmas of their lives.\" He ended by recommending audiences instead go see <i><a href=\"/wiki/Meatballs_(film)\" title=\"Meatballs (film)\">Meatballs</a></i>, his film debut from that summer.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Hill_and_Weingrad_Ch30_8-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Hill_and_Weingrad_Ch30-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Shortly before <a href=\"/wiki/Dress_rehearsal\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Dress rehearsal\">dress rehearsal</a> the next evening for the season's <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/antepenultimate\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikt:antepenultimate\">antepenultimate</a> show hosted by <a href=\"/wiki/Bob_Newhart\" title=\"Bob Newhart\">Bob Newhart</a>, Barbara Gallagher, NBC vice president for late-night and special programming, who had worked for Silverman at ABC as well, was perusing the scripts for that evening's show when she came across Franken's commentary for that night's <i><a href=\"/wiki/Weekend_Update\" title=\"Weekend Update\">Weekend Update</a></i>, where he had increasingly been making appearances that season as the segment's \"social sciences editor\", riffing on the concept of the 1980s as the \"Al Franken Decade\" that he had introduced a few months earlier with the end of the 1970s \"<a href=\"/wiki/The_%22Me%22_Decade_and_the_Third_Great_Awakening\" title=\"The &quot;Me&quot; Decade and the Third Great Awakening\">Me Decade</a>\". In this evening's installment, Franken recounted how, earlier in the week, he had just come up with a great idea for the show while hailing a taxi outside <a href=\"/wiki/Rockefeller_Center\" title=\"Rockefeller Center\">Rockefeller Center</a> when a fan interrupted him, and he forgot it. This led him to wonder why he didn't get limousine service from NBC, while Silverman did, since Franken was on a hit show while the network had done nothing but flounder under Silverman.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Hill_and_Weingrad_Ch32_6-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Hill_and_Weingrad_Ch32-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Knowing how bad the last two days had been for her boss, Gallagher groaned, knowing Silverman would not take this well. After dress, where the commentary drew voluminous laughter from the audience, she went to Michaels, who agreed that it might have been too much (he had not thought it funny when Franken read it to him, but allowed it since it only took up two minutes of airtime). He refused to remove it from the show since that was not how he ran things, and suggested she talk to Franken personally.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Hill_and_Weingrad_Ch32_6-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Hill_and_Weingrad_Ch32-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> \"Fred's in a really bad way,\" she told him, \"and this is really going to hurt him.\" She claimed later that Franken responded \"Good, because he hurt Lorne.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-Live_from_New_York_1-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Live_from_New_York-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Michaels assured Gallagher and <a href=\"/wiki/Brandon_Tartikoff\" title=\"Brandon Tartikoff\">Brandon Tartikoff</a>, NBC vice president for comedy programming, who was also present, that Franken would nevertheless comply with her request and tone the commentary down. Lorne suggested that they still might want to warn Silverman that the attack was coming, as the show had done in past seasons with the Belushi sketches.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Hill_and_Weingrad_Ch32_6-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Hill_and_Weingrad_Ch32-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> But whereas in those situations one of Michaels' assistants had called one of Silverman's, on a Saturday night the only way to warn Silverman would have been to call him at his own home and speak to him personally, which neither of them did. Michaels believed that both Gallagher and Tartikoff were afraid to talk to Silverman, who as the pressures on him increased with NBC's failures had been screaming at his subordinates more and more frequently.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Live_from_New_York_1-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Live_from_New_York-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>When the segment actually aired, it was apparent that Franken had responded to Gallagher's plea by making the criticism of Silverman even harsher. Beginning as he had by moving from the \"Al Franken Decade\" to his travails while hailing the cab, he then moved to noting who else at NBC got their own limousines\u2014other members of the show's cast and stars of other shows like <a href=\"/wiki/Gary_Coleman\" title=\"Gary Coleman\">Gary Coleman</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Tom_Snyder\" title=\"Tom Snyder\">Tom Snyder</a>.

It had barely ended when, <a href=\"/wiki/Warren_Littlefield\" title=\"Warren Littlefield\">Warren Littlefield</a> later recalled, an <a href=\"/wiki/NBC_page\" title=\"NBC page\">NBC page</a> came up to Tartikoff and told him he had a phone call. \"Who is it?\" the executive asked. \"A screaming Mr. Silverman\" responded the page. Tartikoff asked the page if he had told Silverman whether he knew where Tartikoff was. \"No,\" the page answered, \"we were just told to find you.\" Tartikoff then told the page to say that he couldn't be found. \"He just couldn't take Fred screaming at him at that hour,\" Littlefield recalled. \"We always thought that was a wonderful lesson that Brandon was imparting to us about survival in the executive ranks.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-Live_from_New_York_1-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Live_from_New_York-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Silverman thought that Michaels had deliberately allowed Franken's attack on him to air as retaliation for the missed Thursday meeting. Reflecting on the episode later, Michaels said that allegation was difficult to respond to \"What are you going to say\u2014that it wasn't me? Then he'd think I was such a wuss that I'd allow Al Franken to just steamroll me against my own career instincts.\" But he agreed too much damage had been done to easily undo. \"The upshot of it all was that Fred took it personally, and that put a further strain on the relations between him and me, and we never did meet.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-Live_from_New_York_1-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Live_from_New_York-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>\"I don't think Lorne put the sketch in there to be mean,\" Silverman said, also with years of reflection. \"He never did a sketch to be mean.

This further infuriated the executive, and it was suggested that Franken apologize, which he did by internal <a href=\"/wiki/Memorandum\" title=\"Memorandum\">memorandum</a>. \"I did not intend to hurt or offend you with this, admittedly, frontal attack.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-Inside_joke_10-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Inside_joke-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Instead, Franken urged Silverman to see how he had intended the piece, characterizing it as \"brazen small guy attacks the boss.\" He asked that Silverman \"step back and think of the Fred Silverman I talked about as 'the boss' instead of as Fred Silverman, your mother's son, your wife's husband and your children's father.\" He believed it actually made NBC and Silverman look good as \"even the most pointed criticism was allowed on the air by the network and by you, the boss.\" Franken further implored Silverman not to blame Lorne, who often allowed material on the show that he himself did not personally see the humor of in the name of creative freedom.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Inside_joke_10-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Inside_joke-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Silverman was unmoved. \"I never liked Al Franken to begin with\" he admitted later. \"I thought this piece [he] did was just very mean-spirited and not very funny.\" He recalled writing back to Franken, saying that \"in no uncertain terms that I thought that what he did was way off base and that I wasn't going to forget it.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-Live_from_New_York_1-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Live_from_New_York-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"June_2_meeting\">June 2 meeting</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=A_Limo_For_A_Lame-O&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: June 2 meeting\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Tartikoff told Michaels afterwards that Franken had lost any chance of succeeding him. But he continued to hold out the hope that Michaels himself might yet be persuaded to return in some capacity, as he had suggested he might. The season finale, two weeks later, did little to foster those hopes. While host <a href=\"/wiki/Buck_Henry\" title=\"Buck Henry\">Buck Henry</a>, doing that duty for what turned out to be the last time, emphatically denied (to loud applause) that the show was ending and even paraded a purported \"new cast\" (actually longtime backstage crewmembers) across the stage during his opening monologue, the end sent a different message, as the \"On Air\" sign outside the studio, the show's traditional final shot, flickered and then darkened. Michaels had also left all the castmembers a gift, a cigarette lighter shaped like the 30 Rock building where the show was produced, inscribed with \"Nice working with you 1975\u20131980\". He had never done that in previous seasons.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Hill_and_Weingrad_Ch33_11-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Hill_and_Weingrad_Ch33-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Whatever message Michaels was sending, the network very much wanted the show to continue. Tartikoff and Gallagher met with Michaels for the last time at the beginning of June. All the producer would promise was that \"even if I don't come back, I'll do my very best to make sure the show doesn't fall apart.\" They assumed that meant he had no one in mind beyond Franken and Davis, both now off the list, to succeed him that he would recommend.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Hill_and_Weingrad_Ch33_11-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Hill_and_Weingrad_Ch33-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>However, he had also made it known that he felt any replacement producer had to be a writer, because he believed that in comedy it took a writer, particularly one with credits, to be able to tell other writers with large egos what was and wasn't funny. Silverman, for his part, had also told his executives that a new producer for <i>SNL</i> had to come from within the group of people already working for the show, as he did not believe an outsider would have credibility with the people Michaels had hired and nurtured. So, during the meeting, it was suggested that longtime associate producer <a href=\"/wiki/Jean_Doumanian\" title=\"Jean Doumanian\">Jean Doumanian</a>, a good friend of Gallagher's, be promoted to the top job.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Hill_and_Weingrad_Ch33_11-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Hill_and_Weingrad_Ch33-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Michaels immediately rejected the idea. Pressed by Gallagher, he explained that Doumanian wasn't a producer, that she had never been part of the show's \"core team\", and that nobody who ever had been would work for her.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Hill_and_Weingrad_Ch33_11-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Hill_and_Weingrad_Ch33-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> He had also invited her to come work for him if he landed a deal with <a href=\"/wiki/Paramount_Pictures\" title=\"Paramount Pictures\">Paramount Pictures</a> he had been considering. He reminded the two executives that she had never been present for any last-minute meetings held between dress and air.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Live_from_New_York_1-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Live_from_New_York-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Michaels' reservations about Doumanian's ability to work with the core team were rooted in fact. Doumanian had a longtime friendship with <a href=\"/wiki/Woody_Allen\" title=\"Woody Allen\">Woody Allen</a>, whose movies she would later produce, and they spoke on the telephone almost every day, often more than once.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Hill_and_Weingrad_Ch34_12-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Hill_and_Weingrad_Ch34-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> He would sometimes call her in the Studio 8H using the <a href=\"/wiki/Pseudonym\" title=\"Pseudonym\">pseudonym</a> \"Mo Golden\", which eventually fooled no one, and <a href=\"/wiki/Production_assistant\" title=\"Production assistant\">production assistants</a> answering the phone would call to her across the room that Allen was on the phone for her,<sup id=\"cite_ref-Live_from_New_York_1-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Live_from_New_York-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> until she told them to stop. Her friendship with Allen, however, never resulted in him appearing on the show as he did not do television at that point in his career.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Hill_and_Weingrad_Ch34_12-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Hill_and_Weingrad_Ch34-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Al Franken in particular disliked Doumanian. She had ostensibly produced a primetime special with <a href=\"/wiki/Bob_and_Ray\" title=\"Bob and Ray\">Bob and Ray</a>, whose humor was especially adored by many of the <i>SNL</i> writers and performers, earlier that season. On the basis of a small contribution to one sketch, Doumanian had decided to award herself a writers' credit. Franken had seen it and crossed her name out, assuming it was a mistake. She later reinserted it, and when Franken came to her over the apparent mistake, she insisted on taking it.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Hill_and_Weingrad_Ch34_12-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Hill_and_Weingrad_Ch34-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Hiring_of_Jean_Doumanian\">Hiring of Jean Doumanian</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=A_Limo_For_A_Lame-O&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Hiring of Jean Doumanian\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Tartikoff decided there was no chance of persuading Michaels to return.

She again made the case for her friend Doumanian. Whatever Michaels had said, she told Tartikoff, Doumanian was indeed an important member of the <i>SNL</i> team\u2014as one of the show's associate producers she knew how the show was put together and run, and she knew enough of the other people to provide the continuity Silverman wanted. The previous year, she had produced a special with <a href=\"/wiki/Bob_and_Ray\" title=\"Bob and Ray\">Bob and Ray</a>, of whom many of the <i>SNL</i> creative team were fans, that came in under budget,<sup id=\"cite_ref-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">&#91;Note 1&#93;</a></sup> Gallagher noted. Lastly, since it was likely all or most of the cast would be new, the new producer would need to be good at evaluating new talent\u2014which, she said, Doumanian had been doing already as the show's talent coordinator.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Hill_and_Weingrad_Ch33_11-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Hill_and_Weingrad_Ch33-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-14\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-14\">&#91;Note 2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<div class=\"quotebox pullquote floatleft\" style=\"width:275px;&#32;; background-color: #ccccff;\"><style data-mw-deduplicate=\"TemplateStyles:r856303512\">.mw-parser-output .quotebox{background-color:#F9F9F9;border:1px solid #aaa;box-sizing:border-box;padding:10px;font-size:88%}.mw-parser-output .quotebox.floatleft{margin:0.5em 1.4em 0.8em 0}.mw-parser-output .quotebox.floatright{margin:0.5em 0 0.8em 1.4em}.mw-parser-output .quotebox.centered{margin:0.5em auto 0.8em auto}.mw-parser-output .quotebox.floatleft p,.mw-parser-output .quotebox.floatright p{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .quotebox-title{background-color:#F9F9F9;text-align:center;font-size:larger;font-weight:bold}.mw-parser-output .quotebox-quote.quoted:before{font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;font-weight:bold;font-size:large;color:gray;content:\" \u201c \";vertical-align:-45%;line-height:0}.mw-parser-output .quotebox-quote.quoted:after{font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;font-weight:bold;font-size:large;color:gray;content:\" \u201d \";line-height:0}.mw-parser-output .quotebox .left-aligned{text-align:left}.mw-parser-output .quotebox .right-aligned{text-align:right}.mw-parser-output .quotebox .center-aligned{text-align:center}.mw-parser-output .quotebox cite{display:block;font-style:normal}@media screen and (max-width:360px){.mw-parser-output .quotebox{min-width:100%;margin:0 0 0.8em!important;float:none!important}}</style>\n<div class=\"quotebox-quote quoted center-aligned\" style=\"\">'<i>Limo for a Lame-O' sort of had implications for what happened the next year, because I think it ruptured the relationship between Fred Silverman and Lorne.

But he did not have a much better opinion of Ebersol, who had been in charge of late-night programming for NBC when <i>SNL</i> had been launched in 1975, and thus became \"one of the first people to steal credit for the success of <i>Saturday Night Live</i>.\" He recited a list of failed comedies like <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Waverly_Wonders\" title=\"The Waverly Wonders\">The Waverly Wonders</a></i> that Ebersol had been responsible for, and told the audience the show would improve, but not much.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Moviepilot_piece_3-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Moviepilot_piece-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Instead, Franken suggested, it was time to end the show and its \"tired old format\" altogether.
