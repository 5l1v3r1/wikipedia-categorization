The AFAS Circustheater is a Dutch theatre in Scheveningen, The Hague. The original theatre was opened on July 16, 1904 by Circus Schumann. Designed by architect Wilhelmus Bernardus van Liefland, the building was as a proper circus in the summer seasons until the 1960s. Animals were transported here by train from Den Haag Hollands Spoor railway station. The circus has also carried the name Circus Strassburger, and after the 1960s functioned as a concert hall. Currently the theatre is property of the company Stage Entertainment, founded by Joop van den Ende, who bought the building for the symbolic amount of 1 guilder off the Municipality of The Hague on the condition that it would be converted into a functioning theatre. It is now mainly in use for big musical productions. Caused by change of ownership and sponsorship the theatre underwent multiple name changes.
