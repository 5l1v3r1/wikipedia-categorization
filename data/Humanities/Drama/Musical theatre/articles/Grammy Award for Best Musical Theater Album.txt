The Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album has been awarded since 1959.

The lyricist(s) and composer(s) of a new score are eligible for an Award if they have written and/or composed a new score which comprises 51% or more playing time of the album."

Awards are given in February following the eligibility period. This award has had several minor name changes:
