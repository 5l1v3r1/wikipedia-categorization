A sung-through (also through-sung) musical, musical film, or opera is one with no spoken dialogue, except perhaps for some occasional lines spoken in the course of a song but remaining part of the song's lyrics rather than constituting stand-alone dialogue.  Conversations, speeches, and musings are communicated musically through a combination of recitative, aria, and arioso. Early versions of this include the Italian genre of opera buffa, a light-hearted form of opera that gained prominence in the 1750s.   A through-sung opera or other narrative work with continuous music may also be described as through-composed.
