  Glasgow, the largest city in Scotland, supports a large number of active amateur dramatics and musical theatre companies. Some of the larger companies use the professional stages at the King's Theatre, Theatre Royal and The Pavilion, and in the past the Alhambra Theatre. The Mitchell Theatre, run by Glasgow City Council, is one of the most popularly used theatres for amateur companies, as is the Eastwood Park Theatre operated in the south side.
