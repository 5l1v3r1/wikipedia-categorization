A battle-axe is a term, generally considered pejorative, for an aggressive, domineering and forceful woman.  The prime example was the militant temperance activist Carrie Nation, who wielded a hatchet and made it her symbol, living in Hatchet Hall and publishing a magazine called The Hatchet.  She became involved in the suffragette campaign for votes for women and this campaign further established the archetype.   Other examples, listed by Christine Hamilton in her Book of British Battleaxes, include Nancy Astor, Boudica, Ena Sharples and Ann Widdecombe.  The battleaxe is one of several stereotypes found in nursing â€“ a tyrannical, fierce matron exemplified by Nurse Ratched or Hattie Jacques in popular medical dramas and comedies.   Judith Furse played a "battle-axe woman" in Carry On Cabby.
