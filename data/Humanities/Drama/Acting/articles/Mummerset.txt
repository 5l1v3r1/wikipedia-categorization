Mummerset refers to a fictional rustic English county and, more commonly, to the English dialect supposedly spoken there.   Mummerset is used by actors to represent a stereotypical English West Country accent while not specifically referencing any particular county.  The name is a portmanteau of mummer (an archaic term for a folk actor) and Somerset, a largely rural county.  Mummerset draws on a mixture of characteristics of real dialects from the West Country, such as rhoticism, forward-shifted diphthongs, lengthened vowels, and the voicing of word-initial consonants that are voiceless in other English dialects. Word-initial "S" is replaced with "Z"; "F" is replaced with "V".  It also uses perceived dialect grammar, replacing instances of "am", "are" and "is" with "be". The sentence "I haven't seen him, that  farmer, since Friday" could be parsed in Mummerset as "Oi ain't zeen 'im that be varmer since Vroiday".  In Shakespeare's King Lear, Edgar speaks in Mummerset before he fights Oswald in Act IV, scene 6:   Good gentleman, go your gait, and let poor volk pass. An ’chud ha’ bin zwagger’d out of my life, ’t would not ha’bin zo long as ’tis by a vortnight. Nay, come not near th’ old man; keep out, ’che vor ye, or Ise try whether your costard or my ballow be the harder. ’Chill be plain with you.
