Stunt casting is a term in casting that refers to the use of a gimmick or publicity stunt to fill a role in a television series or film.  Stunt casting can take many forms, ranging from a celebrity or famous non-actor cameo appearance to the use of an actor's real-life relatives to play the corresponding fictional character's relatives. Stunt casting is used to generate media attention.  It may also be employed in order to garner studio support or financing for a project; for example, according to DVD featurette commentary, the 1978 version of Superman received studio support only after the producers were able to enlist A-list actors Marlon Brando and Gene Hackman to appear.
