Topless in Philadelphia is a one man comedy stage play by Miles Tredinnick. It is set on an open-top sightseeing bus and features tour guide Gus Clover revealing his disastrous personal life whilst pointing out the Philly sights. The play is written in the same vein as the author's earlier Topless which features a female tour guide giving a tour of London. An acting edition of Topless in Philadelphia was published by Matador Books in 2009. A Kindle ebook version of the play was published in 2011.
