 "(Can You) Feel the Passion" is a 1991 rave-theme House song recorded, written, and produced by the American/British group Blue Pearl. The single is to date the act's second best known song after Naked In The Rain. Can You Feel The Passion had better success in the United States, hitting No. 1 on both Billboard's Hot Dance Club Play chart  and the UK Dance Chart in 1992, while reaching No. 14 on the UK Singles Chart.  The single is done in a spoken word type manner by lead singer Durga McBroom, while the hook, riffs, and chorus melody provided by Youth on the keyboards samples Bizarre Inc's "Playing with Knives." Ironically, club DJs have used both "(Can You) Feel the Passion" and "Playing With Knives" in their bootleg mashups due to the former providing the lyrics and the latter's piano-heavy house feel.
