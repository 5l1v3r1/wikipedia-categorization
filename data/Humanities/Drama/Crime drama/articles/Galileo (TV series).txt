Galileo (ガリレオ, Garireo) is a Japanese television drama based on Detective Galileo (探偵ガリレオ, Tantei Garireo), a novel by mystery writer Keigo Higashino (東野 圭吾, Higashino Keigo). It narrates the events and cases encountered by Kaoru Utsumi, a rookie detective, and Manabu Yukawa, a university associate professor, as the two pair up to solve many mysterious cases. Galileo SP was aired on October 4, 2008 on the same day as the release of the film The Devotion of Suspect X. A second series began airing on Fuji TV on April 15, 2013 and ended with an adaption of the novel Salvation of a Saint. The second movie, titled Midsummer's Equation (真夏の方程式, Manatsu no hōteishiki, lit. The Equation of Midsummer), premiered in both Japan and Hong Kong on June 29, 2013. Kaoru Utsumi, a rookie detective who has just been reassigned to the criminal division, finds the investigation of her first murder case stalled by seemingly-supernatural phenomena surrounding the event. She seeks help from Shunpei Kusanagi, a senior detective at the police headquarter famous as a "Mystery Hunter". Kusanagi, however, reveals to Utsumi that he was only able to solve the cases thanks to his college friend, Teito University professor Manabu Yukawa. Yukawa is a tall, handsome, brilliant but eccentric scientist who is interested in nothing but physics, while Utsumi is a hot-blooded detective with a strong sense of justice. Together, the odd pair solves many difficult and seemingly impossible events with their individual talents.
