This model was developed by <b>Jeanne R. Steele</b> and <b>Jane D. Brown</b> in 1995, and it takes a practice perspective which means that it focuses on everyday activities and routines of <a href=\"/wiki/Media_consumption\" title=\"Media consumption\">media consumption</a>. This <a href=\"/wiki/Theoretical\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Theoretical\">theoretical</a> framework was developed to better understand what drives <a href=\"/wiki/Teenagers\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Teenagers\">teenagers</a> to pick one media source over another, and what factors play a role in this decision. The Media Practice Model emphasizes the constant interaction between consumers and the media, and focuses on the <a href=\"/wiki/Dialectical\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Dialectical\">dialectical</a> aspect of this interaction, suggesting that it is the adolescents\u2019 individual characteristics, environment and daily practices that allow the media to have stronger or weaker effects on them (Steele &amp; Brown, 1995).<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Origin\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Origin</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Components\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Components</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Development\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Development</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Origin\">Origin</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Media_Practice_Model&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Origin\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The model was developed based on a study that progressed from 1987 through 1993, and used a variety of methods such as daily <a href=\"/wiki/Newspaper\" title=\"Newspaper\">journals</a>, in-depth <a href=\"/wiki/Interviews\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Interviews\">interviews</a>, self-administered <a href=\"/wiki/Questionnaires\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Questionnaires\">questionnaires</a> and \u201croom touring\u201d to understand, as the Steele and Brown call it, the adolescents\u2019 \u201croom <a href=\"/wiki/Culture\" title=\"Culture\">culture</a>.\u201d This environment was chosen based on the facts that adolescents\u2019 bedrooms are usually cluttered with different media materials and sources, as well as the fact that this is a place where adolescents spend a good part of their day. This is also a place that provides an intimate environment where adolescents can experiment with possible selves (Markus &amp; Nurius, 1986).<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> The Media Practice Model was based on the findings of this first study, and the incorporation of other media effects theories such as <a href=\"/wiki/Selective_Exposure_Theory\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Selective Exposure Theory\">Selective Exposure Theory</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Uses_and_Gratifications\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Uses and Gratifications\">Uses and Gratifications</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Framing_(social_sciences)\" title=\"Framing (social sciences)\">Framing</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Cultivation_theory\" title=\"Cultivation theory\">Cultivation theory</a>, and Emotional Conditioning.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Components\">Components</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Media_Practice_Model&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Components\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The Media Practice Model proposed by Steele and Brown has the concepts of selection, <a href=\"/wiki/Interaction\" title=\"Interaction\">interaction</a> and application as the three main components, but also takes into account one\u2019s <a href=\"/wiki/Identity_formation\" title=\"Identity formation\">identity</a> and lived experience. <a href=\"/wiki/Identity_formation\" title=\"Identity formation\">Identity formation</a> is the key component of this model and it represents the main task of adolescent formation (Steele &amp; Brown, 1995). It is believed that adolescents\u2019 sense of who they are influences their interactions with the media, and those interactions in turn influence their sense of who they are, in what Steele and Brown call an ongoing process of <a href=\"/wiki/Cultural\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cultural\">cultural</a> production and reproduction. The <a href=\"/wiki/Theoretical\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Theoretical\">theoretical</a> perspective of \u201c<b>lived through experience</b>\u201d (<a href=\"/wiki/Vygotsky\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Vygotsky\">Vygotsky</a>, 1978),<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> also takes into account the <a href=\"/wiki/Developmental_stage_theories\" title=\"Developmental stage theories\">developmental stage</a>, the <a href=\"/wiki/Sociocultural\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sociocultural\">sociocultural</a> differences based on gender, class, and race, as well as other factors such as <a href=\"/wiki/Religious_beliefs\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Religious beliefs\">religious beliefs</a>, interactions within one\u2019s neighborhood, school, family, friends circle, and so on. This concept of \u201clived experience\u201d emphasizes the idea that adolescents\u2019 interaction with the media does not happen in a vacuum. It is argued that the continuous dialectal relationship between the other four components of the Media Practice Model, selection, interaction, application, and identity, all occur within the context of \u201clived experience (Steele &amp; Brown, 1995).\u201d \n</p><p><br />\n<b>Selection</b>, within the Media Practice Model, is simply defined as the act of choosing among media related alternatives (Steele &amp; Brown, 1995). Selection is influenced by <a href=\"/wiki/Motivation\" title=\"Motivation\">motivations</a>, which in turn affects <a href=\"/wiki/Attention\" title=\"Attention\">attention</a> to the media selected. In this context, the concept of motivation is defined based on previous theories such as <a href=\"/wiki/Selective_exposure_theory\" title=\"Selective exposure theory\">selective exposure</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Uses_and_gratifications_theory\" title=\"Uses and gratifications theory\">uses and gratifications theory</a>. This means that a teenager\u2019s motivation to attend to certain media might be based on <a href=\"/wiki/Affective\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Affective\">affective</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Behavioral\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Behavioral\">behavioral</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Cognitive\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cognitive\">cognitive</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Instrumental_value\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Instrumental value\">instrumental</a> needs, or it could also simply be a result of <a href=\"/wiki/Habituation\" title=\"Habituation\">habituation</a> (Steele &amp; Brown, 1995). As far as factoring in \u201clived experience\u201d, in their initial study Steele and Brown found that selection is also influenced by gender and race. Thus, boys were more likely to be more interested in media that dealt with sports, and this was also reflected in how their rooms were decorated. Also, an African-American girl was more interested in magazines and certain types of music that reflected her <a href=\"/wiki/Ethnic_heritage\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Ethnic heritage\">ethnic heritage</a>. \n</p><p><br />\n<b>Interaction</b> is defined as the <a href=\"/wiki/Cognitive\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cognitive\">cognitive</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Affective\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Affective\">affective</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Behavioral\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Behavioral\">behavioral</a> engagement with the media that produces <a href=\"/wiki/Cultural\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cultural\">cultural</a> meanings, which are affected by adolescents\u2019 evaluation and interpretation of the media content. In terms of practice, interaction was conceptually defined as what is actually happening at the moment adolescent use the media (Steele &amp; Brown, 1995). As noted in the definition, adolescents can interact with the media on different levels such as cognitive (processing information), affective (arousal), or behavioral (dancing, channel surfing, etc.). However, researchers in communication have been more concerned with the cognitive and affective interactions, and adolescents\u2019 evaluation and interpretation of media content are clearly more closely related to those two types of interactions.\n</p>\n<dl><dd><i>Evaluation</i> and <i>interpretation</i> of media content are also believed to play an important role in the process of <a href=\"/wiki/Identity_formation\" title=\"Identity formation\">identity formation</a>. Thus, adolescents are more likely to prefer characters that they can relate to, that match with who they are or would like to become (Steele &amp; Brown, 1995). In their study, Steele and Brown (1995) came across different interpretation and evaluation of the media, as teenagers were trying to make sense of the messages the media were conveying. This process of sense making is sometimes very complex, as teenagers are trying to understand themselves and the world around them by trying to balance their already formed beliefs and worldviews, with the sometimes contradictory messages of the media (Steele &amp; Brown, 1995).</dd></dl>\n<p>The concept of \u201clived experience\u201d was shown to have a role in the interaction component of the model as well. As found by Steele and Brown, <a href=\"/wiki/Racial\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Racial\">racial</a> understanding, class and gender also affected how teenagers interpreted and evaluated the messages conveyed by the media.\n</p><p><b>Application</b> is defined as the <a href=\"/wiki/Concrete_(philosophy)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Concrete (philosophy)\">concrete</a> ways in which adolescents use media in their everyday lives (Steele &amp; Brown, 1995). The Media Practice Model looks at two different types of application: appropriation and incorporation.\n</p>\n<dl><dd><i>Appropriation</i> is an active, <a href=\"/wiki/Intentional\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Intentional\">intentional</a>, easily visible and goal oriented use of the media by adolescents. Steele and Brown (1995) found some typical examples of media appropriation when it comes to teenagers: enhance a mood or cope with feelings; sort through cultural values and norms; make a statement about identity; imitate admired behavior; fantasize about possible selves or situations. <i>Incorporation</i>, on the other hand, is harder to recognize because it is more internal, it is less visible, and most of the times happens <a href=\"/wiki/Unconsciously\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Unconsciously\">unconsciously</a>. Incorporation refers to taking the messages and beliefs conveyed by the media and making them a part of the <a href=\"/wiki/Self\" title=\"Self\">self</a>, building on already existing <a href=\"/wiki/Attitude_(psychology)\" title=\"Attitude (psychology)\">attitudes</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Feeling\" title=\"Feeling\">feelings</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Knowledge\" title=\"Knowledge\">knowledge</a> (Steele &amp; Brown, 1995). In trying to better explain the concept of incorporation, Steele and Brown (1995) build upon other media effects theories such as framing, cultivation, and emotional conditioning.</dd></dl>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Development\">Development</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Media_Practice_Model&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Development\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Based on reviewers\u2019 critiques that the concepts of incorporation and appropriation are one and the same thing, and also based on a new study performed in 1999, Steele slightly revised this component of the Media Practice Model. Based on the study, Steele noticed that within the application component of the model, a new factor stood out: resistance. Resistance was defined as \u201cteens\u2019 practice of using media to open up a space for combating the status quo (Steele, 1999).\u201d This suggests that when adolescents feel marginalized they engage with media that go against the dominant culture. This way they become fans of movies that depict drug usage, are graphically violent or show sexually explicit material, or start listening to less culturally popular genres of music such as <a href=\"/wiki/Hard_rock\" title=\"Hard rock\">hard rock</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Heavy_metal_music\" title=\"Heavy metal music\">heavy metal</a> (Steele, 1999).<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> \n</p><p>Besides contributing to the Media Practice Model through the discussed revision to the application component, Steele\u2019s (1999) study also provided more depth to the \u201clived experience\u201d component. It demonstrated more explicitly how one\u2019s race, gender, and developmental stage plays an important role in their media practices and choices. Also, while acknowledging the importance of media content, this study puts more emphasis on media practice rather than on <a href=\"/wiki/Content_(media)\" title=\"Content (media)\">media content</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Media_effects\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Media effects\">media effects</a>.\n</p><p>Since it was first introduced by Steele and Brown in 1995, and then revised in 1999 by Steele, the Media Practice Model has been used by other researchers in different contexts; however, this model has experienced modest popularity. One of the main drawbacks of this model is its general scope and simplified description of media use. Even so, this model allows for the integration of a whole multitude of variables within its main components, and offers scholars the possibility to use it for more in-depth investigative purposes if desired.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Media_Practice_Model&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Steele, J.R., &amp; Brown, J.D.
