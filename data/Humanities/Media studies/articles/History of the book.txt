The History of the Book is an academic discipline that studies the production, transmission, circulation and dissemination of text from antiquity to the present day. Its scope includes the book as object, the history of ideas, history of religion, bibliography, conservation, curation and the future of the book.  While several Abrahamic religions lay claim to special knowledge or status due to the centrality of a book to their beliefs (which is often referred to as "the book", making adherents "people of the book") the History of the Book as an academic discipline is concerned with book-as-object and embraces scrolls, manuscripts, codices and other vehicles of textual transmission.   The history of the book came into existence in the latter half of the 20th century. It was fostered by William Ivins Jr.'s Prints and Visual Communication (1953) and Henri-Jean Martin and Lucien Febvre's L'apparition du livre (The Coming of the Book: The Impact of Printing, 1450â€“1800) in 1958 as well as Marshall McLuhan's Gutenberg Galaxy: The Making of Typographic Man (1962).  Another notable pioneer in the History of the Book is Robert Darnton.
