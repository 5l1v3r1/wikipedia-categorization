Deep voice privilege, an idea in sociology and psychology, is the privilege that a man gains from having a deeper speaking voice. Our voices are not genetic and are influenced by things, such as "environmental factors play a role in determining how your voice ultimately emerges".  Some of the privileges include attraction from members of the opposite gender, gaining employment opportunities, professionalism, and being a good public speaker. Men with deep voices are considered as "confident, trustworthy, and reliable".  Many sociologists explains "why having a deep voice Is critical for a man's success" in dating, employment, and, even, schooling.  "The deeper-voiced CEOs tend to run the larger firms".
