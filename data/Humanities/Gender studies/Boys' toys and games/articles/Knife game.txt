The knife game, pinfinger, nerve, bishop, stabscotch, five finger fillet (FFF), or "stab between the fingers game", is a game wherein, placing the palm of one's hand down on a table with fingers apart, using a knife (such as a pocket or pen knife), or other sharp object, one attempts to stab back and forth between one's fingers, moving the object back and forth, trying to not hit one's fingers. The game is intentionally dangerous, exposing players to the risk of injury and scarring, and, before antibiotics, an incision or penetration risked sepsis and death. A foldable blade carries the additional danger that, "as the faster you go, the more likely the blade will fold back in on itself trapping the finger of your stabbing hand."  It may be played much more safely by using another object, such as the eraser side of a pencil. In European culture it is traditionally considered a boys' game.    However, its focus on motor coordination and dexterity is comparable to girls' clapping games.  Among our rowdy amusements [exiled in Siberia] was a popular knife game. You place the palm of your hand flat on a table with fingers apart. Then you stab back and forth between the fingers, trying not to hit them. The faster you stab, the better, and the fastest one wins. I still have a visible scar...as a reminder of this game.

One of our pocketknife games was...mumbly-peg....A more dangerous game was just called the Knife Game, also sometimes known as the FFF (five-finger fillets). This game challenged your coordination as you tried to stab a knife between your outstretched fingers while holding your palm down on the ground or on a table. Whoever could do that the fastest in an allotted time was the winner. The loser was the slowestâ€”or the one who stabbed his hand or finger. I was the big loser one time,...it left an obvious scar...displaying validation of rituals confirming manhood.The order in which the spaces between the fingers are stabbed varies. In the following examples, the spaces are numbered 1 is in between the index finger and thumb. The most popular version is to simply stab all the spaces in order, starting from behind the thumb to after the little finger, and back again ("In its simplest form, one would simply move as fast as one dared backwards and forwards." ): A more complex order is also common ("Those with stronger nerves could stab according to a sequence" ): or an even more complex order: In Australia this order is used.
