On February 9, 1965, The National Society of Pershing Angels were formally recognized as a university organization and as a sister unit to Pershing Rifles Company J-8 (then H-15) at Morgan.   Across the Nation other women's affiliates of Pershing Rifles formed during the early 60’s.  Pershing Angels was one of many similar coed affiliates with the same ideals and drill activities recognized by local Pershing Rifles Companies, but not officially sanctioned by Pershing Rifles National Headquarters.  Pershing Angles became part of the Coed Affiliates Pershing Rifles (CAPERS) in 1966 when CAPERS were formed as the first officially recognized nationwide female auxiliary to the National Society of Pershing Rifles. Pershing Rifles began accepting women as members as early as 1971, but CAPERS continued on until the mid-1980s.  Once CAPERS were disbanded, Pershing Angels units formerly affiliated with CAPERS chose to continue on as a separate organization. Over the years Pershing Angels have expanded to other Universities which included Company C-16, Florida A&M University, Company C-15, Norfolk State College (presently Co. R-4-5, Norfolk State University), Hampton (Institute) University, and Howard University.
