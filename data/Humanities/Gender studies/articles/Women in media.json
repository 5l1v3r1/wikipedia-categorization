Across all these issues, women do not enjoy full equality with men, nor do they have their work valued to the same extent as men.

This ongoing issue appears to have stagnated in recent years. The <a href=\"/wiki/Internet_Governance_Forum\" title=\"Internet Governance Forum\">Internet Governance Forum</a> (IGF) Dynamic Coalition on Gender and Internet Governance, which pushes for recognition of the gendered issues relating to internet governance, reports that although women's participation at the 2015 IGF reached close to parity, women were still underrepresented in discussion and debates: only 37 per cent of panelists were women, a decline from 40 per cent the previous year.<sup id=\"cite_ref-22\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-22\">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In organizations, such as the Internet Association for Assigned Names and Numbers (<a href=\"/wiki/ICANN\" title=\"ICANN\">ICANN</a>), senior <a href=\"/wiki/Leadership\" title=\"Leadership\">leadership</a> positions remain largely dominated by men.

The limitations of work practices to address gender inequalities do not reflect a lack of advocacy as there is evidence of a growing commitment towards gender equality on the part of media organizations.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Media_monitoring_and_advocacy\">Media monitoring and advocacy</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Women_in_media&amp;action=edit&amp;section=17\" title=\"Edit section: Media monitoring and advocacy\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In addition to the Global Media Monitoring Project, there are several regional initiatives which regularly monitor gendered aspects of the media, some of which also work with journalists to promote change within newsrooms.\n</p><p>The South Africa-based Gender Links, formed in 2001 to promote \u2018gender equality in and through the media\u2019 in Southern Africa, leads the media cluster of the Southern Africa Gender Protocol Alliance. Gender Links promotes media advocacy through global initiatives such as the Global Alliance on Media and Gender (GAMAG), hosting gender and media summits, developing policy in collaboration with regulators and working with media organizations through training and policy development. Gender Links is currently developing Centres of Excellence for Gender in the Media in 108 Newsroom across Southern Africa.\n</p><p>In 2016, the <a href=\"/wiki/World_Association_for_Christian_Communication\" title=\"World Association for Christian Communication\">World Association for Christian Communication</a> (WACC), the Global Media Monitoring Project (GMMP) Network and other partners launched a campaign to end news media sexism by 2020. The \u2018End News Media Sexism\u2019 campaign encourages and supports advocacy initiatives that promote changes in media policies and journalism practice. The campaign is taking a multi-disciplinary approach and uses a variety of different tools to promote awareness, including a gender scorecard against which media organizations are measured.\n</p><p>The <a href=\"/wiki/FEMNET\" title=\"FEMNET\">African Women's Development and Communication Network</a> (FEMNET), founded in 1988 as part of a broader project to promote women's empowerment in Africa, prioritizes women's development in the field of communication, where they have created and managed platforms to share information, ideas, strategies and experiences to foster cross-learning and more effective implementation of shared goals. FEMNET provides strategic policy recommendations through the production of reports and policy briefs. It has led extensive local <a href=\"/wiki/Capacity_building\" title=\"Capacity building\">capacity building</a> initiatives, such as facilitating women's access to <a href=\"/wiki/Information_and_communications_technology\" title=\"Information and communications technology\">ICTs</a> in Africa. In Asia, the South Asia Women's Network (SWAN) has rolled out a research project titled \u2018Women for Change: Building a Gendered Media in South Asia\u2019. Covering nine South Asian countries, it is partly supported by UNESCO\u2019s <a href=\"/wiki/International_Programme_for_the_Development_of_Communication\" title=\"International Programme for the Development of Communication\">International Programme for the Development of Communication</a>.\n</p><p>In addition, a number of national organizations work locally to redress the disparity in women's representation and participation in the media. Women, Media and Development (known by its <a href=\"/wiki/Arabic\" title=\"Arabic\">Arabic</a> acronym TAM) is a Palestine-based organization founded in 2004. TAM works with local women to promote their increased representation in the media and to foster an environment where they are able to effectively communicate and advocate for their rights. TAM provides training for women on how to access and use various media platforms, in addition to promoting community awareness and advocacy initiatives. TAM has facilitated capacity building and worked to counter stereotypes of women in the media by producing gender sensitive guides and training manuals, in addition to implementing projects that aim to increase women's access to decision-making positions and <a href=\"/wiki/Civic_engagement\" title=\"Civic engagement\">civic participation</a>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Formal_and_informal_professional_associations\">Formal and informal professional associations</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Women_in_media&amp;action=edit&amp;section=18\" title=\"Edit section: Formal and informal professional associations\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>A number of formal and informal networks of women media professionals also support women in the media. One of the oldest is the <a href=\"/wiki/Alliance_for_Women_in_Media\" title=\"Alliance for Women in Media\">Alliance for Women in Media</a> (AWM), originally established in 1951 as American Women in Radio and television, which supports women across all media to expand their networks, participate in training and professional development and celebrate their talents.<sup id=\"cite_ref-53\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-53\">&#91;53&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In 1975, it began its annual programme of awards to recognize the work of programme-makers and content-providers in promoting women and women\u2019s issues. A more regionally focused example is the <a href=\"/wiki/Marie_Colvin\" title=\"Marie Colvin\">Marie Colvin</a> Journalists\u2019 Network, a bilingual Arabic-English online community of women journalists working in the <a href=\"/wiki/Arab_world\" title=\"Arab world\">Arab world</a> that aims to assist vulnerable local <a href=\"/wiki/Women_in_journalism\" title=\"Women in journalism\">women journalists</a> who lack support in relation to safety training, legal contracts, insurance or <a href=\"/wiki/Psychology\" title=\"Psychology\">psychological</a> care.<sup id=\"cite_ref-54\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-54\">&#91;54&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Media unions at local, regional and global levels have established caucuses for women and have campaigned to encourage more women to stand for elected office within formal union structures. In 2001, the <a href=\"/wiki/International_Federation_of_Journalists\" title=\"International Federation of Journalists\">International Federation of Journalists</a> found that women represented 29 per cent of union membership in 38 countries but just 17 per cent of members on union governing bodies: in its 2010 report, it found that women\u2019s representation on boards had increased only slightly, to 15 per cent. In Europe, between 2006 and 2013, women\u2019s union membership went down from 45 per cent to 42 per cent and board membership also declined, from 39 per cent to 36 per cent.<sup id=\"cite_ref-55\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-55\">&#91;55&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sources\">Sources</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Women_in_media&amp;action=edit&amp;section=19\" title=\"Edit section: Sources\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/File:Definition_of_Free_Cultural_Works_logo_notext.svg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Definition of Free Cultural Works logo notext.svg\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Definition_of_Free_Cultural_Works_logo_notext.svg/12px-Definition_of_Free_Cultural_Works_logo_notext.svg.png\" width=\"12\" height=\"12\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Definition_of_Free_Cultural_Works_logo_notext.svg/18px-Definition_of_Free_Cultural_Works_logo_notext.svg.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Definition_of_Free_Cultural_Works_logo_notext.svg/24px-Definition_of_Free_Cultural_Works_logo_notext.svg.png 2x\" data-file-width=\"219\" data-file-height=\"218\" /></a>&#160;This article incorporates text from a <a href=\"/wiki/Free_content\" title=\"Free content\">free content</a> work.

The first GMMP report was in 1995 and the most recent one (in 2015) published its findings in November 2015. The Project provides comparative data across time and region. Teams in 114 countries who monitored 22,136 stories published, broadcast or tweeted by 2,030 distinct media outlets carried out the 2015 report. In sum, data were collected on the work of 26,010 journalists and the representation of 45,402 individuals who featured in or were quoted in the stories.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-38\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-38\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Harp, Dustin, Ingrid Bachmann, and Jaime Loke. 2014.
