Founded in 1975, the Committee to Ratify the Massachusetts State Equal Rights Amendment sought to replace the Massachusetts State ERA Coalition and carry out the mission of ratifying the Equal Rights Amendment. The Committee to Ratify the Massachusetts State Equal Rights Amendment replaced the Massachusetts State ERA Coalition because, as a coalition, the organization could not legally raise funds for any cause. The campaign created by the Committee ended with success at the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment.  The Committee then became the ERA Implementation Project, which lobbied for reconciliation of existing laws with the ERA vis a vis legislation.
