Philandry is fondness, love, or admiration towards men.   Its antonym is misandry. Philandry is not to be confused with androphilia, which is sexual attraction to men or masculinity (and whose antonym is androphobia). Philandry comes from philo- (loving) and Greek andro (man). The parallel Greek-based terms with respect to women (females) are philogyny for "fondness towards women" and misogyny for "hatred of women". Parallel terms for humanity in general are philanthropy and misanthropy.
