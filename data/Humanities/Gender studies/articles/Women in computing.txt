Women in computing have shaped the evolution of the industry, with women among the first programmers during the early 20th century.  Nevertheless, much recorded history of the field downplayed women's achievements.  In the 2000s, women have held leadership roles in multiple tech companies, such as Meg Whitman, president and chief executive officer of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, and Marissa Mayer, president and CEO of Yahoo! from July 2012 to June 2017 and previously a long-time executive, usability leader, and key spokesperson at Google. Ada Lovelace was the first person to publish an algorithm intended to be executed by the first modern computer, the Analytical Engine created by Charles Babbage. Because of this, she is often regarded as the first computer programmer,    though this statement, as well as others about Ada's mathematical abilities and involvement with Babbage's project, has been criticized. During the 1800s, Edward Charles Pickering hired several women to work for him at Harvard. These women, called "Pickering's harem" at the time and also as the Harvard Computers, performed clerical work that the male employees and scholars considered to be tedious work at a fraction of the cost to hire a man.  Grace Hopper was the first person to create a compiler for a programming language and one of the first programmers of the Mark I computer, an electro-mechanical computer based on Analytical Engine. The regularly working programmers of the ENIAC computer in 1944, were six female mathematicians; Marlyn Meltzer, Betty Holberton, Kathleen Antonelli, Ruth Teitelbaum, Jean Bartik, and Frances Spence. Adele Goldstine was one of the teachers and trainers of the six original programmers of the ENIAC computer. Adele died of cancer in 1964 at the age of 44. Adele Goldberg was one of the seven programmers that developed Smalltalk in the 1970s, one of the first object-oriented programming languages, the base of the current graphic user interface, that has its roots in the 1968 The Mother of All Demos by Douglas Engelbart. Smalltalk was later used by Apple to launch Apple Lisa in 1983, the first personal computer with a GUI, and one year later its Macintosh. Windows 1.0, based on the same principles, was launched a few months later in 1985. The ACM A.M. Turing Award, sometimes referred to as the "Nobel Prize" of Computing, was named in honor of Alan Mathison Turing (1912â€“1954), a British mathematician and computer scientist. The Turing award has been won by 3 women between 1966 and 2015.
