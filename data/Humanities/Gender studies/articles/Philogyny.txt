Philogyny is fondness, love, or admiration towards women.   Its antonym is misogyny. Philogyny is not be confused with gynephilia, which is sexual attraction to women or femininity (and whose antonym is gynophobia). Cicero reports the word could be used in Greek philosophy to denote being overly fond of women, which was considered a disease along with misogyny.  Christian Groes-Green has argued that the conceptual content of philogyny must be developed as an alternative to the concept of misogyny. Criticizing R.W. Connell's theory of hegemonic masculinities he shows how philogynous masculinities play out among youth in Maputo, Mozambique.  Philogyny comes from philo- (loving) and Greek gynÄ“ (woman). The parallel Greek-based terms with respect to men (males) are philandry for "fondness towards men" and misandry for "hatred of men". Parallel terms for humanity generally are philanthropy and misanthropy.
