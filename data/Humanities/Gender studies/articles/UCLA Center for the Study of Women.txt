 UCLA Center for the Study of Women (CSW) is an organized unit at the University of California, Los Angeles and a member of the National Council for Research on Women. Founded in 1984, the center works to develop and disseminate faculty and graduate student research on gender, sexuality, and women's issues through conferences, grants, seminars, and publications.  Since its creation, CSW has sponsored hundreds of events and performances at UCLA and the surrounding Los Angeles area that pertain to gender, sexuality, and women's issues. CSW has hosted the academic journals Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society and Journal of Middle East Women's Studies. The Center for the Study of Women was approved as an organized research unit by the Regents of the University of California in 1984, becoming the first organized research unit in the University of California system dedicated to research on gender related issues.   The center works with UCLA's Women Studies Program to develop curriculum and promote feminist scholarship among UCLA students.
