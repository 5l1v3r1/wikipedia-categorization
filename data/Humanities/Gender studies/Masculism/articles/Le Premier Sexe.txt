Le Premier Sexe (The First Sex) is a pamphlet from the writer, journalist and essayist Ã‰ric Zemmour. In this book, the author analyses what he considers to be the feminisation of society, or rather its devirilisation. Based on several examples from different fields, the writer denounces the passage from a patriarchal and traditional society to a modern and feminised one. The writer also examines all economic and social consequences of this movement. The analysis also allows the writer to explains the foundation of the behaviour of the last newly immigrated.  Its title is a reference to the book The Second Sex by Simone de Beauvoir.
