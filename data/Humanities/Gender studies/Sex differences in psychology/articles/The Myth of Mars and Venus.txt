The Myth of Mars and Venus: Do Men and Women Really Speak Different Languages? is a 2008 book by Deborah Cameron, published by Oxford University Press.  The title refers to the central conceit of John Gray's 1992 book Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus, which Cameron's book is partially a response to. Cameron argues that "what linguistic differences there are between men and women are driven by the need to construct and project personal meaning and identity." She challenges "the idea that sex-differences might have biological rather than social causes" as being more motivated by a reaction to politically correct attitudes than being derived from basic research. The book argues that there is as much similarity and variation within each gender as between men and women. Cameron concludes that we have an urgent need to think about gender in more complex ways than the prevailing myths and stereotypes allow.
