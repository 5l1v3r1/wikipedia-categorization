There are many ways for you to contribute - small and large. If you have a question, post it on the task force's main talk page. Although there are no top women's leagues expressly included in WikiProject Hockey's notability guideline: WP:NHOCKEY, there is often enough media coverage about a player, team, or league that meets the WP:GNG guideline, which takes precedence over WP:NHOCKEY. For college athletes and coaches, see WP:NCOLLATH. For youth, see WP:YOUNGATH. For Olympians, see WP:NOLYMPICS. The key to ensuring that an article that you create is not deleted is providing adequate referencing to meet WP:GNG or WP:SPORTCRIT.  If you have any questions or run into any issues, feel free to post them on the this project's talk page.
