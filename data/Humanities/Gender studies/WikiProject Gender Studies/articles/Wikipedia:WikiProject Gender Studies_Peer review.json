This is to encourage better articles by having contributors who may not have worked on articles to examine them and provide ideas for further improvement. It is intended for high-quality articles that have already undergone extensive work, often as a way of preparing a <a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:FAC\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Wikipedia:FAC\">featured article candidate</a> - however, the process is highly flexible and can deal with articles of any quality though requesting reviews on very short articles may not be productive as there is little for readers to comment on. This process is not an academic peer review by a group of experts in a particular subject, and articles that undergo this process should not be assumed to have greater authority than any other.\n</p><p>Many articles which are supported by the Gender Studies Wikiproject are also within the scope of other WikiProjects, many of which have peer reviews departments are well.
