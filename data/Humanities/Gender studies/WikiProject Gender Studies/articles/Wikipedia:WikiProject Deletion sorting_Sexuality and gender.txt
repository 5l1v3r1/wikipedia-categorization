This is a collection of discussions on the deletion of articles related to Sexuality and gender.  It is one of many deletion lists coordinated by WikiProject Deletion sorting.  Anyone can help maintain the list on this page.     In addition to AfDs, this page also tracks Categories for discussion, Templates for deletion, Miscellany for deletion, and Deletion review, but these  discussions are not automatically expanded here. You will have to follow the links from here to the discussion pages. Instructions for adding these discussions to this page are provided in the comments when you press "edit". For important information about categorization:  An advertorially-toned page on an unremarkable adult website. Significant RS coverage not found; what comes up is passing mentions and / or WP:SPIP. Does not meet WP:NCORP / WP:WEB. Awards are not significant / well known. Created by Special:Contributions/Brycethomason with few other contributions outside this topic. K.e.coffman (talk) 00:38, 18 September 2018 (UTC) Procedural nomination (as nominator I'm neutral)  as per Wikipedia:Redirects_for_discussion/Log/2018_September_6#Nikki_and_Nora. The article itself was unilaterally converted into a redirect by an anon and was submitted by another to RfD. --Lenticel (talk) 01:19, 16 September 2018 (UTC) Pinging the following editors involved in the RfD: 74.89.42.17 (talk · contribs);  Thryduulf (talk · contribs);  AngusWOOF (talk · contribs)  --Lenticel (talk) 01:22, 16 September 2018 (UTC) Non-notable porn star recreated after AfD deletion.  Still fails WP:PORNBIO with only a scene-related award win.  Still fails WP:GNG/WP:BASIC without significant coverage by reliable secondary sources.  RS references are about the PornHub publicity stunt he participated in.  Other biographical sources are interviews and press releases. • Gene93k (talk) 13:57, 1 September 2018 (UTC)
