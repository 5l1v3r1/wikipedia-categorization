The Simone de Beauvoir Prize (French: Prix Simone de Beauvoir pour la liberté des femmes) is an international human rights prize for women's freedom, awarded since 2008 to individuals or groups fighting for gender equality and opposing breaches of human rights. It is named after the French author and philosopher Simone de Beauvoir, known for her 1949 women's rights treatise The Second Sex.  The prize was founded by Julia Kristeva on January 9, 2008, the 100th anniversary of de Beauvoir's birth. It amounts to €20,000 and is funded by Éditions Gallimard and Culturesfrance.  Julia Kristeva, philosopher, is the head of the Simone de Beauvoir prize committee.  According to the organizers: The prize is awarded every year to a remarkable personality whose courage and thoughts are examples for everybody, in the spirit of Simone de Beauvoir who wrote: "The ultimate end, for which human beings should aim, is liberty, the only capable [thing], to establish every end on."
