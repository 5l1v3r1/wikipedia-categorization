Violence diminishes women\u2019s and girls\u2019 ability to gain an education, earn a living and participate in public life, and live a life free of fear. It has significant health impacts, including psychological consequences, physical injuries, sexual/reproductive health issues and death.<sup class=\"reference plainlinks nourlexpansion\" id=\"ref_c\"><a class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EGM:_prevention_of_violence_against_women_and_girls#endnote_c\">[3]</a></sup> In war-affected settings, violence against women and girls inhibits efforts towards peace-building and sustainable recovery, contributing to the risk of resurgent conflict. In development settings, it hinders progress towards achievement of several of the <a href=\"/wiki/Millennium_Development_Goals\" title=\"Millennium Development Goals\">Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)</a>, including those relating to <a href=\"/wiki/Millennium_Development_Goals#Goal_2:_Achieve_universal_primary_education\" title=\"Millennium Development Goals\">education</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Millennium_Development_Goals#Goal_6:_Combat_HIV/AIDS,_malaria,_and_other_diseases\" title=\"Millennium Development Goals\">HIV/AIDS</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Millennium_Development_Goals#Goal_5:_Improve_maternal_health\" title=\"Millennium Development Goals\">maternal health</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Millennium_Development_Goals#Goal_4:_Reduce_child_mortality_rates\" title=\"Millennium Development Goals\">child mortality</a>.<sup class=\"reference plainlinks nourlexpansion\" id=\"ref_d\"><a class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EGM:_prevention_of_violence_against_women_and_girls#endnote_d\">[4]</a></sup> It has intergenerational impacts, given that women use disproportionately more of their income toward supporting their families, and because violence diminishes their ability to fully participate in their societies (for example in politics, work or education) they are less able to invest in their children\u2019s futures. One study in Chile found that women\u2019s lost earnings alone as a result of domestic violence cost US$1.56 billion or more than 2 percent of the country\u2019s Gross Domestic Product.<sup class=\"reference plainlinks nourlexpansion\" id=\"ref_e\"><a class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EGM:_prevention_of_violence_against_women_and_girls#endnote_e\">[5]</a></sup>\n</p><p><i>EGM note 10</i><br /> Violence against women and girls therefore entails massive costs to the State, and has a dragging effect on all other social and economic development efforts, particularly in humanitarian and development contexts. It is only by lowering the incidence of violence against women and girls, preventing recurrence, and responding effectively to existing violence to minimise ongoing impacts, that the overall costs of such violence to any economy will be reduced.<sup class=\"reference plainlinks nourlexpansion\" id=\"ref_f\"><a class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EGM:_prevention_of_violence_against_women_and_girls#endnote_f\">[6]</a></sup> Experts noted that, in the face of such evidence, prevention is not only possible, but central to the social and economic advancement of developed and developing countries alike. It was reiterated that all States have not only a responsibility to significantly strengthen their planning and budgeting efforts for prevention of violence against women and girls, but that doing so will contribute to positive social and economic outcomes.\n</p><p><i>EGM note 11</i><br /> Experts brought together experiences from across developing and developed countries, and from humanitarian contexts (arising from conflict and natural disasters), demonstrating that violence against women and girls could be prevented regardless of political, social and economic conditions. Levels of violence against women and girls vary across countries that with similar economic status or political systems \u2013 a variation that can be attributed to different laws, policies, practices, norms, behaviours and attitudes that contribute to, justify or excuse violence against women and girls. Such factors must be targeted to prevent and reduce violence within and across all settings.\n</p><p><i>EGM note 12</i><br /> Across developing and developed countries alike, more comprehensive, multi-sectoral and sustained approaches were recognised as necessary to achieve such change, with investments commensurate to the enormous scale of the abuse and its impacts. While the allocation of more resources to prevention remained high on the priority list for experts, political will was also identified as a key factor. It was noted that organisations and communities in some developing countries have led the way in testing and expanding new models for prevention, however experts did not believe any State was currently meeting its full normative obligations in this area.\n</p><p><i>EGM note 13</i><br /> Experts reiterated that violence against women and girls is a pervasive and systematic human rights violation, caused by \u2013 and reinforcing \u2013 gender inequality and entrenched discrimination. While most violence against women and girls is committed by non-State actors or individuals (usually men known to the victims/survivors, often husbands/intimate partners or other family members), experts were adamant that laws, policies and practices emanating from the State \u2013 as well as from traditional or customary practices \u2013 could also result in direct violence against women and girls, fail to respond to it, or create an environment where such violence was tolerated, excused or justified.\n</p><p><i>EGM note 14</i><br /> To this end, experts noted that the prevention of violence against women and girls could not be achieved without the full implementation of the existing legal obligation on States \u2013 under the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Convention_on_the_Elimination_of_All_Forms_of_Discrimination_against_Women\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women\">Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW)</a></i> to \u2018take all appropriate measures to modify the social and cultural patterns of conduct of men and women, with a view to achieving the elimination of prejudices and customary and all other practices which are based on the idea of the inferiority or the superiority of either of the sexes or on stereotyped roles for men and women,\u2019<sup class=\"reference plainlinks nourlexpansion\" id=\"ref_g\"><a class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EGM:_prevention_of_violence_against_women_and_girls#endnote_g\">[7]</a></sup> along with the more detailed obligations relating to the elimination of violence against women and girls outlined in the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Fourth_World_Conference_on_Women#Beijing_Platform_for_Action\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Fourth World Conference on Women\">Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action (BPfA)</a></i>.<sup class=\"reference plainlinks nourlexpansion\" id=\"ref_h\"><a class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EGM:_prevention_of_violence_against_women_and_girls#endnote_h\">[8]</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-Source2_3-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Source2-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> Experts emphasised, as central to the latter, the obligation on States to \u2018refrain from invoking any custom, tradition or religious consideration to avoid their obligations\u2019<sup class=\"reference plainlinks nourlexpansion\" id=\"ref_i\"><a class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EGM:_prevention_of_violence_against_women_and_girls#endnote_i\">[9]</a></sup> to eliminate violence against women and girls.\n</p><p><i>EGM note 15</i><br /> A key message from experts was that the call for greater efforts to prevent violence against women and girls is not a \u2018new demand,\u2019 but well supported by international legal and normative frameworks. What is new is the emergence, in recent years, of an unprecedented evidence and practice base that provides concrete guidance on the application of proven and effective strategies, and makes prevention of violence against women and girls a tangible and measurable goal. We now know that to effectively prevent violence against women and girls, efforts must go beyond simple awareness-raising projects and instead work to actively (and measurably) transform discriminatory and violence-supportive attitudes and behaviours, community norms, institutional practices and systems, laws and policies, and society as a whole.\n</p><p><i>EGM note 16</i><br /> Experts noted that this holistic and comprehensive approach to prevention has the potential to create numerous benefits for communities beyond reductions in violence, because it also addresses the discrimination, inequality and other violence-supportive practices and behaviours that contribute to a range of social ills. Prevention of violence against women and girls is ultimately about building relationships, communities and organisations that are equal, non-violent and respectful of all individuals. It results in the creation of more peaceful, egalitarian and productive societies where women and girls live free from the discrimination, harassment, violence and fear of violence that can block them from reaching their full human potential.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Defining_prevention\">Defining prevention</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=EGM:_prevention_of_violence_against_women_and_girls&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Defining prevention\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><i>EGM note 17</i><br /> The focus of the meeting (and this report) was on prevention of violence against women and girls <i>before it occurs</i>, that is, by identifying and addressing its underlying causes and promoting shifts in the social environment that ultimately reduce the number of new incidents of violence against women and girls.\n</p><p><i>EGM note 18</i><br /> Experts noted that prevention of violence against women and girls remains a poorly understood concept across sectors and stakeholders. Prevention is often conflated with early intervention or the response to existing violence, or else limited to awareness raising or social marketing campaigns. Simplistic analyses and programmes aimed at single-cause factors such as alcohol abuse, or placing the responsibility to prevent violence on women and girls themselves (such as self-defence programmes) can in some cases do more harm than good, and are not uncommon. Cynical perceptions that violence against women and girls is somehow an inevitable part of society, and that efforts to prevent it are well-intentioned but ultimately ineffective, are also widespread. There is therefore a need to build not only evidence, but shared understandings of the complexity and causes of violence against women and girls, and of how it can be effectively prevented.\n</p><p><i>EGM note 19</i><br /> Experts recognised that this transformative agenda engages all levels of the socio-political system, from policy and legislative development, to the development and delivery of programmes and services \u2018on the ground\u2019, and the capacity building of the institutions responsible for implementation. Confronting existing social and gendered realities that continue to use arguments based on culture, customs and \u2018traditional\u2019 values and practices to justify discrimination and violence against women and girls, and treat them as subordinate and second-class citizens, remains a major challenge in addressing the social and cultural environments that permit violence against women and girls to flourish with impunity. As the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences has noted: \u2018no form of interpersonal violence against women is devoid of structural violence \u2013 as in all places, such abuse is underpinned by beliefs about the perpetrator\u2019s right to harm another, based on societal notions of gender and rights.\u2019<sup class=\"reference plainlinks nourlexpansion\" id=\"ref_j\"><a class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EGM:_prevention_of_violence_against_women_and_girls#endnote_j\">[10]</a></sup>\n</p><p><i>EGM note 20</i><br /> Experts were particularly keen to convey that, in prevention terms, violence against women and girls in the private sphere and/or perpetrated by non-State actors could <i>not</i> be considered as something \u2018separate\u2019 from the actions of the State. Experts stressed that violence against women and girls \u2013 in every context \u2013 can be perpetuated by State decision-making mechanisms, laws, policies and practices when these systematically marginalize women and girls and/or fail to promote their rights. These include not only legal policies and programs that fail to criminalize violence against women and girls or adequately punish it, but also State-sanctioned discrimination, for example: excluding women from political participation (such as assemblies, high-level government positions, and key decision-making bodies like constitutional committees); constitutional language that threatens women\u2019s rights (whether existing or developing in emerging State structures); or discriminatory laws, policies and budgets which disproportionately limit women\u2019s and girls\u2019 rights, neglect their voices and concerns, and fail to promote full substantive, as well as formal, equality between men and women.\n</p><p><i>EGM note 21</i><br /> State-sanctioned violence and discrimination against women is significantly tied to cultural and social norms that pervade a nation, which are then used to justify, excuse or tolerate violence against women and girls. When laws and policies limit women\u2019s freedoms or deem women as \u2018complementary\u2019 instead of \u2018equal to\u2019 men, this trickles down to public perception of women and girls and their role in society, and undermines their safety and security within the State. These social and cultural norms are similarly impacted by the respect, or otherwise, of women\u2019s civil and political rights (such as their political participation), and their economic, social and cultural rights (such as their access to work and education). Greater levels of social and economic equality between men and women, for instance, are closely correlated with lower levels of violence against women and girls at the population level. Similarly, greater visibility of women in leadership roles, including in constitution committees, assemblies and high-level posts in government, in peacekeeping troops and in peace-building talks, promotes positive and egalitarian norms and combats gender stereotypes in a way that counters discriminatory and violence-supportive attitudes and the marginalization of women and girls.\n</p><p><i>EGM note 22</i><br /> Prevention of violence against women and girls is often conceptualised in terms of awareness raising or community mobilisation, and these are important components. Experts reiterated the importance of grassroots community mobilisation in driving attitudinal and behavioural transformation at the local level. However, in light of the above, experts stressed the more expansive and multi-level nature of effective prevention, in particular the critical role of government to create an \u2018enabling environment\u2019 through undertaking policy, legislative and budgetary reform to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment, and actively address the multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and disadvantage that place women and girls at risk of violence. They emphasised the additional role of States in providing support to women\u2019s and other civil society actors, including women, men and youth community and religious leaders and opinion-makers, in their prevention efforts.\n</p><p><i>EGM note 23</i><br /> Experts further stressed the importance of continued investment in an effective <i>response</i> to existing violence against women and girls \u2013 including through improving legislative, police, justice and service systems<sup class=\"reference plainlinks nourlexpansion\" id=\"ref_k\"><a class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EGM:_prevention_of_violence_against_women_and_girls#endnote_k\">[11]</a></sup> \u2013 as a fundamental \u2018building block\u2019 for prevention, establishing accountability and redress, and protecting women and girls from further violence. Effective response systems are also necessary to ensure support of women and girls who may identify violence in their own lives as a direct result of prevention activity and seek help and redress. Experts acknowledged that a separate stream of work on building an effective multi-sectoral response was being undertaken in preparation for CSW.\n</p><p><i>EGM note 24</i><br /> Experts recommended that prevention and response strategies be developed and implemented as a holistic and integrated system that upholds the human rights of girls and women to live in societies, communities and families that are free of such violence. However, while essential, experts noted the evidence that an effective response has, in itself, only a limited impact on reducing the number of new incidents of violence. Specific actions to address the foundations of violence \u2013 discriminatory and violence-supportive practices, laws, norms, behaviours and attitudes \u2013 are also necessary in order to prevent violence against women and girls from happening in the first place, within and across all settings. These are the focus of discussions and recommendations in this Report.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Describing_the_context\">Describing the context</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=EGM:_prevention_of_violence_against_women_and_girls&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Describing the context\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><i>EGM note 25</i><br /> The emphasis on economic growth in the development agenda globally has led to growing inequalities and a reduced focus on redistribution. The rolling economic crises currently gripping almost all of the world\u2019s countries has resulted in increased unemployment and poverty, a shortage of housing, and cutbacks in social spending including subsidies for health and education. These multiple crises have in turn fuelled communal and ethnic tensions, mass migration and displacement, rendering millions homeless and poor, and more vulnerable to trafficking and diverse forms of exploitation. In most communities, this also results in the heightened vulnerability of women and girls to violence and exploitation.\n</p><p><i>EGM note 26</i><br /> Experts noted the evidence that violence against women and girls is intensified and exacerbated in situations of socio-economic stress, conflict and other crisis situations. In addition to the impact of economic crises described above, global warming and associated rising sea levels and severe weather events, as well as environmental degradation and resource depletion, can all contribute to conditions of social and economic vulnerability, including homelessness and mass migrations. They can also lead to the disaster or crisis situations in which violence against women and girls is known to increase.\n</p><p><i>EGM note 27</i><br /> As discrimination based on sex and gender continues to dominate social formations even in the 21st century, experts noted that violence against women and girls continues to be perceived as \u2018normal\u2019 in many contexts. The pervasive nature of militarization and the growth of all forms of religious fundamentalisms and other forms of extreme nationalism creates cultures where women are reduced to being symbolic \u2018bearers\u2019 of their culture and have their mobility and autonomy restricted in many different ways.\n</p><p><i>EGM note 28</i><br /> Exacerbated by the conditions described above (and even without them) women and girls experience daily harassment, abuse, discrimination and violence across the numerous settings in which they conduct their lives, from workplaces, schools and other educational institutions, community and faith organisations and groups, market places, shops, on public transport, in social settings, online and via social media, during flight and while displaced as a result of conflict and natural disasters, and above all in their homes.\n</p><p><i>EGM note 29</i><br /> Experts also identified emerging contexts and issues that have an impact on violence against women and girls. For example, experts agreed that the role of new media presents a number of layered and complex challenges, as well as opportunities, for the prevention of violence against women and girls. In the first instance, new media is often a platform for the perpetuation of harmful masculinities and the objectification of women and girls. This can take a number of forms from everyday hyper-sexualised, one-dimensional images of women and girls to hard-core pornography which has moved from the peripheries to the mainstream of the pornography industry. Virtual spaces are also utilised to perpetuate direct attacks on women and girls. This can range from cyber-stalking to the posting of inappropriate images / videos of women. For example, women have increasingly reported incidents of footage of them engaged in sexual activity (filmed both with and without consent) being posted on internet sites without their consent. In a number of cases this has included the posting of footage of actual rapes.<sup class=\"reference plainlinks nourlexpansion\" id=\"ref_l\"><a class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EGM:_prevention_of_violence_against_women_and_girls#endnote_l\">[12]</a></sup>\n</p><p><i>EGM note 30</i><br /> Violence in the virtual space and the wider issues of how women and girls are objectified in the media has particular implications for girls and younger women, who are much more like to engage with social networking sites, instant messaging, etc. Despite the range of violations, incidents can be hard to prosecute, especially as the internet is not limited to nation spaces. There are also real challenges around balancing the right to freedom of expression with the right to be protected from discrimination.<sup class=\"reference plainlinks nourlexpansion\" id=\"ref_m\"><a class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EGM:_prevention_of_violence_against_women_and_girls#endnote_m\">[13]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Getting_out_of_gangs_(8517217065).jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Getting_out_of_gangs_%288517217065%29.jpg/220px-Getting_out_of_gangs_%288517217065%29.jpg\" width=\"220\" height=\"147\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Getting_out_of_gangs_%288517217065%29.jpg/330px-Getting_out_of_gangs_%288517217065%29.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Getting_out_of_gangs_%288517217065%29.jpg/440px-Getting_out_of_gangs_%288517217065%29.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"640\" data-file-height=\"427\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Getting_out_of_gangs_(8517217065).jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div><i>Day Walker</i> was <a href=\"/wiki/Gangmembers\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Gangmembers\">Welcome</a>\u2019s nickname in the gang and crowns represent a leadership position.<br />\"Welcome\" transformed his life to become a women\u2019s rights champion after taking part in a UK aid supported prisons project with <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Sonke_Gender_Justice&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Sonke Gender Justice (page does not exist)\">Sonke Gender Justice</a>.

They may also be members of gangs themselves and involved in perpetration of violence against other young women and girls within or between gangs. Experts further expressed the concern that adolescent girls and young women were frequently overlooked in policy and programming responses designed for young men, adult women or for children in general, yet the context of their lives may be quite distinct and require specific approaches, particularly given they are the age group at greatest risk of sexual violence.<sup class=\"reference plainlinks nourlexpansion\" id=\"ref_n\"><a class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EGM:_prevention_of_violence_against_women_and_girls#endnote_n\">[14]</a></sup>\n</p><p><i>EGM note 32</i><br /> In humanitarian crises caused by conflict and/or natural disasters, women and girls are at risk of violence throughout all stages: during crises, during flight from crises, while living in displaced settings, and during and following return. In situations of armed conflict, women and girls can be exposed to violence at the hands of armed actors, including soldiers and military assigned to protect civilians and assist in their safe flight from conflict. They may be recruited into armed groups and serve as sexual slaves to combatants. In some settings women and girls continue to be used as \u2018weapons of war,\u2019 subject to sexual assault by all parties to conflict, at times in front of their husbands, children, and other family or community members.\n</p><p><i>EGM note 33</i><br /> While much attention has been accorded to sexual violence against women and girls during conflict, they suffer many additional forms of violence in humanitarian emergencies, including sexual exploitation, trafficking, early marriage, and <a href=\"/wiki/Intimate_partner_violence\" title=\"Intimate partner violence\">intimate partner violence</a>.<sup class=\"reference plainlinks nourlexpansion\" id=\"ref_o\"><a class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EGM:_prevention_of_violence_against_women_and_girls#endnote_o\">[15]</a></sup> Experts noted that all of these forms of violence can be averted or reduced with effective prevention programming from the contingency planning phase through to recovery, and States\u2019 responsibilities to work towards the prevention of this violence are reinforced by a broad normative framework mandating protection of women and girls from sexual and other forms of violence in emergencies. And yet, prevention programming remains weak in virtually every humanitarian setting around the world.\n</p><p><i>EGM note 34</i><br /> Experts further noted the evidence that while more than 740,000 men, women, and children die each year as a result of armed violence, the majority of these deaths \u2013 490,000 \u2013 occur in countries that are not affected by conflict.<sup class=\"reference plainlinks nourlexpansion\" id=\"ref_p\"><a class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EGM:_prevention_of_violence_against_women_and_girls#endnote_p\">[16]</a></sup> The proliferation of small arms increases the vulnerability of women and girls to violence, and exacerbates the seriousness of that violence. This is particularly true in the context of urban/serious youth (e.g. gang) violence (referred to above), but also in the case of violence in the home, where the presence of small arms significantly increases the risk of the victim being killed.<sup class=\"reference plainlinks nourlexpansion\" id=\"ref_q\"><a class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EGM:_prevention_of_violence_against_women_and_girls#endnote_q\">[17]</a></sup> The violent deaths of approximately 66,000 women and girls are attributed to armed violence globally each year.<sup class=\"reference plainlinks nourlexpansion\" id=\"ref_r\"><a class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EGM:_prevention_of_violence_against_women_and_girls#endnote_r\">[18]</a></sup>\n</p><p><i>EGM note 35</i><br /> Experts were finally keen to emphasise that \u2013 even within the same geographic or socio-political setting, \u2018context\u2019 was not the same thing for different women and girls. Women and girls often experience multiple and intersecting forms of social disadvantage and discrimination (in addition to that based on gender), and this compounds their individual and collective vulnerability to violence. The Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, has recently noted that theories on violence have often \u2018failed to provide a comprehensive understanding of how various forms of discrimination, beyond a male/female gender binary, contextualize, exacerbate, and correlate to high levels of violence in given societies. The lack of an intersectional approach can lead to the reinforcing of one form of discrimination in attempts to alleviate another.\u2019<sup class=\"reference plainlinks nourlexpansion\" id=\"ref_s\"><a class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EGM:_prevention_of_violence_against_women_and_girls#endnote_s\">[19]</a></sup> Factors such as race, ethnicity, caste, class, age, religion, sexual orientation, marital status, geographic location, disability, HIV status or status as a refugee or internally displaced person, will all influence the forms and nature of violence women and girls may suffer, and the relationship of these factors to prevention is discussed in the \u2018Key Findings\u2019 section.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Global_policy_and_legislative_.2F_normative_framework_.28abridged.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Global_policy_and_legislative_/_normative_framework_(abridged)\">Global policy and legislative / normative framework (abridged)</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=EGM:_prevention_of_violence_against_women_and_girls&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Global policy and legislative / normative framework (abridged)\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><i>EGM note 36</i><br /> The international community is committed to eliminating violence against women and girls<sup class=\"reference plainlinks nourlexpansion\" id=\"ref_t\"><a class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EGM:_prevention_of_violence_against_women_and_girls#endnote_t\">[20]</a></sup> and has recognised \u2013 in various global and regional legal and policy instruments \u2013 the important role of prevention towards this end.\n</p><p><i>EGM note 37</i><br /> Above all, State responsibility for prevention of violence against women and girls through social and behavioural change is supported by the foundational treaty on women\u2019s human rights, the <i>Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women</i> (CEDAW), which establishes signatories\u2019 legal obligation to take \u2018all appropriate measures [to] modify the social and cultural patterns of conduct of men and women, with a view to achieving the elimination of prejudices and customary and all other practices which are based on the idea of the inferiority or the superiority of either of the sexes or on stereotyped roles for men and women.\u2019<sup class=\"reference plainlinks nourlexpansion\" id=\"ref_u\"><a class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EGM:_prevention_of_violence_against_women_and_girls#endnote_u\">[21]</a></sup>  General Recommendation 19 of the CEDAW Committee defines violence as a form of discrimination against women, and establishes the obligation of States to act with \u2018due diligence\u2019 to prevent and respond to violence against women and girls.\n</p><p><i>EGM note 38</i><br /> The <i>Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women</i> enhanced the definition of violence against women and also included protection of women from violence committed in the private domain as being an obligation of the state.<sup class=\"reference plainlinks nourlexpansion\" id=\"ref_v\"><a class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EGM:_prevention_of_violence_against_women_and_girls#endnote_v\">[22]</a></sup> Responsibilities of the State to prevent violence, abuse and neglect of girls are further supported by the <i>Convention on the Rights of the Child</i>, requiring States parties to \u2018take all appropriate legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to protect the child from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation, including sexual abuse\u2019 including \u2018forms of prevention,\u2019<sup class=\"reference plainlinks nourlexpansion\" id=\"ref_w\"><a class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EGM:_prevention_of_violence_against_women_and_girls#endnote_w\">[23]</a></sup> along with its two Optional Protocols.<sup class=\"reference plainlinks nourlexpansion\" id=\"ref_x\"><a class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EGM:_prevention_of_violence_against_women_and_girls#endnote_x\">[24]</a></sup>\n</p><p><i>EGM note 39</i><br /> The <i>Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action</i> (BPfA), adopted at the Fourth World Conference on Women in 1995, recognised the complexity of the underlying causes of violence against women and girls, and the need to link prevention and response activities. Paragraph 118 notes that:<br />\n</p>\n<dl><dd><i>violence against women throughout the life cycle derives essentially from cultural patterns, in particular the harmful effects of certain traditional or customary practices and all acts of extremism linked to race, sex, language or religion that perpetuate the lower status accorded to women in the family, the workplace, the community and society. Violence against women is exacerbated by social pressures, notably the shame of denouncing certain acts that have been perpetrated against women; women's lack of access to legal information, aid or protection; the lack of laws that effectively prohibit violence against women; failure to reform existing laws; inadequate efforts on the part of public authorities to promote awareness of and enforce existing laws; and the absence of educational and other means to address the causes and consequences of violence. Images in the media of violence against women, in particular those that depict rape or sexual slavery as well as the use of women and girls as sex objects, including pornography, are factors contributing to the continued prevalence of such violence, adversely influencing the community at large, in particular children and young people.</i><sup class=\"reference plainlinks nourlexpansion\" id=\"ref_y\"><a class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EGM:_prevention_of_violence_against_women_and_girls#endnote_y\">[25]</a></sup></dd></dl>\n<p><i>EGM notes 40 to 51</i><br /> Other global policy and legislative / normative frameworks that are currently in place.\n</p><p><i>EGM note 52</i><br /> In conclusion, while the normative framework has clearly developed an obligation for States to take holistic, comprehensive, strategic and well-resourced action to prevent violence against women and girls, and while States have increasingly ratified the relevant treaties and in some cases brought these obligations into their legal frameworks, much work remains to be done before the normative obligations will be fully implemented. Gaps remain in terms of resource allocation, legislative and policy development, and systems and mechanisms for coordinated and sustained action.\n</p><p><i>EGM note 53</i><br /> In considering the above analysis, experts believed that a significant global shift in perceptions was necessary towards greater recognition of the widespread and systematic nature of violence against women and girls, deserving of more serious attention by States and the international community. Experts returned to and supported the international definition of violence against women and girls in the <i>Declaration</i>, i.e. as a violation of human rights and a form of discrimination against them, that shall mean all acts of gender-based violence that result in, or are likely to result in, physical, sexual, psychological or economic harm or suffering to women and girls, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life.<sup class=\"reference plainlinks nourlexpansion\" id=\"ref_z\"><a class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EGM:_prevention_of_violence_against_women_and_girls#endnote_z\">[26]</a></sup>\n</p><p><i>EGM note 54</i><br /> However, some experts noted that such violence is not isolated or sporadic, but could be seen as part of a widespread or systematic practice intended to humiliate or degrade an identifiable group. As such, they called for violence against women and girls to be considered a crime against humanity. Others cautioned against linking violence against women and girls to current definitions of crimes against humanity, given the existing limitations of international law and jurisprudence. It was noted that the landmark February 2008 judgement of the Sierra Leone Appeals Chamber of the Special Court in the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council case had set an historic precedent in recognising forced marriage as a distinct category of crimes against humanity in international criminal law.<sup class=\"reference plainlinks nourlexpansion\" id=\"ref_A\"><a class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EGM:_prevention_of_violence_against_women_and_girls#endnote_A\">[27]</a></sup> Experts therefore agreed that calling for violence against women and girls to be recognised as a crime against humanity was intended as an aspirational statement and advocacy goal, one which would expand current definitions and understanding of crimes against humanity \u2013 in a way similar to the Sierra Leone case \u2013 and help drive a global shift in perceptions towards one that recognises the full seriousness of violence against women and girls, and the urgency with which we must prevent it.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Key_findings_.28abridged.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Key_findings_(abridged)\">Key findings (abridged)</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=EGM:_prevention_of_violence_against_women_and_girls&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Key findings (abridged)\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><i>EGM note 55</i><br /> Based on comprehensive discussion at the EGM, review of the papers presented by experts, and an analysis of the global context, normative framework and evidence and practice base, experts agreed on the following key findings. Experts noted the significant development, over recent years, of guidance to States and other stakeholders in the development, implementation and monitoring of policy and programming to prevent violence against women and girls,<sup class=\"reference plainlinks nourlexpansion\" id=\"ref_B\"><a class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EGM:_prevention_of_violence_against_women_and_girls#endnote_B\">[28]</a></sup> and again\nreferred to the papers submitted to the EGM as providing further information on current practice. Rather than reiterate that guidance here, experts have confined their findings below to the emerging issues, and those perceived to be of most critical relevance to CSW.\n</p><p><i>EGM note 56</i><br /> Experts wished to reiterate, as a finding and central tenet of their recommendations, that prevention of violence against women and girls is a positive endeavour, a precondition for enabling women and men to reach their full potential, and is essential to the creation of healthy, equitable, stable and productive communities, workplaces, schools and universities, faith and cultural institutions, sporting and recreation organisations, and societies as a whole.\n</p><p><i>EGM note 57</i><br /> Noting recent research highlighting the unique and catalysing impact of women\u2019s organisations on enduring and effective policy development to end violence against women and girls,<sup class=\"reference plainlinks nourlexpansion\" id=\"ref_C\"><a class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EGM:_prevention_of_violence_against_women_and_girls#endnote_C\">[29]</a></sup> experts were unanimous that effective prevention of violence against women and girls was not only often driven by, but <i>required</i> the involvement of women\u2019s organisations, working in partnership with national, provincial and local Governments, communities, civil society groups, donors, the private sector and other non-state actors.\n</p><p><i>EGM note 58</i><br /> Experts emphasized the importance of moving away from short-term, ad hoc sensitisation and awareness raising activities and towards more comprehensive, longer-term prevention efforts that are grounded in communities and work systematically to change unequal power relations between women and men. Such social norm change requires working with a cross section of the community from women and men, young people, religious and cultural leaders, health care providers, police, government officials, the media and others, over time and in varied ways, to challenge norms that perpetuate violence and emphasize the positive benefits of non-violence, justice and equality for individuals, families and the broader community. Civil society plays an essential role in mobilising communities to rethink the acceptability of violence and supporting positive change.\n</p><p><i>EGM note 59</i><br /> However, while women\u2019s and other civil society organisations and communities themselves have been at the forefront of developing the practice and evidence base for prevention programming, factors such as time, reach and workforce constraints can prevent many good initiatives from being evaluated, expanded or otherwise scaled-up. Research has also shown that those working to end violence against women and girls can themselves face discrimination, hostility, repudiation and even violence, precisely because they challenge traditional notions of the family and gender that contribute to such violence.<sup class=\"reference plainlinks nourlexpansion\" id=\"ref_D\"><a class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EGM:_prevention_of_violence_against_women_and_girls#endnote_D\">[30]</a></sup>\n</p><p><i>EGM note 60</i><br />\nTo maximise the impact and sustainability of such work, therefore, Governments have a key role to play in supporting and creating an enabling environment for women\u2019s organisations and others working to prevent violence against women and girls to continue to drive and innovate prevention programming, safe from violence and discrimination themselves. Governments should also activate their reach and mandate to ensure the scale-up, systematisation and embedding of good practice in laws, policies and through public institutions (e.g. schools, social and health services, media and workplace regulation) for long-term sustainability.\n</p><p><i>EGM note 61</i><br /> Experts noted that without States taking their full responsibility for sustained, systematic and coordinated policy, programming and investment for prevention, the transformative social development necessary to end violence against women and girls cannot be achieved. Few States worldwide had implemented their obligations to this end. A 2011 review of National Action Plans on Violence against Women found that most policies were limited to responding to existing violence. Those that did contain specific prevention actions largely focussed on raising awareness of new laws or where to access services, with some containing one-off or single-sector prevention activities such as social marketing campaigns or schools-based programmes. Only one identified plan took a long-term, multi-sectoral and holistic approach to prevention, with appropriate institutional support mechanisms and commensurate investment.<sup class=\"reference plainlinks nourlexpansion\" id=\"ref_E\"><a class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EGM:_prevention_of_violence_against_women_and_girls#endnote_E\">[31]</a></sup>\n</p><p><i>EGM note 62</i><br /> Importantly, one-off, single-sector or small-scale interventions, while they may have some effectiveness for participating individuals, are unable to change the social norms at the community or society level that have a dampening effect on such attitudinal change. Therefore, they can never in themselves decrease prevalence of violence against women and girls across society as a whole. Broad and sustainable change is only achieved when such activities are implemented in a long-term and cumulative way, mutually reinforced across various settings. These should be linked to a prevention framework which is coordinated to ensure that all levels are appropriately engaged, with evaluation and monitoring for continuous improvement. It is particularly essential that all strategies and interventions are supported by policy and legislative reform that promotes gender equality, challenges discrimination, and provides an effective response to existing violence.\n</p><p><i>EGM notes 63 to 102</i><br /> Other key findings from the EGM.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Report_recommendations\">Report recommendations</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=EGM:_prevention_of_violence_against_women_and_girls&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Report recommendations\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><i>Recommendation 103</i><br />\nExperts stressed the critical importance of women\u2019s organisations, civil society, international institutions, donors and States working together to go beyond \u2018ad hoc\u2019 approaches to prevention, and for States to take their responsibility for developing long-term and multi-sectoral strategies so that activity can be coordinated, and evidence built, to achieve real results. With an increased commitment from all actors to such an approach, and corresponding investment, many experts believed violence against women and girls could be ended within a generation. To this end, experts have made recommendations (see below) for a coordinated and target-focussed approach to preventing violence against women and girls, driven by two overarching activities \u2013 a <a href=\"/wiki/Global_Implementation_Plan_to_End_Violence_against_Women_and_Girls\" title=\"Global Implementation Plan to End Violence against Women and Girls\">Global Implementation Plan</a> \u2013 framing the work of international, regional and national institutions (including States) toward the goal of ending violence against women and girls, along with a  <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Global_Advocacy_Campaign_to_Prevent_Violence_against_Women_and_Girls&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Global Advocacy Campaign to Prevent Violence against Women and Girls (page does not exist)\">Global Advocacy Campaign</a> \u2013 driven by women\u2019s and other civil society organisations to create momentum and provide accountability for the above.\n</p><p><i>Recommendation 104</i><br /> Also, given CSW\u2019s specific mandate with regards to implementation of the <i>Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action</i><sup class=\"reference plainlinks nourlexpansion\" id=\"ref_F\"><a class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EGM:_prevention_of_violence_against_women_and_girls#endnote_F\">[32]</a></sup> experts have made further recommendations for immediate implementation, aligned with the BPfA\u2019s strategic objectives of taking integrated measures to prevent and eliminate violence against women, and studying the causes and consequences of violence against women and the effectiveness of preventive measures. While the BPfA objectives cover both prevention of, and response to, violence against women and girls, and experts supported full implementation of all of these, the recommendations below build on those areas focussing on prevention.\n</p><p><i>Recommendation 105</i><br /> Finally, experts identified recommendations arising from emerging issues or gaps in the evidence and practice base regarding prevention of violence against women and girls in certain contexts and settings. These include recommendations for prevention in settings affected by humanitarian crises such as conflict and natural disasters; contexts of serious urban or youth violence; with regards to representation of women and girls in the context of mass media as well as in new social media; and in the context of the global financial crisis and shifting geopolitics. In addition to the broad recommendations below that are relevant to all settings, special attention has been given to certain contexts and settings in order to highlight specific strategies for prevention related to these particular areas of concern. Experts have also chosen to highlight certain recommendations specific to preventing violence against girls, including adolescent girls, and young women, as a frequently overlooked group worthy of special consideration.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"A_global_implementation_plan_to_end_violence_against_women_and_girls\">A global implementation plan to end violence against women and girls</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=EGM:_prevention_of_violence_against_women_and_girls&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: A global implementation plan to end violence against women and girls\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Earth-illustration-blue.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Earth-illustration-blue.jpg/220px-Earth-illustration-blue.jpg\" width=\"220\" height=\"220\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Earth-illustration-blue.jpg/330px-Earth-illustration-blue.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/Earth-illustration-blue.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"433\" data-file-height=\"433\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Earth-illustration-blue.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div><i><a href=\"/wiki/Global_Implementation_Plan_to_End_Violence_against_Women_and_Girls\" title=\"Global Implementation Plan to End Violence against Women and Girls\">A global implementation plan to end violence against women and girls.</a></i>(Recommendations 106 -112)</div></div></div>\n<p><i>Recommendation 106</i><br />\nExperts agreed that while an international legal and normative frame work for preventing violence against women and girls is already in place, there are two major barriers to its implementation. The first is that social and cultural norms and customs are often used as a shroud or excuse for laws, practices and behaviours that are either directly violent and discriminatory towards women and girls, or else contribute to and support violence against them. <b>The BPfA clearly calls on States to \u2018refrain from invoking any custom, tradition or religious consideration to avoid their obligations with respect to its elimination as set out in the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women,\u2019</b><sup class=\"reference plainlinks nourlexpansion\" id=\"ref_G\"><a class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EGM:_prevention_of_violence_against_women_and_girls#endnote_G\">[33]</a></sup> and experts were adamant that this entails an active obligation on States to examine their own laws and policies, and challenge the communities, organisations and individuals in their jurisdictions, to eliminate norms and customs that excuse, justify or tolerate violence against women and girls, and which exist in all societies.\n</p><p><i>Recommendation 107</i><br />\nA second barrier to full implementation of existing obligations is the lack of a coordinated, strategic agenda at international, regional and national levels for <b>modifying \u2018the social and cultural patterns of conduct of men and women, with a view to achieving the elimination of prejudices and customary and all other practices which are based on the idea of the inferiority or the superiority of either of the sexes or on stereotyped roles for men and women,\u2019</b><sup class=\"reference plainlinks nourlexpansion\" id=\"ref_H\"><a class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EGM:_prevention_of_violence_against_women_and_girls#endnote_H\">[34]</a></sup> <b>required by <a href=\"/wiki/CEDAW\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"CEDAW\">CEDAW</a>.</b> This is an essential precondition and support for the sustainable prevention of violence against women and girls.

A much greater commitment and level of resourcing is required from all States, along with significantly improved coordination of policy, programming and research at global, regional and national levels towards a shared strategic agenda to eliminate these and so meet the legal obligation under CEDAW.\n</p><p><i>Recommendation 108</i><br />\nTo this end, an overarching recommendation from experts was that Member States commit, at CSW in 2013, to develop a <a href=\"/wiki/Global_Implementation_Plan_to_End_Violence_against_Women_and_Girls\" title=\"Global Implementation Plan to End Violence against Women and Girls\">Global Implementation Plan to End Violence against Women and Girls</a>, to be launched in 2015, with a particular focus on prevention of violence against women and girls.

This review and reform process should ensure law and policy: aligns with and responds explicitly to State obligations under relevant human rights treaties, intergovernmental agreements and international standards/guidelines, repealing and reforming discriminatory laws and criminalizing violence against women and girls; defines violence against women and girls according to international norms, acknowledging that such violence is a form of discrimination and manifestation of historically unequal power relations between men and women, and the recognising the particular vulnerabilities of girls; and recognises that women\u2019s and girls\u2019 experience of violence is shaped by factors such as disability, age, ethnicity, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, marital status, sexual orientation, HIV/AIDS status, migrant or refugee status and exposure to conflict or natural disaster.</li>\n<li>be supported by multi-sectoral coordination mechanisms, with the involvement of representatives from across government institutions and also civil society, donors and other stakeholders who can aid in implementation. These mechanisms should begin by identifying where existing capacity could be harnessed in particular programmatic areas for immediate impact (e.g. through existing health or education sectors, or existing nongovernment programming), and provide for the development of capacity (e.g. a human rights training curriculum and mandatory training for all elected officials and civil servants at every level of government) across other sectors for mid to longer-term work.</li>\n<li>ensure earmarked budgets are in place in each relevant Ministry \u2013 including human and technical resources \u2013 to fund such strategies over the short, mid and long-terms. Working to integrate prevention of violence against women and girls into all leading policy and funding frameworks can also provide strategic avenues and a broad base from which to strengthen efforts and secure budgets. Examples of these include poverty reduction and development strategies and national plans, and sector-wide reforms related to education, health, security, justice, HIV and AIDS, peace-building, transitional justice, reconstruction and conflict prevention strategies and frameworks in post-conflict situations, and contingency planning strategies and frameworks in settings affected by cyclical natural disasters.</li>\n<li>set specific targets and include mechanisms for monitoring progress towards them, across implementing institutions, and agencies in international/regional systems. Institutional responsibilities and reporting arrangements against these targets should be articulated, and mechanisms for accountability established.

Similarly, engage with the International Telecommunications Union as it considers the issue of internet regulation at its December 2012 conference.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_global_financial_crisis_and_geo-politics\">The global financial crisis and geo-politics</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=EGM:_prevention_of_violence_against_women_and_girls&amp;action=edit&amp;section=14\" title=\"Edit section: The global financial crisis and geo-politics\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:TED_Spread.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/TED_Spread.png/220px-TED_Spread.png\" width=\"220\" height=\"138\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/TED_Spread.png/330px-TED_Spread.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/TED_Spread.png/440px-TED_Spread.png 2x\" data-file-width=\"800\" data-file-height=\"500\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:TED_Spread.png\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div><i>The global financial crisis and geo-politics.</i> (Recommendations 137 to 139)</div></div></div>\n<p><i>Recommendation 137</i><br />\nGiven the likely negative impact of the global financial crisis on levels of violence against women and girls, and the subsequent economic, health and social costs of such increased violence (in terms of reduced productivity, strains on services, etc.), experts recommend that States, international and regional institutions, civil society, the private sector and other stakeholders, should proactively and collaboratively work to protect women\u2019s and girls\u2019 right to live free of violence, in order to \u2018stem the tide\u2019 of negative economic, health and social impacts arising from such violence and their subsequent further costs to the State.\n</p><p><i>Recommendation 138</i><br />\nInternational and regional organisations, donors, development agencies, philanthropics and other non-governmental organisations should ensure that allocations of aid funding in the wake of the crisis support programmes\nto prevent (and respond to) violence against women and girls and promote women\u2019s human rights.\n</p><p><i>Recommendation 139</i><br />\nInternational and regional institutions, civil society organisations and established donors should engage emerging middle income countries and new donors in the development of the new <a href=\"/wiki/Global_Implementation_Plan_to_End_Violence_against_Women_and_Girls\" title=\"Global Implementation Plan to End Violence against Women and Girls\">Global Implementation Plan to End Violence against Women and Girls</a> and encourage a rights-based approach to aid investment that prioritises prevention of violence against women and girls through this international, target-focussed framework.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Urban.2C_serious_youth_.28e.g._gang.29_and_armed_violence\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Urban,_serious_youth_(e.g._gang)_and_armed_violence\">Urban, serious youth (e.g. gang) and armed violence</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=EGM:_prevention_of_violence_against_women_and_girls&amp;action=edit&amp;section=15\" title=\"Edit section: Urban, serious youth (e.g. gang) and armed violence\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Gun_outline.svg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Gun_outline.svg/220px-Gun_outline.svg.png\" width=\"220\" height=\"150\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Gun_outline.svg/330px-Gun_outline.svg.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Gun_outline.svg/440px-Gun_outline.svg.png 2x\" data-file-width=\"586\" data-file-height=\"400\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Gun_outline.svg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div><i>Urban, serious youth (e.g. gang) and armed violence.</i> (Recommendation 140)</div></div></div>\n<p><i>Recommendation 140</i><br />\nExperts recommend that States, non-governmental organisations, international/regional institutions and other stakeholders as appropriate:\n</p>\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Support investigations into the relationship between violence against women and girls and armed violence, especially thestrategies of gender-based violence used within and between rival armed groups and the use and threat of gender-based violence in the private sphere by members of armed groups, especially with guns.

(Recommendation 141)</div></div></div>\n<p><i>Recommendation 141</i><br />\nExperts noted the lack of documented prevention strategies for settings affected by conflict and/or natural disasters, and the consequent improvised, small-scale, and/or issue-specific nature of prevention activities in these settings. They emphasised that it is critical that States \u2013 and the humanitarian, peacekeeping, civil society and development actors with whom they engage \u2013 institute broad, well-coordinated measures to prevent violence against women and girls in all stages of humanitarian intervention, and ensure that those measures incorporate strategies that reach the most vulnerable, as well as monitoring and evaluation components in order to develop an evidence base for good practice. To this end, experts recommend that States and their humanitarian partners:\n</p>\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Integrate prevention into all contingency planning for humanitarian emergencies, and develop early warning systems to assess and avert the risk of violence against women and girls. Contingency planning and early warning strategies should engage women and girls in the affected communities in order to anticipate protection needs and develop, for example, community alert networks, safe spaces for women and girls, access to reproductive and sexual health care, widespread information about the illegality of violence against women and girls and the consequences for perpetrators. </li>\n<li>When a crisis strikes, immediately institute protections across all areas of humanitarian response, according to the IASC <i>Guidelines for Gender-based Violence Interventions in Humanitarian Settings</i>. Collect disaggregated data to identify the particular security needs of women and girls and develop targeted tools and guidelines to facilitate protection from and prevention of violence against women and girls, including protection from sexual exploitation and abuse committed by humanitarian actors against beneficiaries of humanitarian aid. Work with international and local human rights organisations to monitor the activities of armed groups to ensure that they adhere to the rules of combat, and are prohibited from, and held accountable for, violence against women and girls. All peacekeeping operations must act in accordance with the standards set forth in the UNSCRs on Women, Peace and Security.<sup class=\"reference plainlinks nourlexpansion\" id=\"ref_K\"><a class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EGM:_prevention_of_violence_against_women_and_girls#endnote_K\">[36]</a></sup></li>\n<li>After the initial emergency has passed and when working towards reconstruction, collaborate to expand prevention efforts and facilitate durable solutions for lasting peace and security. This includes incorporating prevention of violence against women and girls as an integral component of post-conflict and post-disaster action plans, including national action plans on Women, Peace and Security, and throughout all transition and recovery strategies. Ensure these action plans are multi-sectoral and supported by widespread protective legislation as well as capacity building across all key sectors to monitor and address risks for violence.</li>\n<li>In the reconstruction phase, undertake programming to build social and economic assets of women and girls in order to limit their future exposure to violence, through, for example, education, livelihoods, lifeskills, and leadership. Support women\u2019s and girls\u2019 empowerment in new and existing constitutions, bolstered by national mechanisms, government programs, and civil society partnerships, particularly women\u2019s organisations addressing violence against women and girls. Identify and address risks related to perpetration of violence, particularly amongst boys who have been exposed to violence and in terms of limiting the availability of small arms.</li>\n<li>In post-conflict settings, ensure the inclusion of women and girls in peace-building efforts at the national and local levels. Include elements addressing violence against women and girls committed during conflict in all peace agreements. Ensure that survivors have safe access to on-going care and treatment in all conflict-related transitional justice and reparations programmes. Include an emphasis on the special needs of women and girls who were part of fighting forces in programmes for disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration, and efforts to prevent future violence against women and girls, including by demobilised male soldiers. Work with families and communities to overcome prejudice and discrimination against women ex-combatants and women heads of household. Ensure an end to impunity by integrating prevention of (and response to) violence against women and girls into all security sector and justice reform.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><span id=\"Girls.2C_adolescent_girls_and_young_women\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Girls,_adolescent_girls_and_young_women\">Girls, adolescent girls and young women</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=EGM:_prevention_of_violence_against_women_and_girls&amp;action=edit&amp;section=17\" title=\"Edit section: Girls, adolescent girls and young women\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Young_girl_applying_cosmetics.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/Young_girl_applying_cosmetics.jpg/220px-Young_girl_applying_cosmetics.jpg\" width=\"220\" height=\"147\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/Young_girl_applying_cosmetics.jpg/330px-Young_girl_applying_cosmetics.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/Young_girl_applying_cosmetics.jpg/440px-Young_girl_applying_cosmetics.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"3456\" data-file-height=\"2304\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Young_girl_applying_cosmetics.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div><i>Girls, adolescent girls and young women.</i> (Recommendation 142)</div></div></div>\n<p><i>Recommendation 142</i><br />\nExperts recognised that girls, including adolescent girls, and young women are often excluded from, or \u2018squeezed into,\u2019 interventions which are focussed on adult women, on boys and young men, or on children in a gender-neutral way. Experts concluded that an emphasis on prevention work specifically tailored to the needs, experiences and aspirations of girls,\nadolescent girls and young women is urgently needed; acknowledging the complexities of the current landscape that they are required to negotiate. Experts made the following recommendations to States, women\u2019s and civil society organisations, international and regional institutions, public and private sectors, as appropriate:\n</p>\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Develop, implement and monitor tailored prevention activity with adolescent girls and young women that takes an empowerment, not protection, approach, and explicitly address their needs and rights, informed by the voices of adolescent girls and young women themselves. The onus is often placed on girls and young women to avoid / stop violence from happening to them rather than on developing widespread and embedded activities which challenge the social norms that permeate their lives. Prevention programmes should therefore address what is happening around young people (e.g. social pressures, media messaging and so forth) rather than purely on helping young women to \u2018manage\u2019 their adolescence (and the risks of violence this is assumed to entail) more effectively.</li>\n<li>Support all adolescents and young people to understand the nature of consent and coercion, and the impact of social and environmental factors on individual ability to truly provide consent (e.g. with key messages such as <i>\u2018your <b>yes</b> is only as good as your ability to say <b>no</b></i>\u2019). The issue of consent, and especially sexual consent, is complex and is widely misunderstood among many adults. Yet adolescent girls and young women are often expected to be able to negotiate this difficult terrain which is focussed exclusively on the nature of a \u2018no\u2019 rather than the expectation that what is required is a strong, enthusiastic \u2018yes\u2019. This in turn reinforces notions of female passivity (the object of pursuit) and male aggressor (the pursuer). Such activities would have relevance to a number of areas from teen relationships to forced marriage.</li>\n<li>Ensure a gender dimension is incorporated into multi-sectoral legislative, policy and programmatic development to prevent (and respond to) violence against children, taking into account the specific needs, vulnerabilities and voices of girls of all ages.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><span
