The Gruber Prize for Women's Rights, established in 2003, was one of five international prizes worth US$500,000 awarded by The Peter and Patricia Gruber Foundation, an American non-profit organization. The Peter and Patricia Gruber Foundation Women's Rights Prize was presented to an individual or group that has made significant contributions, often at great personal or professional risk, to furthering the rights of women and girls in any area and to advancing public awareness of the need for gender equality to achieve a just world. Recipients were selected by a distinguished panel of international women's rights experts/activists from nominations that are received from around the world. The Foundation honored and encouraged educational excellence, social justice and scientific achievements that better the human condition. In 2011, the Prize for Women's Rights was discontinued.
