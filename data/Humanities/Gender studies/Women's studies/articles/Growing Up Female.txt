Growing Up Female: A Personal Photo-Journal (1974) was a "landmark"  book of photography by photojournalist Abigail Heyman (1942-2013).    Heyman introduced the book, writing "This book is about women, and their lives as women, from one feministâ€™s point of view."   The book collected photographs of Heyman's life, "challeng[ing] assumptions about being a woman", and "documented the female experience from a feminist perspective."   Andy Grundberg described the book as "test[ing] the line between reportage and personal expression."  The book portrayed numerous black-and-white images of women in various activities, including a photograph of Ms. Heyman herself having an abortion.   During the 1970s, the work sold more than 35,000 copies, and was a mainstay of women's bookstores and feminist literature displays, along with Our Bodies, Ourselves.
