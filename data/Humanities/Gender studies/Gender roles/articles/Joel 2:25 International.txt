P.O. Box 795471  Joel 2:25 International, Inc. is a non-profit ministry organization providing a network of support groups for individuals in the ex-gay movement. Joel 2:25 International, Inc. was incorporated in the state of Texas on November 26, 2013 as a non-profit organization.  Joel 2:25 International, Inc. ("Joel 2:25") holds local in-person meetings in Dallas, Texas and other major US cities as well as daily, weekly, and monthly video-conferences with 27 groups consisting of individual participants from 92 countries.  On a monthly basis, Joel 2:25 hosts guest speakers for in-depth topics from ministry, emotional healing, and reparative Therapy. Guest speakers have included Joseph Nicolosi of the National Association for Research & Therapy of Homosexuality (NARTH) and other leaders from the Restored Hope Network, and the International Healing Foundation.  The organization began as a local support group in Dallas, Texas but quickly grew through video-conferencing and social media.  Verse 2:25 from the Hebrew Book of Joel states: "I will restore to you the years that the swarming locust has eaten, the hopper, the destroyer, and the cutter. The great army sent among you."  The organization selected this name "Joel 2:25" because the verse describes healing and restoration. The organization's website states: "In Joel 2:25, "The hopper, the destroyer, the great cutter, and great army” depict successive waves of scourge after scourge. They did not all come in one year, or two years, but year after year as it states in the plural 'Years.' They destroyed not only one crop, but they completely ate up all buds and seedlings; leaving a barren wasteland that could only be restored with Super-natural intervention. For many of us, the relational wounds and brokenness underlying homosexuality have destroyed multiple years and caused relational wounds that made recovery and healthy affirmation difficult to take-in. God’s promise in Joel 2:25 implies a 'recompense.' He can give us fruitful YEARS as a compensation for those in which the locust ate up the fruits of the earth. This means far more than sexual sobriety and abstinence. It is a healing of emotional wounds and relational brokenness; development of true identity as men of God, fulfillment of needs, and multiple fruitful years of mission and purpose that lead to Joy."Joel 2:25 supports individual freedom of conscience for all, but believes that sexual purity is a life and death matter. In this regard, the organization differs from the theological views of Alan Chambers, the former leader of Exodus International. Joel 2:25 believes: "Sexual holiness for Christians matters to such an extent that living an unrepentant sexually immoral life can get even self-professed Christians excluded from the kingdom of God. ( Matt 5:29-30; John 8:11 with 5:14; 1 Thess 4:3-8; Gal 5:19-21; 1 Cor 5; 6:9-10, 13-20; 2 Cor 12:21; Rom 1:23-32; Col 3:5-7; Eph 4:19; 5:3-6; 1 Tim 1:9-11.) Some Christian theologians would say that this may mean that such persons were never true Christians to begin with. Others would explain that it may mean that such persons have fallen away from a once genuine faith. Either way, all orthodox Christian theologians would agree that a life committed to unrepentant, sexual immorality is evidence of a life not lived by saving faith. (Matt 5:29-30; 7:16-27; Mark 4:16-19; John 15:1-6; Rom 8:12-14; Gal 6:7-9; Heb 10:26-29; James 2:14-26; 2 Pet 2:18-21; 1 John 1:6-7; 2:3-6, 15, 29; 3:6-10, 14-20, 24; 5:18; Rev 2:4-17, 20-23, 26; 3:1-3, 5.)'' Joel 2:25 received increased media attention and scrutiny when it was revealed that the organization's founder, Jeremy Schwab, had authored the platform amendment for the 2014 Republican Party of Texas platform to protect the right of access to reparative therapy.      Joel 2:25 is a public charity and does not take positions on political parties, candidates, or issues. Schwab issued personal statements in defense of the platform plank on television and in his personal blog   and was also defended by other activists and organizations such as Focus on the Family,   Daryl L. Foster, of the Gay Christian Movement Watch,   and Texas Values.  While Joel 2:25 is not officially a "member" ministry of any network, it has received encouragement and public support from a variety of organizations, including: PATH (Positive Alternative to Homosexuality),  the International Healing Foundation, and Homosexuals Anonymous.  According to its website, Joel 2:25 works with individuals and small groups with resources and ongoing video-conference groups in English, Spanish, Arabic, Portuguese, Italian, Japanese, Urdu, German, Ukrainian, French, Macedonian, Russian, Croatian, and Farsi.  The founder of Joel 2:25 participated in an hour-long Christian television broadcast to Iran in Persian via satellite through Iran Alive Ministries.
