Transfeminine is an umbrella term describing individuals who were assigned male at birth but align more closely with the female side of the gender spectrum.  A transfeminine individual may identify with many aspects of femininity but not wish to describe themselves as "a woman",  and so may choose to behave in ways that are typically associated with men.
