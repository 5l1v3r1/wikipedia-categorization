Hartman, then Dean of Douglass, began to meet informally with the directors of the women\u2019s programs and centers located on the Douglass campus. These gatherings became a forum for working collaboratively to develop and strengthen women\u2019s education at Rutgers and to consider the critical underrepresentation of women in leadership in all arenas at the local, national and international levels. In 1991, under Mary Hartman\u2019s leadership, the directors formed a consortium to address this underrepresentation. Declaring the mission of the Institute as \u201cdedicated to examining issues of leadership and advancing women\u2019s leadership in education, research, politics, the workplace, and the world,\u201d the founding directors established the Institute as a collaborative enterprise, the nation\u2019s first consortium dedicated to women\u2019s lives and leadership.\n</p><p>The founding directors of the new Institute for Women\u2019s Leadership were: \n</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Mary_S._Hartman\" title=\"Mary S.
