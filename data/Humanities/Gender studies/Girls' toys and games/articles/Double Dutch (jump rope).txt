Double Dutch is a game in which two long jump ropes turning in opposite directions are jumped by one or more players jumping simultaneously. It is popular worldwide.  Competitions in double Dutch range from block parties to the world level. During the spring of 2009, double Dutch became a varsity sport in New York City public high schools.  It has  been fancifully debated whether double Dutch came over with the first Dutch settlers or appeared in the first half of the 1900s.

A jumper usually performs tricks that may involve gymnastics or breakdance, and may also incorporate fancy foot movements.
