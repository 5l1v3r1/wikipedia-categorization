Discwoman is a New York based collective, booking agency, and event platform representing and showcasing female-identified (cis women, trans women, and gender queer) talent in the electronic music community. It was founded in 2014 by Frankie Decaiza Hutchinson (outreach, PR, and social media), Emma Burgess-Olson (DJ UMFANG), and Christine McCharen-Tran (event production, business relations).  Discwoman's regular club nights and touring events highlight emerging and established artists from around the world,  including The Black Madonna, Nicole Moudaber, Star Eyes, Sandunes, Demian Licht, and Nina Sonik. Overall, the collective seeks to highlight and correct the gender imbalance in EDM club and festival lineups.   Discwoman events provide a platform to feminine-identified talent by booking them at bigger venues, streamlining the growth process, and ensuring artists receive fair payment.   Since its inaugural event at Bushwick, Brooklynâ€™s Bossa Nova Civic Club,  Discwoman has presented showcases in Boston,  Detroit's Movement Festival,  Mexico City,   Montreal,  Philadelphia,  Pittsburgh's VIA Festival,  San Juan,  Seattle's Decibel Festival,  and Toronto.  The group, particularly Hutchinson, was involved in the 2017 campaign that repealed New York's anti-dancing Cabaret Law.     female:pressure report 03, 2015
