The Commission is committed to promoting diversity and equality, fostering an inclusive society in which all individuals are treated with respect and dignity.  The Commission's mission is to eliminate discrimination, to promote equal opportunities, and to help people understand their rights and obligations under Hong Kong's anti-discrimination legislation and provide redress for discrimination. At present, the anti-discrimination ordinances in Hong Kong are: The main functions of the EOC are to: investigate complaints and issues related to its mandate to uphold the anti-discrimination ordinances and act as an intermediary between affected parties, to issues codes of practice and guidelines for implementing the ordinances, to propose legislative amendments relevant to the elimination of discrimination, and to provide educational services to promote awareness of the ordinances.  In 2003, Michael Wong Kin-chow was removed as the Chairman of the EOC after an investivation by the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) revealed that Mr Wong had deliberately made improper applications to the HKSAR government for reimbursement of several first-class flights between 1998 and 2001, valued at HK$171,666.  It was also reported that Mr Wong had continued to draw his pension as a former High Court judge while he was employed at the EOC. The ICAC's report was submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) in November 2005 who ultimately decided not to proceed with prosecution.  On 1 June 2016, a concern was raised by some legislators that the newly appointed Chairperson, Prof Alfred Chen, had expressed views which suggested he was not suitably aware of the key issues necessary to execute his duties as head of the EOC. These included a dismissal of the need to address the lack of any anti-discrimination ordinance to protect sexual minorities, confusion of concepts such as gender identity and sexual orientation, and declaring that the EOC should echo the views of the government.
