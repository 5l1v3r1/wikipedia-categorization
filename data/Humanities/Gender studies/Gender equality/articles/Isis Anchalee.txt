 Isis Anchalee is a Canadian full-stack engineer. She employed by OneLogin and later Uber,  and the founder of the #ilooklikeanengineer hashtag created in order to promote discussion of gender equality in tech after the OneLogin featured her face in an ad campaign.  Anchalee is also on the Advisory Board of Women Who Code. Anchalee created #ilooklikeanengineer (an example of hashtag activism) when she received derogatory comments about her face being featured in an ad campaign for OneLogin.  Anchalee feels that most people are "...well intentioned but genuinely blind to a lot of [things] that those who do not identify as male have to deal with."   One year after the launch of #ilooklikeanengineer 250,000 plus people had used the hashtag.   Her Facebook account was suspended due to similarities between her given name and the terrorist group ISIS,    but her account was later reactivated.
