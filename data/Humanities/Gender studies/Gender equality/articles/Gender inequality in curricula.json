Moreover they are defined as sets of objectives, content, resources and assessment. Informal curricula, also defined as <a href=\"/wiki/Hidden_curriculum\" title=\"Hidden curriculum\">hidden</a> or unofficial, refer to attitudes, values, beliefs, assumptions, behaviours and undeclared agendas underlying the learning process.

Indeed, it can happen that the language itself can communicate the status of being male or female, and the status of being assertive or submissive. In many cultures, 'being male' is expressed in language as being confident. In Japan, according to Pavlenko,<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> female Japanese learners are led 'to see English as a language of empowerment. The students state that ... the pronoun system of English allow[s] them to position and express themselves differently as more independent individuals than when speaking Japanese.' This example clearly shows how languages, reflecting cultures, are the basis for introducing gender inequalities highlighting the curricula.<sup id=\"cite_ref-:0_1-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:0-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Curriculum_structure_and_gender\">Curriculum structure and gender</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Gender_inequality_in_curricula&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Curriculum structure and gender\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Many Teacher Education Institutes (TEIs) around the world, which set curricula, i.e. teaching diplomas, show a worrying shortcoming regarding issues of gender equality. For instance, students who prove being prepared to become schoolteachers are taught on education theories, the <a href=\"/wiki/Psychology_of_learning\" title=\"Psychology of learning\">psychology of learning</a>, teaching methodologies and class management, among others and one or two practical courses. There is no highlight on gender equality-related issues in their training.  Even courses on curriculum design ignore these issues. This omission is highly problematic and should be addressed by curriculum designers of TEIs. It is important that gender equality issues are part of the curriculum in order to help future teachers to be more sensitive about gender equality issues. Thus when they become teachers, they can become agents of change in their schools.<sup id=\"cite_ref-:0_1-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:0-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Content_of_instructional_materials_and_gender\">Content of instructional materials and gender</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Gender_inequality_in_curricula&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Content of instructional materials and gender\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Teachers often use materials, including texts, images or examples that reinforce stereotyped roles. Typical examples given include, roles of the father (reading the newspaper) and the mother (serving dinner); the doctor (male) and the nurse (female); playing ball (boy) and combing doll's hair (girl). By doing this, teachers are also promoting gender bias which favors girls as well. For instance, bullying and noise-making for boys and politeness and gentleness for girls. Gender bias does not only favor males over females; it can also go the other way around. They are both negative when considering a healthy relationship between the teacher and the learner.<sup id=\"cite_ref-:0_1-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:0-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"A_gender_equal_curriculum\">A gender equal curriculum</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Gender_inequality_in_curricula&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: A gender equal curriculum\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>A gender equal curriculum shows the diversity of society when increasing examples that highlight successful female characters in texts as well as in the examples used during classes. Instructional materials, including textbooks, handouts or workbooks, should be studies to determine whether they are gender biased, gender neutral or gender-sensitive/responsive. In Teacher Education Institutes (TEIs), curricula need to include elements that recognize gender equality-related issues in learning materials, and how those issues can be faced by teachers once they take up the profession and start to use these materials in their classes.<sup id=\"cite_ref-:0_1-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:0-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Quality curriculum should include gender equality as a result of teaching and learning in TEIs, as well as in schools.

Each lesson includes an assignment-type lesson, for instance creating a storyboard, an art work or conducting a role play on the topic of that lesson. Evaluation of the programme (with the use of a quasi-experimental design) showed a significant positive effects on non-coercive sex within students in intervention groups.
