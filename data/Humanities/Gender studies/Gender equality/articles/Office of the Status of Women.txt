The Office for Women is a department of the Australian Government "to deliver policies and programmes to advance gender equality and improve the lives of Australian women"  In 2013, a number of federal government departments were restructured, including the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet which took responsibility for the Office of the Status of Women.  In December 2017, the Office for Women released the report, "Gender Balance on Australian Government Boards Report 2016-17" to show "the Governmentâ€™s performance against its gender diversity target on Australian Government boards."  The report found that, "On 1 July 2016, the Government set a target of women holding 50% of Australian Government board positions overall, and at least 40% representation of women and 40% representation of men on individual boards. As at 30 June 2017, women held 42.7% of Australian Government board positions. This is the highest outcome since public reporting on the gender balance of Government boards began in 2011. Statistics on new appointments made in 2016-17 show how individual portfolios have progressed towards meeting the target. Of the 729 new appointments made in 2016-17, 46.2% of appointees were women. For seven of the 18 government portfolios, women comprised over 50% of new board appointments during 2016-17."
