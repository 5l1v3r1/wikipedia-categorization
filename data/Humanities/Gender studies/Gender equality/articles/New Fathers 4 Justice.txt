New Fathers 4 Justice is a UK-based direct action fathers' rights group campaigning for the rights of fathers to see their children. It is a splinter group of Fathers 4 Justice. New Fathers 4 Justice has a policy of not charging its supporters a fee, as they feel that dads need as much money and resource during the trying times of separation and divorce. New Fathers 4 Justice (NF4J) is a fathers' rights group. It was founded in September 2008 by disgruntled activists,  who were left awaiting trial when Fathers 4 Justice was shut down by Matt O'Connor.  The first protest was held on 19 September 2008 in Bristol, at the constituency office of Labour MP and Health Minister Dawn Primarolo. The protest was motivated by Primarolo's support of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act of 2008.  The group and still use Superhero costumes and comic characters in their direct action protests.
