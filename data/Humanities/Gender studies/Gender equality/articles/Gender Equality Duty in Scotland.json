Following this Duty requires acting by the rules posed by the <a href=\"/wiki/Scottish_Government\" title=\"Scottish Government\">Scottish Government</a>. It is each public body\u2019s duty to publish a gender equality scheme which is to be revised every three years. There also has to be an annual report on what actions were taken to achieve objectives outlined in the equality scheme. Objectives might be about how the authorities plan to abolish discrimination and harassment as well as the pay gap between men and women. But also many other factors play into the Gender Equality Duty. According to <a href=\"/wiki/Equal_Opportunities_Commission_(United_Kingdom)\" title=\"Equal Opportunities Commission (United Kingdom)\">Equal Opportunities Commission</a> women and men should also use their right on equality in relation to parental leave after child birth or adoption. Another important factor is that the Gender Equality Duty does not just apply to bigger companies. It also applies to public bodies as schools and to education in general.\n</p><p>It was replaced by a general equality duty under the <a href=\"/wiki/Equality_Act_2010\" title=\"Equality Act 2010\">Equality Act 2010</a>.\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Sex_discrimination\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Sex discrimination</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Equal_pay\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Equal pay</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#See_also\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">See also</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#External_links\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">External links</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sex_discrimination\">Sex discrimination</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Gender_Equality_Duty_in_Scotland&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Sex discrimination\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>According to Equality Commission there are four different kinds of sexual discrimination:\n</p><p><b>Direct discrimination:</b>\n</p><p>When one is directly discriminated it means that it is obvious to everybody that one is treated less favourably because of one\u2019s sex.\n</p><p>Example:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Dismissing a woman because she is pregnant.</li>\n<li>Dismissing a man because he wants to take paternity leave.</li></ul>\n<p><b>Harassment:</b>\n</p><p>Harassment is a form of direct discrimination which aims at violating one\u2019s dignity by talking to people in an overly suggestive manner or by touching.

With the Gender Equality Duty in 2007, it was stated that companies and public authorities have to publicly show <i>how</i> they want to improve the pay issue as a difference in payment shows gender discrimination. They are controlled regularly whether they achieved their objectives or not. Although the Equal Pay Act came into force almost several decades ago, there is still a pay gap of 15% between men and women doing the same work.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>According to the <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Close_the_Gap_Project&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Close the Gap Project (page does not exist)\">Close the Gap Project</a>, there are several reasons for differences in pay; the first one being that jobs are segregated regarding to gender. So it is normal to press men and women into stereotypical male or female occupations. The majority of women (72%) are employed in public administration, education and health. Typical male jobs are handy work, mechanical work with the 89% of male employees working in the field of construction <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/People/Equality/18500/StatisticsWomenMenScot#a6\">[1]</a>. It can also be seen that in high management position the percentage of men working there is higher than that of women working in similar positions. Another reason for the Pay Gap is the caring responsibility of women. As many workplaces lack flexible schedules women with caring responsibilities towards old or sick relatives, children or disabled people are more likely to look for part-time work which allows them to be more flexible. This can also be seen when having a closer look at the statistics. According to Esther Breitenbach and Fran Wasoff (A Gender Audit of Statistics: Comparing the Position of Women and Men in Scotland) about 55% of women work  part-time as it is one of the work arrangements with flexible working hours, compared to only 22% of men who do use this work arrangement.\n</p><p>In Scotland women earn 12 per cent less per hour than men when full-time salaries are compared. Women working part-time earn 32 per cent less per hour than men working full-time.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Gender_Equality_Duty_in_Scotland&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Legal_aspects_of_transsexualism#United_Kingdom\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Legal aspects of transsexualism\">Legal aspects of transsexualism in the United Kingdom</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Gender_equality\" title=\"Gender equality\">Gender equality</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Women%27s_rights\" title=\"Women&#39;s rights\">Women's rights</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Gender_Equality_Duty_in_Scotland&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><cite class=\"citation web\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/3/section/10\">\"Equality Act 2006 (Section 10)\"</a>. <i>Legislation.gov.uk</i>.
