The Free Bleeding Movement is a menstruation movement focusing on women's right to menstruate openly and without shame. The movement started in the 1970s as a reaction to toxic shock syndrome, a rare and sometimes fatal condition that can be caused when bacteria grow in tampons worn to absorb menstrual bleeding.   It regained popularity in 2014 as a result of a prank originating in the internet site 4chan.  As a result of this prank Kiran Gandhi ran in the London Marathon, while free bleeding.   The movement focuses on a woman's own comfort.   The movement has also led to free products for women in school bathrooms.  More recently, efforts have been made to extend this movement to transgender people who also menstruate as part of  "menstrual equality".  Some campuses are adding free menstrual products to men's bathrooms as well.  free bleeding panties are a result of the free bleeding movement that have received media attention.   These products are in response to the use of tampons.  Thinx, a popular brand of free bleeding underwear, launched a boy-shorts product in honor of Trans Awareness Week. The company changed their slogan to "underwear for people with periods" and hired a transman to model the product.
