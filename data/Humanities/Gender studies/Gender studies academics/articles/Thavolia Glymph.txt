Thavolia Glymph is an historian and professor. She is Professor of History and African-American Studies at Duke University.  Glymph earned her Ph.D. in economic history from Purdue University in 1994.  As an undergrad at Hampton University and fluent French speaker, Glymph had originally intended to major in European history or French, but an article by Purdue historian Harold Woodman on the profitability of slavery sparked her interest and she went on to pursue graduate work with Woodman.  Glymph's 2008 book, Out of the House of Bondage: The Transformation of the Plantation Household, won the Philip Taft Labor History Book Award  and was finalist for the Jefferson Davis Award for outstanding narrative work on the period of the Confederacy  and the Frederick Douglass Book Prize for the best book written in English on slavery or abolition.  In 2014, Glymph won the George and Ann Richards Prize prize for best article published in The Journal of the Civil War Era in 2013; her article, "Rose's War and the Gendered Politics of Slave Insurgency in the Civil War" described Rose's role as one of the leaders of a slave revolt.
