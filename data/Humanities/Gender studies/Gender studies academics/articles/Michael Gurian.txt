Dr. Michael Gurian is an American author and social philosopher.  He works as a marriage and family counselor and corporate consultant.  He has published twenty-eight books, several of which were New York Times bestsellers. He is considered, along with Leonard Sax, as one of the major proponents of the post-modern "single-sex academic classes" movement.    Gurian taught at Gonzaga University, Eastern Washington University, and Ankara University. His work tends to focus on gender differences and how they contribute to learning. His research has been referred to as essential to parents, advocates, administrators, and education practitioners.  He is also the founder of the Gurian Institute, which trains professionals who deal with the developmental aspects of childhood. The Gurian Institute has trained more than 60,000 teachers from over 2,000 different schools. Some of these schools become "GI Model Schools" and aim to leverage the role gender plays in learning styles.
