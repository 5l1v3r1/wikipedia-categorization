  Emma L. E. Rees is A Professor in the Department of English at the University of Chester.  Dr. Emma L. E. Rees is Senior Lecturer in English at the University of Chester, focusing on the early modern period, and on literature and film. Rees has written extensively on gender studies and representation, contributing chapters to a number of acclaimed academic works, including: The Female Body in Medicine and Literature (2011),  'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' and Philosophy (2011),  Studying English Literature (2009),  and Led Zeppelin and Philosophy (2009).  Rees is author of the entry on 'Sexual Politics' for The Encyclopaedia of Sex and Society (2010).  Rees' latest work is The Vagina: A Literary and Cultural History, published by Bloomsbury (August 2013).  Reviewing the book in British daily newspaper The Independent, Kaite Welsh began by saying, "For readers disappointed by Naomi Wolf's treatise on a similar topic last year, this is the book you’ve been waiting for. If Wolf's book was billed as Vagina: A New Biography, this could be subtitled A New Bibliography. An enjoyable romp through depictions of female genitalia from oral history to adverts, Rees examines the changing role of the cultural vagina." Welsh found that, "Although Rees is an academic by trade, the book gleefully mixes highbrow and lowbrow, from Chaucer to 21st-century horror", adding that, "If the book has a flaw, it is that it's mis-titled in the same way that Eve Ensler's Monologues were. This is a book more about the vulva itself than simply the vagina – labia and clitoris get their fair share of attention – but Rees acknowledges the sensationalist desire to talk simply about the part that gets penetrated and the way this obscures women's sexual desire. Would The Vulva Monologues have garnered quite that much attention?" She concluded her review by writing, "Rees lacks Wolf's sometimes po-faced anger, instead mixing her feminist outrage with a healthy dose of humour. Ever the cunning linguist, she leaves no pun unmade, but doesn’t skimp on the theory either, the perfect antidote for those feminists who find too much of the terminology dry and academic. This may not be the definitive text on the vagina – Rees is clear that she can't overturn centuries of embarrassment and taboo in a single book – but it's an excellent place to start."  Emma Rees is on the editorial board for the Gender Forum Journal, part of The Journal of Feminist Studies, and is also on the board for the Australian interdisciplinary gender, sexuality, and diversity studies journal, Writing From Below.
