Margot Bengtsson (born 1943) is a Swedish social psychologist, considered to be one of the leading gender studies academics of Scandinavia.  She is a Docent (i.e. Reader) Emerita at the Department of Psychology at Lund University. Her research focuses on gender, power, identity and social class. She has published extensively on women's and gender studies since the early 1970s.  Bengtsson's early work "focused on how society's needs for women to enter the workforce co-varied with trends in psychological research about sex differences." Her later work has "pursued the interactions between larger political changes and changes in gendered identities of Swedish young people."  She was a principal founder of the Department of Gender Studies at Lund University.
