  Elspeth Probyn (born 1958 ) is an Australian academic. She is currently Professor of Gender and Cultural Studies at the University of Sydney. She is a Fellow of the Australian Academy of the Humanities, and Fellow of the Academy of Social Sciences in Australia.   Concurrently, she holds positions as adjunct Professor of Cultural Geography at the University of Western Australia  and as adjunct Research Professor at the University of South Australia.  She received her Doctorate in Communications from Concordia University, 1989. She lectures and publishes in fields including cultural studies, media studies and sociology, with a particular focus on food, sexuality and the body. She has previously taught in Canada and the USA.  Probyn's work has helped to establish several new areas of scholarship â€“ from embodied research methods to cultural studies of food. Professor Probyn is the author of several groundbreaking monographs and over a hundred articles and chapters across the fields of gender, media, and cultural studies, philosophy, cultural geography, anthropology and critical psychology. Her current research includes questions about the sustainability of food production and consumption from an ethnographic and cultural perspective.  This draws from previous work on embodiment, gender, sexuality, ethics and cultural practice. Her exploration of these issues draws from contemporary debates about the more-than-human realm and the power of non-human agents and agencies. As of 2018, her most recent book is Eating the Ocean (2016).
