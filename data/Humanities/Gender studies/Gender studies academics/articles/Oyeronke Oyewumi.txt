Oyèrónkẹ́ Oyèwùmí is a Nigerian feminist scholar and associate professor of sociology at Stony Brook University.  She attended the University of Ibadan and the University of California at Berkeley.  Her 1997 monograph, The Invention of Women: Making an African Sense of Western Gender Discourses, won the American Sociological Association's 1998 Distinguished Book Award in the Gender and Sex category. In the book, she offers a postcolonial feminist critique of Western dominance in African studies, writing for instance that "despite voluminous scholarship to the contrary, gender was not an organizing principle in Yoruba society prior to colonization by the West."   Oyeronke's interdisciplinary work foregrounds an African vantage point, one that remains largely underrepresented in academia. Much of her academic research and writing has used African experiences to illuminate theoretical questions pertinent to a wide range of disciplines including sociology, political science, women studies, religion, history, and literature, all in an effort to broaden scholarly understanding to include non-Western cultures. In all of her work,   Oyeronke Oyewumi attempts to provide a more nuanced understanding of these societies, thereby avoiding reductionist formulations. In 2010, she received an invitation from the Center for Gender Studies at the University of Kazakhstan to be part of an international group working on a project, Gender, Nation, and Decoloniality in Central Asia.   One paragraph of her Gender Epistemology in the Eurasian Borderland (Moscow, 2009, in Russian, later published in English by Palgrave) is devoted to her book The Invention of Women .
