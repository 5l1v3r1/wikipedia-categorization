Harriet Malinowitz is an American academic scholar specializing in lesbian and gay issues in higher education, women's studies, the rhetoric of Zionism and Palestine, and writing theory and pedagogy. A Professor of English at Long Island University, Malinowitz earned her Ph.D. from New York University.  Notable works by Malinowitz include Textual Orientiations: Lesbian and Gay Students and the Making of Discourse Communities (Heinemann, 1995), an ethnographic study focusing on the community emerging in a college course that examines lesbian and gay experience. Textual Orientations highlights the productive intersections of two academic fields: rhetoric and composition and lesbian and gay studies while providing a pedagogical model that values the "vantage point of the social margin."  Malinowitz is also a writer of lesbian stand-up comedy, most notably for her partner Sara Cytron's shows A Dyke Grows in Brooklyn and Take My Domestic Partner--Please!
