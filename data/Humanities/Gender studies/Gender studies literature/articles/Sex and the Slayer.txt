Sex and the Slayer: A Gender Studies Primer for the "Buffy" Fan is an academic publication relating to the fictional Buffyverse established by TV series, Buffy and Angel. Written for undergraduates, Sex and the Slayer provides an introduction to feminism within mass media, specifically within the series Buffy. The book looks at how the show approaches gender. Jowett takes a feminist cultural studies approach,  exploring the ways in which the series represents femininity, masculinity, and gendered relations, (this includes sexuality and sexual orientation).  Jowett argues that Buffy presents a mixture of "subversive" and "conservative" portrayal of gender roles.
