The James Robert Brudner Memorial Prize and Lecture at Yale University celebrates lifetime accomplishment and scholarly contributions in the field of LGBT Studies.  It is bestowed annually by the Committee for LGBT Studies at Yale University.  Recipients receive a cash prize and give a public lecture on the Yale campus in New Haven, Connecticut as well as a second lecture in New York City. The prize is named for city planner, musician, and photographer James Brudner (1961-1998), a member of the Yale College class of 1983 and Stuyvesant High School Class of 1979.  Brudner died of AIDS-related illness on September 18, 1998.  Through his will he established the prize and lecture as "a perpetual annual prize for scholarship in the history, culture, anthropology, biology, etiology, or literature of gay men and lesbians or related fields, or for advancing the understanding of homosexuality as a phenomenon, or the tolerance of gay men and lesbians in society."
