TSQ: Transgender Studies Quarterly is a peer-reviewed academic journal devoted to transgender studies, with an emphasisis on cultural studies and the humanities.  It is the first non-medical journal in this area.  The founding editors-in-chief are Susan Stryker (University of Arizona) and Paisley Currah (Brooklyn College and Graduate Center, CUNY).  Stryker and Currah were alerted to the need for such a journal in 2008, when they co-edited a special transgender studies issue of Women's Studies Quarterly.   They needed 12 articles but received more than 200 submissions.   In May 2013, they started a month-long Kickstarter campaign to help fund the journal.  They received more than US$10,000 in donations in the first five days; by the end of the campaign, the journal had nearly US$25,000 in crowdfunded capital.   The first call for submissions drew a considerable amount of interest.  As such, the first issue was expanded into a book-length double issue comprising 86 essays.   Only two issues were published in 2016, as they were both double issues.
