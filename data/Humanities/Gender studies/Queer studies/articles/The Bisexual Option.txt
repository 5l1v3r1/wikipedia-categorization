The Bisexual Option (1978; second edition 1993) is a book by the sex researcher Fritz Klein. It is considered one of the seminal works on bisexuality in the discipline of queer studies.  The book shows bisexuals that they are not alone and discusses where people may fit on the sexual orientation continuum.  It also aids in explaining who bisexuals are and why they have problems in heterosexual as well as the mainstream gay/lesbian communities.
