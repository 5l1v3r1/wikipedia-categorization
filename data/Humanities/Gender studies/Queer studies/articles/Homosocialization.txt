Homosocialization or LGBT socialization is the process by which LGBT people meet, relate and become integrated in the LGBT community, especially with people of the same sexual orientation and gender identity,   helping to build their own identity as well.   The spaces of homosocialization are those physical or virtual places frequented by LGBTI people to meet other people of the community or to find sexual and loving partners, and where it is possible to express freely their sexual identity.   Before configuring places targeting specifically the LGBT community, the most regular practice to interact in the gay community was sexual encounters in certain outdoor places, such as parks or public baths.  Although much less frequent, nowadays cruising is still a common practice, especially among men who have sex with other men.  In the other hand, there are numerous businesses and associations targeting gender and sexual diversity that allow the meeting and socialization of LGBT community. In many cases, they emerge in LGBT villages, where the group is concentrated. However, many places are suffering the rivalry of social networks and internet to attract LGBT people.
