The Black Women's Defense League (BWDL) is a self-defense organization based in Dallas, Texas, United States.  The BWDL was founded in 2015  by Niecee X.  She was influenced by groups including the Huey P. Newton Gun Club but later split from them.   The BWDL describes itself as a Womanist organization.  According to the group's Facebook page, it "works for the immediate pursuit of an intersectional, safe, and free society" and "organizes to provide immediate protection and services to Black Women and those most marginalized by White Supremacy."  The group provides self-defense and arms training to "abused, underserved black women and marginalized genders",  and also engages in political education, charity work and youth outreach work.  In January 2017 BWDL members attended the Women's March in Washington, D.C.  In September 2017 the group was involved in relief efforts in Houston, Port Arthur and Beaumont, Texas, following Hurricane Harvey.    Its activities focused on groups otherwise overlooked by relief organizations and those excluded by shelters.  In December 2017 the BWDL organised a protest against a concert by R. Kelly in Dallas due to accusations of sexual misconduct.   In May 2018 the BWDL was featured in a documentary produced by Pabst Blue Ribbon, which sought to celebrate "the voices of today's ever-evolving American dream".
