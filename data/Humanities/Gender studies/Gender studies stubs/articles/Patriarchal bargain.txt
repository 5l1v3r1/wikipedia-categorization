Patriarchal bargain is a term coined by Turkish author and researcher Deniz Kandiyoti in 1988,   which describes a tactic in which a woman chooses to accommodate and uphold patriarchal norms, accepting gender roles that disadvantage women overall but maximizing her own power and options. It has been used to explain why women in patriarchal societies get married, wear veils, and conform to societal norms about sexual behaviour.  According to Kandiyoti, patriarchal bargaining changes in nature in different societies based on "class, caste, and ethnicity."  References
