Women of Truckee Making History is a book that celebrates local women for their contributions to the community of Truckee, California.  It was compiled, designed and edited by two Truckee women, Parvin Darabi and Lydia Sparksworthy.  The book is being published[when?] by the Dr. Homa Darabi Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to human rights issues mostly related to women.  The criteria for selecting the 30 women required applicants to live or work full-time in Truckee, and “to be actively involved in voluntarism which required dedication above and beyond normal eight-to-five, 40-hours-a week paid employment.”
