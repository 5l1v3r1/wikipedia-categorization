Amina Filali was a 16-year-old girl from Larache, Morocco, who committed suicide by taking rat poison in 2012 after she was forced to marry her rapist. According to Article 475 of Moroccan law, the rapist was allowed to avoid prosecution by marrying his victim. This incident drew much attention to Moroccan law, and many people expressed a desire to have the law changed.   Local human rights groups also called for the repeal of Article 475 of the Moroccan penal code which de-criminalises a rape if the rapist later marries their victim.    Two years after the suicide, the parliament decided to repeal Article 475; it was repealed in 2014.  A documentary about Amina Filali was released in 2013, which found that there had been four similar incidents in the town's history .
