The Brazilian Women's Articulation (in Portuguese Articulação das Mulheres Brasileiras) is a Brazilian feminist organization that links women's organizations in Brazil's 26 states and its federal district.  It was created to organize the Brazilian feminist movement's preparation and follow-up to the 1995 Beijing Women's Conference. In 2008, the AMB organized video conferences in order to publicise and promote awareness of the Lei Maria da Penha, a Brazilian anti-domestic violence law.
