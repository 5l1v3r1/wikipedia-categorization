Women Who Love Too Much is a self-help book by Robin Norwood published in 1985.  The book, which was a number one seller on the New York Times Best Seller list's "advice and miscellaneous" category in 1987,  is credited with "spawn[ing] a cottage industry in the therapy community."  Its premise, that women who get "mired in obsessive relationships"  are to help themselves, was criticized by some feminist scholars.
