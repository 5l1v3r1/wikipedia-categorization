However, it is known Saussure intended the term to mean internal, arrangement and relationship of rules understood by a social group, however, rarely thought of in everyday life. <i>Langue</i> is believed to be a universal structure and, while it may have variations as seen in foreign languages, with principal linguistic patterns.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Parole\">Parole</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Langue_and_parole&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Parole\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><i>Parole</i> typically when it is translated means speech. Saussure, on the other hand, intended for it to mean both the written and spoken language as experienced in everyday life. It is the precise utterances and use of <i>langue</i>. Therefore, <i>parole</i>, unlike <i>langue</i>, is as diverse and varied as the number of people who share a language and the number of utterances and attempts to use that language. Furthermore, <i>parole</i> is known to have been changed and manipulated by a number of causes for example time, social groups, and age of users.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"As_a_function\">As a function</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Langue_and_parole&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: As a function\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The underlying basis to <i>langue</i> is the interpretation that it is made up of signs and not sentences. Signs are thought to have a two part aspect in that each sign relates a notion with a sound pattern (or a written symbol). A sign cannot exist as a single part for if there is a sound pattern without a notion the sound becomes only noise. Similarly, a notion cannot be communicated without a sound pattern.\nThe sound pattern for each notion can be extremely diverse and vice versa. For example, the notion of oneself may use the sound patterns of 'I' or 'me' while the sound pattern of 'rose' may have the notion of a flower or the past of 'rise'. The notion or sound pattern remains unchanged even if the other changes. It is by understanding the relationship of the two parts of a sign through <i>langue</i> that the gist of communication or <i>parole</i> may be understood. Without the understanding of <i>langue</i>, <i>parole</i> would be meaningless sounds or symbols grouped together haphazardly.\nSaussure used the example of chess to explain how <i>langue</i> and <i>parole</i> work together. <i>Langue</i> is the normative rules in a chess game while parole represents the individual's choice of moves. If one were to study the parole of a chess game an understanding could be derived but it would not be a universal understanding of chess. However, by studying the langue of a chess game the derived understanding may be applicable to further chess games.\nThus Saussure argued when studying language, especially a foreign language, it is more important to understand the <i>langue</i> than to gain a large vocabulary of <i>parole</i> so that sense may be made equal to that of native speaker.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Course_in_general_linguistics\">Course in general linguistics</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Langue_and_parole&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Course in general linguistics\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Saussure did not publish his notes in relation to linguistics and <i>langue</i> and <i>parole</i>. Unfortunately Cours de linguistique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale was published after his death in 1916 (later translated into English in 1959 as <i>Course in General Linguistics</i>) and was made up of remaining lecture notes by Saussure, course notes provided to students and notes taken by former students of his lectures he performed between 1907-1911 in Geneva. This was then published by two of his former colleagues Charles Bally and Albert Sechehaye. It was after this publication that the importance and revolutionary nature of his work truly was understood by linguists and philosophers of his time.\nReviews, commentaries and critics of both the <i>Course in General Linguistics</i> and original notes made by Saussure have revealed much controversy over time. One controversy is that many ideas and notions often accredited to Saussure may have been borrowed from other linguists and philosophers of the nineteenth century. Saussure's idea of language as a sign system had been proposed by other philosophers, however, he will always be known to have provided a strong, theoretical basis for a scientific approach to understanding language as a whole.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Influence\">Influence</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Langue_and_parole&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Influence\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Saussure's <i>langue</i> and <i>parole</i> form one of the theoretical foundations of structuralism. <i>Langue</i> and <i>parole</i> have allowed structuralists to separately examine the broad structures and formations of literature as well as the individual words. Structuralists achieved this by making a distinction within literary works between the words on a page (<i>parole</i>) and the context behind these words (<i>langue</i>). Although the reader may appear to simply be reading the words in a book their ability to understand (or possibly misunderstand) the text is a result of a person's knowledge of the <i>langue</i> or rules of a certain language. Similarly, <i>langue</i> and <i>parole</i> have been highly influential in the study of the signs, termed semiotics. Saussure's most notable influence on semiotics was his belief that the rules and codes of a language (<i>langue</i>) are vital in interpreting and gaining an understanding of that language system, while individual utterances (<i>parole</i>) are of little significance. <i>Langue</i> and <i>parole</i> have also impacted the way language is taught. Since Saussure's terms have become well known, language teaching often emphasizes teaching the langue and how these rules are applied, rather than simply teaching the words of a certain language. Additionally, <i>langue</i> and <i>parole</i> have been applied to other fields of study. Anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss used Structuralism and <i>langue</i> and <i>parole</i> to understand myths and tales within a broader context. In this case parole is a single tale or myth, while langue is considered the broader range of tales and myths from within a series or group. These may be myths from the same community, time period or geographical location.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Langue_and_parole&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">de Saussure, F.
