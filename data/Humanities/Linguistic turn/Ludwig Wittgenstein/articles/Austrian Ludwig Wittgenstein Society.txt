Institute Vienna Circle  The Austrian Ludwig Wittgenstein Society was first established in 1974 to promote philosophical conferences, workshops, summer schools, and research that are inspired by the work of Ludwig Wittgenstein and the Vienna Circle.    It is an international society, which also has a publication series.  In 1974, Elisabeth Leinfellner, Werner Leinfellner, Rudolf Haller, Paul Weingartner, and Adolf Hübner founded the Austrian Ludwig Wittgenstein Society (ALWS), but it was the impetus of the first International Wittgenstein Symposium in Kirchberg am Wechsel, Lower Austria that led to its development as an international society. The location of the ALWS is in Kirchberg am Wechsel and the location was selected because Ludwig Wittgenstein taught at elementary schools close Kirchberg am Wechsel in the 1920s.  The ALWS has two primary goals.  They currently report 120 members both national and international.  Individuals can download an application form their website.  Membership is decided by the Executive Committee of the ALWS based on academic criteria.  Students pay half the fee.  Members receive a 30% discount on fees for the International Wittgenstein Symposium and for ALWS publications.
