Some Remarks on Logical Form  (German: Bemerkungen Ã¼ber logische Form) was the only academic paper ever published by Ludwig Wittgenstein, and contained Wittgenstein's thinking on logic and the philosophy of mathematics immediately before the rupture that divided the early Wittgenstein of the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus from the later Wittgenstein.  The approach to logical form in the paper reflected Frank P. Ramsey's critique of Wittgenstein's account in the Tractatus, and has been analyzed by G.E.M. Anscombe and Jaakko Hintikka, among others.
