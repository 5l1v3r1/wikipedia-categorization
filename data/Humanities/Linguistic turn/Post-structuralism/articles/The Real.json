Unlike the symbolic, which is constituted in terms of oppositions such as \"presence\" and \"absence\", there is no absence in the real. The symbolic opposition between \"presence\" and \"absence\" implies the possibility that something may be missing from the symbolic, the real is \"always in its place: it carries it glued to its heel, ignorant of what might exile it from there.\" If the symbolic is a set of differentiated signifiers, the real is in itself undifferentiated: \"it is without fissure.\" The symbolic introduces \"a cut in the real,\" in the process of signification: \"it is the world of words that creates the world of things.\" Thus the real emerges as that which is outside language: \"it is that which resists symbolization absolutely.\" The real is impossible because it is impossible to imagine, impossible to integrate into the symbolic order. This character of impossibility and resistance to symbolization lends the real its traumatic quality.\n</p><p>The primordial Real in which a (pre-<a href=\"/wiki/Oedipal\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Oedipal\">Oedipal</a>) human subject is born is differentiated from the real which a subject integrated into the <a href=\"/wiki/Symbolic_order\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Symbolic order\">symbolic order</a> experiences. In the former, the real is the continuous, \u201cwhole\u201d reality without categories and the differential function of language. Following the <a href=\"/wiki/Mirror_stage\" title=\"Mirror stage\">mirror stage</a>, however, and the eventual entrance of the imaginary and the symbolic (the split of the subject between the conscious imaginary and the unconscious symbolic), the real may only be experienced as traumatic gaps in the symbolic order. An example of this are traumatic events such as natural disasters, which effectively break down the signification of everyday life and cause a rupture of something alien and unrecognizable, without the usual grammar of the symbolic that conditions how to make meaning of something and how to proceed.\n</p><p>One of the main methods of psychoanalysis is to drain the traumatic experiences of the real into the symbolic through free association. The analyst searches the analysand\u2019s discourse for sounds, words, or images of fixation and through dialectization attempt to bring these fixations to the regular <a href=\"/wiki/Metonymy\" title=\"Metonymy\">metonymic</a> flow of the (unconscious) symbolic order, thereby integrating the subject further into their fantasy, usually referred to as \u201ctraversing the fantasy.\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\".C5.BDi.C5.BEek\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"\u017di\u017eek\">\u017di\u017eek</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=The_Real&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: \u017di\u017eek\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Contemporary Slovenian philosopher <a href=\"/wiki/Slavoj_%C5%BDi%C5%BEek\" title=\"Slavoj \u017di\u017eek\">Slavoj \u017di\u017eek</a> has expanded on Lacan's theories and described (at least) three modalities of the Real:<sup id=\"cite_ref-Daly2004_2-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Daly2004-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<ul><li>The \"real Real\": a horrific thing, that which conveys the sense of <a href=\"/wiki/Horror_(emotion)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Horror (emotion)\">horror</a> in horror films</li>\n<li>The \"symbolic real\": the signifier reduced to a meaningless formula like <a href=\"/wiki/Quantum_physics\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Quantum physics\">quantum physics</a>, which cannot be understood in any meaningful way, only grasped through abstract mathematics.</li>\n<li>The \"imaginary real\": an unfathomable something that permeates things as a trace of the sublime.

To know it and to live in it is man's true destiny. His point of contact with it is personality: the inward fount of his being: his heart, not his head. Man is real, and in the deepest sense alive, in virtue of this free personal life-principle within him; but he is bound and blinded by the ties set up between his surface-intelligence and the sense-world. The struggle for reality must be a struggle on man's part to transcend the sense-world, escape its bondage. He must renounce it, and be 're-born' to a higher level of consciousness; shifting his centre of interest from the natural to the spiritual plane. According to the thoroughness with which he does this, will be the amount of real life he enjoys. The initial break with the 'world,' the refusal to spend one\u2019s life communing with one\u2019s own cinematograph picture, is essential if the freedom of the infinite is to be attained. We are amphibious creatures: our life moves upon two levels at once\u2014the natural and the spiritual. The key to the puzzle of man lies in the fact that he is \"the meeting point of various stages of Reality.\" All his difficulties and triumphs are grounded in this. The whole question for him is, which world shall be central for him\u2014the Real, vital, all-embracing life we call spirit, or the lower life of sense? Shall 'Existence,' the superficial obvious thing, or 'Substance,' the underlying verity, be his home? Shall he remain the slave of the senses with their habits and customs, or rise to a plane of consciousness, of heroic endeavour, in which\u2014participating in the life of spirit\u2014he knows reality because he is real?\" (<a href=\"/wiki/Evelyn_Underhill\" title=\"Evelyn Underhill\">Evelyn Underhill</a> (1911), <i>Mysticism</i>, <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://archive.org/stream/mysticismstudyin00undeuoft#page/40/mode/2up\">p. 40</a>)</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\"There are,\" says <a href=\"/wiki/Plotinus\" title=\"Plotinus\">Plotinus</a>, \"different roads by which this end [apprehension of the Infinite] may be reached.

At a certain point the harmony becomes so complete, and the finality so close that it gives us actual emotion. The Beautiful then becomes the sublime; brief apparition, by which the soul is caught up into the true mystic state, and touches the Absolute, the Real. It is scarcely possible to persist in this Esthetic perception without feeling lifted up by it above things and above ourselves, in an ontological vision which closely resembles the Absolute of the Mystics.

Retrieved <span class=\"nowrap\">17 August</span> 2012</span>. <q>The real Real is the hard limit that functions as the horrifying Thing (the Alien, Medusa's head, maelstrom and so on) - a shattering force of negation. The symbolic Real refers to the anonymous symbols and codes (scientific formulae, digitalisation, empty signifiers...) that function in an indifferent manner as the abstract \"texture\" onto which, or out of which, reality is constituted. In The Matrix, for example, the symbolic Real is given expression at the point where Neo perceives \"reality\" in terms of the abstract streams of digital output. In the contemporary world, Zizek argues that it is capital itself that provides this essential backdrop to our reality and as such represents the symbolic Real of our age (Zizek, 1999: 222; 276). With the <i>imaginary real</i> we have precisely the (unsustainable) dimension of fantasmatic excess-negation that is explored in Flatliners. This is why cyberspace is such an ambiguous imaginary realm.</q></cite><span
