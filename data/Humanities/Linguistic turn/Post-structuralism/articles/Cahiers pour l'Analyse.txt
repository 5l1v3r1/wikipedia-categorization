Cahiers pour l'Analyse was a magazine published in Paris in the 1960s. Ten issues appeared between 1966 and 1969. It was "guided by the examples of Georges Canguilhem, Jacques Lacan and Louis Althusser".  Edited by a small group of Althusser's students at the Ecole Normale Supérieure, the magazine appeared during what were – arguably – the most fertile and productive years in French philosophy during the whole of the twentieth century.
