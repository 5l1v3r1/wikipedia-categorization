The Institute Vienna Circle (IVC) (Society for the Advancement of the Scientific World Conception), founded in October 1991 is an international nonprofit organization  which is dedicated to the work and influence of the Vienna Circle of Logical Empiricism. Since 2011 the IVC is also a subunit of the Faculty of Philosophy and Education at the University of Vienna. The Institute’s founder and scientific director is Friedrich Stadler. Its goal is the documentation and continued development of the Vienna Circle's work in science and public education, areas which have been neglected until now, as well as the maintenance and application of logical-empircial, critical-rational and linguistic analytical thought and construction of a scientific philosophy and world view in conjunction with general socio-cultural trends. One of the Institute's main objectives is to democratize knowledge and science as a process of enlightenment, counteracting all forms of irrational, dogmatic or fundamentalist thought, in a societal context and taking into account the latest developments in international research. The IVC hosts a unique research library of outstanding value to researchers all over the world. It includes jewels such as Otto Neurath's Private Library, the Robert S. Cohen Collection and Archives, the Adolf Grünbaum Archives, the Kurt Blaukopf Library, the Kurt R. Fischer Library and the Eugene T. Gadol Library.
