Béla Juhos (November 22, 1901, Vienna – May 27, 1971, Vienna) was a Hungarian-Austrian philosopher and member of the Vienna Circle. Juhos was born November 22, 1901 in Vienna into a Hungarian family of low nobility (Hungarian citizenship until 1945). His father was a Hungarian tradesman and entrepreneur owning an iron wholesale in Vienna and Budapest. Juhos attended primary school in Budapest and spoke Hungarian as a child.  In 1909 he moved to Vienna, where he learned German and completed Realgymnasium in 1920. Juhos studied mathematics, physics and philosophy at the University of Vienna. In 1926 he completed his studies with a dissertation under Moritz Schlick with the title "To What Extent did Schopenhauer Do Justice to Kantian Ethics?" ("Inwieweit ist Schopenhauer der Kant’schen Ethik gerecht geworden?"). From the beginning of the Schlick Circle in 1924 until its dissolution in 1936 (after the murder of Schlick) Juhos participated in the meetings of the Vienna Circle. Due to his economic independence Juhos could stay in Vienna as a private scholar during the Second World War – except for the period of his military service in 1942–1944. Together with Victor Kraft Juhos was the only member of the Vienna Circle to remain in Vienna during the Second World War and to continue to work at the University of Vienna after the war.  In 1948 he submitted his Habilitation thesis (venia legendi) with the title "Cognition and its Achievements" ("Die Erkenntnis und ihre Leistung") under Victor Kraft and became Privatdozent (private lecturer). In 1955, Juhos was appointed associate professor, but he did not obtain a permanent position at the Faculty of Philosophy. For this reason, his influence in research and teaching remained limited. Juhos died on May 27, 1971 in Vienna.
