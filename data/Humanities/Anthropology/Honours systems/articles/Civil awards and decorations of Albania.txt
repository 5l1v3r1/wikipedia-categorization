Civil awards and decorations of Albania are the awards and decorations that have been bestowed in Albania since its declaration of independence in 1912. The first decoration to be given in modern Albania is considered to be the Order of the Black Eagle, which was granted by the Principality of Albania in 1913.  In 1925, Ahmet Zogu, while President of Albania, instituted the Order of Skanderbeg. In 1926, he established the Order of Fidelity, also known as the Order of Besa.  Several laws were passed during Communist Albania. In 1960, the law On the creation of the honorary titles in the arts sector (Albanian: Mbi krijimin e titujve të nderit në sektorin e arteve) was passed by the Parliament of Albania.  In 1980, another law, entitled On the honorary titles and decorations in the Socialist People's Republic of Albania (Albanian: Për titujt e nderit dhe dekoratat e Republikës Popullore Socialiste të Shqipërisë), amended the 1960 law.  In 1996, the Parliament of Albania passed the law entitled On the decorations in the Republic of Albania (Albanian: Për dekoratat në Republikën e Shqipërisë).  An addition to the 1996 law was made in 2001.  A regulation on the awarding of the decorations was issued afterwards by President Alfred Moisiu.   97 different types of awards were given in Communist Albania during 1945–1990.
