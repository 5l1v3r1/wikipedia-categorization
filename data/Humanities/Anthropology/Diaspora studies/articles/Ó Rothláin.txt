  Ó Rothláin (/oʊ ˈroʊlɔːn/ oh-ROH-lawn) is an Irish name meaning "descendant of Rothlán". It is the pre-anglicised, Irish form of the names Rowlan, Rowland, Rowlands, Rollan, Rollin, Rolan and Rowley.  The name can also be found spelled as Ó Rothlán, Ó Rothlain, O'Rothlain, Rothlán, and Rothlan.    The name Ó Rothláin is an Irish surname. It is strongly linked with County Mayo, Connacht.  According to Irish History the family were chieftains within Co. Mayo (titled as "Taoiseach").    Ó Rothláin is recorded in The Tribes, Customs and Genealogies of the Hy Fiachrach by John O'Donovan.  The earliest reference is found in Irish Annals dating back to 1208.  According to the Annals of the Four Masters, Auliffe O'Rothlain, Chief of Calry of Coolcarney, was slain by O'Moran.   The next major mention of the name Ó Rothláin appears in the year 1337 in the Annals of Connacht (Annála Connacht),1337.9, stating that, "Master Ó Rothlain rested in Christ."  This same event again appears in the Annals of the Four Masters, M1337.3, "The Master Professor Ó Rothlain died."

The family may have been exiled or fled from Ulster for being Catholic in connection with the 1795 Battle of the Diamond.   Approximately 4,000 Ulster Catholics fled into County Mayo (see Crossmolina) after their defeat.  This theory states that the family settled in and around the town of Castlebar where they can still be found bearing the name of Rowland.  However, while some Ulster Catholics may have married into the family or clan, this theory is doubted as the families presence in Connacht pre-date 1795 by nearly 600 years.
