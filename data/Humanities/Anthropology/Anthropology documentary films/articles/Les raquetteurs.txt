Les raquetteurs is a 1958 Direct Cinema documentary film co-directed by Michel Brault and Gilles Groulx. The film explores life in rural Quebec, at a convention of snowshoers in Sherbrooke, Quebec in February  1958. The film is notable for helping to establish the then-nascent French language  production unit at the National Film Board of Canada, and  more importantly, the development of a uniquely Quebec style of direct  cinema.  The film incorporates agile camera work and a largely synchronous soundtrack, uninterrupted by any narration, in keeping with the ethos of direct cinema to avoid any imposed "truth" on events onscreen.  Grant McLean, then head of production for the NFB, had been angry that what was to have been a three-minute vignette had quadrupled in length and ordered the film to be used for stock footage. However, NFB producers Tom Daly and Guy Glover interceded on the young  filmmakers' behalf.  At the time of its release, Les raquetteurs raised some concerns about its  "nonofficial" style, and ruffled some feathers in Quebec for its portrayal of rural Quebecers.
