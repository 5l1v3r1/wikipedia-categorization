  St Kilda, Britain's Loneliest Isle is a short, silent film about St Kilda (an archipelago to the west of Scotland) and the final period of its habitation. In the 1920s, the steamship company running a service between Glasgow and St Kilda commissioned the 18 minute silent movie, directed by Paul Robello and Bobbie Mann. It was released in 1928 and shows some scenes in the lives of the islandâ€™s inhabitants.  In May 2010, the film was inscribed in UNESCO's UK Memory of the World Register.
