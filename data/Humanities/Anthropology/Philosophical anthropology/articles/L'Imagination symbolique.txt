L'Imagination symbolique (literally The Symbolic Imagination) is a philosophical anthropology book from French anthropologist Gilbert Durand. The first edition was issued in 1964. Durand reprises his influential concept of the anthropological trajectory, and he proposed a "tactical pedagody of the imaginary."  Some passages from the essay are revisited version of Dudans's 1954 publication in SUP.: Initiation philosophique.  Among the differences, the change in terminology from "cultures apolliniennes" to "régime diurne," and from "cultures dionysiennes" to "régime nocturne"; the earlier terminology followed that of Ruth Benedict and Nietzsche, while the new terminology follows what Durand formulated in 1960 with The Anthropological Structures of the Imaginary.
