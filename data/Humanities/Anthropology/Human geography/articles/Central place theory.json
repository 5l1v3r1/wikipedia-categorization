In the functional hierarchies, generalizations can be made regarding the spacing, size and function of settlements.\n</p>\n<ol><li>The larger the settlements are in size, the fewer in number they will be, i.e. there are many small villages, but few large cities.</li>\n<li>The larger the settlements grow in size, the greater the distance between them, i.e. villages are usually found close together, while cities are spaced much further apart.</li>\n<li>As a settlement increases in size, the range and number of its functions will increase .</li>\n<li>As a settlement increases in size, the number of higher-order services will also increase, i.e. a greater degree of specialization occurs in the services.</li></ol>\n<p>The higher the order of the goods and services (more durable,Heidi valuable and variable), the larger the range of the goods and services, the longer the distance people are willing to travel to acquire them.\n</p><p>At the base of the hierarchy pyramid are shopping centres, newsagents etc. which sell low order goods.

Furthermore, the theory holds up well when it comes to agricultural areas, but not industrial or postindustrial areas due to their diversified nature of various services or their varied distribution of natural resources.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Newer_developments:_a_dynamic_concept_for_CPT\">Newer developments: a dynamic concept for CPT</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Central_place_theory&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: Newer developments: a dynamic concept for CPT\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Newer theoretical developments have shown that it is possible to overcome the static aspect of CPT. Veneris (1984) developed a theoretical model which starts with (a) a system of evenly distributed (\"medieval\") towns; (b) new economic activities are located in some towns thus causing differentiation and evolution into an hierarchical (\"industrial\") city system; (c) further differentiation leads into a post-hierarchical (\"postindustrial\") city system.\nThis evolution can be modelled by means of the three major CPT theories: stage (a) is a system of von Thunen \"isolated states\"; stage (b) is a Christallerian hierarchical system; stage (c) is a L\u00f6schian post-hierarchical system. Furthermore, stage (b) corresponds to <a href=\"/wiki/Christopher_Alexander\" title=\"Christopher Alexander\">Christopher Alexander</a>'s \"tree\" city, while (c) is similar to his \"lattice\" system (following his dictum \"the city is not a tree\").\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_importance_of_a_City_and_other_Theoretical_Considerations\">The importance of a City and other Theoretical Considerations</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Central_place_theory&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10\" title=\"Edit section: The importance of a City and other Theoretical Considerations\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>According to Smith, Walter Christaller erred in his development of CPT in 1930 by using size of population and number of telephones in determining the importance of a city.  Smith recognized that although population size was important to the area served by a city, the <b>number of kinds of services</b> offered there was more important as a measure of the importance of a city in attracting consumers.  In applying CPT to describe the delivery of medical care in California, Smith counted the number of physician specialties to determine the importance of a city in the delivery of medical care.\n</p><p>Christaller also erred in the assumption that cities \"emerge\".  In California and much of the United States, many cities were situated by the railroads at the time the tracks were laid.  In California, towns founded by the railroads were 12 miles apart, the amount of track a section crew could maintain in the 1850s; larger towns were 60 miles apart, the distance a steam engine could travel before needing water.  Older towns were founded a day's horse ride apart by the Spanish priests who founded early missions.\n</p><p>In medical care regions described by Smith, there is a hierarchy of services, with primary care ideally distributed throughout an area, middle sized cities offering secondary care, and metropolitan areas with tertiary care.  Income, size of population, population demographics, distance to the next service center, all had an influence on the number and kind of specialists located in a population center. (Smith, 1977, 1979)\n</p><p>For example, orthopedic surgeons are found in ski areas, obstetricians in the suburbs, and boutique specialties such as hypnosis, plastic surgery, psychiatry are more likely to be found in high income areas. It was possible to estimate the size of population (threshold) needed to support a specialty, and also to link specialties that needed to cooperate and locate near each other, such as hematology, oncology, and pathology, or cardiology, thoracic surgery and pulmonology.\n</p><p>Her work is important for the study of physician location\u2014where physicians choose to practice and where their practices will have a sufficient population size to support them. The income level of the population determines whether sufficient physicians will practice in an area and whether public subsidy is needed to maintain the health of the population.\n</p><p>The distribution of medical care in California followed patterns having to do with the settlement of cities.  Cities and their hinterlands having characteristics of the Traffic Principle (See K=4 above) usually have six thoroughfares through them\u2014the thoroughfares including highways, rivers, railroads, and canals.  They are most efficient and can deliver the lowest cost services because transportation is cheaper.  Those having settled on the market principle (K=3 above) have more expensive services and goods, as they were founded at times when transportation was more primitive.  In Appalachia, for example, the market principle still prevails and rural medical care is much more expensive.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Making_Central_Place_Theory_operational\">Making Central Place Theory operational</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Central_place_theory&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11\" title=\"Edit section: Making Central Place Theory operational\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>CPT is often criticized as being \"unrealistic\". However, several studies show that it can describe existing urban systems.  An important issue is that Christaller's original formulation is incorrect in several ways (Smith). These errors become apparent if we try to make CPT \"operational\", that is if we try to derive numerical data out of the theoretical schemata. These problems have been identified for by Veneris (1984) and subsequently by Openshaw and Veneris (2003), who provided also theoretically sound and consistent solutions, based on a K=3, 37-centre CP system:\n</p><p>1. Closure problem. Christaller's original scheme implies an infinite landscape. Although each market has finite size, the total system has no boundaries to it. Neither Christaller, nor the early related literature provide any guidance as to how the system can be \"contained\". Openshaw and Veneris (2003) identified three different types of closure, namely (a) isolated state, (b) territorial closure and (c) functional closure. Each closure type implies different population patterns.\n</p><p>2. Generating trips. Following the basic Christallerian logic and the closure types identified, Openshaw and Veneris (2003) calculate trip patterns between the 27 centres.\n</p><p>3. Calculating inter- and intra-zonal costs/distances. Christaller assumed freedom of movement in all directions, which would imply \"airline\" distances between centres. At the same time, he provided specific road networks for the CP system, which do not allow for airline distances. This is a major flaw which neither Christaller, nor early related literature have identified.  Openshaw and Veneris (2003) calculate costs/distances which are consistent with the Christallerian principles.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Central_Place_Theory_and_Spatial_Interaction_Models\">Central Place Theory and Spatial Interaction Models</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Central_place_theory&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12\" title=\"Edit section: Central Place Theory and Spatial Interaction Models\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Further information: <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Spatial_Interaction_Models&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Spatial Interaction Models (page does not exist)\">Spatial Interaction Models</a></div>\n<p>It was once thought that central place theory is not compatible with spatial interaction models (SIM). It is paradoxical however that some times towns or shopping centres are planned with CPT, and subsequently evaluated with SIM.\n</p><p>Openshaw and Veneris (2003) succeeded in linking these two major regional theories in a clear and theoretically consistent way: using the data they derived from the operationalization of CPT, they experimented with several SIM. Following a thorough investigation via computer simulation, they reached important theoretical and practical conclusions.\n</p><p>Smith was able to delineate medical care regions (the range), describe the hierarchy of medical services, the population base required of each medical specialty (threshold), the efficiency of regions, and the importance of how an area was settled to the delivery of medical care, that is, according to traffic, market or administrative principles.
