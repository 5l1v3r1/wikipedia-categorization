The list of uninhabited regions includes a number of places around the globe. The list changes year over year as human beings migrate into formerly uninhabited regions, or migrate out of formerly inhabited regions. As a group, the list of uninhabited places are called the "nonecumene".  This is a special geography term which means the uninhabited area of the world.
