A line consisted of 2, 3 or 4 ranks of soldiers.\n</p><p>The relatively short range at which smoothbore muskets could hit a target (50-100 yards), added to the slow reload (2 to  3 rounds per minute)<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>, meant that massed formation firing was essential for maximizing shock by means of firing at the center of the opposing line. During the time period that line infantry were prevalent, the object was to cause the enemy formation to rout, which was done by breaking it, and thus plunging it into disarray. This is why they fired all at once, on command, rather than at will, even though it was less effective in causing actual casualties, as firing was done only as fast as the slowest man could reload his weapon. The line was considered as the fundamental battle formation as it allowed for the largest deployment of firepower. Troops in <a href=\"/wiki/Skirmish\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Skirmish\">skirmish</a> formation, though able to take cover and use initiative, were highly vulnerable to cavalry and could not hold ground against advancing infantry columns. Line infantry provided an 'anchor' for skirmishers and cavalry to retreat to if threatened.\n</p><p>Against surrounding enemy cavalry, line infantry could swiftly adopt <a href=\"/wiki/Infantry_square\" title=\"Infantry square\">square formations</a> to provide protection. Such squares were hollow (consisting of four lines), unlike the pikemen' and old-style musketeers' square.\n</p><p>Movement in <a href=\"/wiki/Line_(formation)\" title=\"Line (formation)\">line formation</a> was very slow, and unless the battalion was superbly trained, a breakdown in cohesion was virtually assured, especially in any kind of uneven or wooded terrain. As a result, line was mostly used as a stationary formation, with troops moving in <a href=\"/wiki/Column_(formation)\" title=\"Column (formation)\">column formations</a> and then deploying to line at their destination. Usually, columns would be adopted for movement and melee attacks.\n</p><p>Line infantry was trained in the <a href=\"/wiki/Manual_of_arms\" title=\"Manual of arms\">manual of arms</a> evolutions, the main objectives of which were fast deployment of a line, rapid shooting and manoeuvre.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Training_and_recruitment\">Training and recruitment</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Line_infantry&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Training and recruitment\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Line tactics required a strict discipline and simple movements, practiced to the point where they became second-nature. During training, the drill and corporal punishments were widely used.\n</p><p>Line infantry quickly became the most common type of infantry in European countries. <a href=\"/wiki/Musketeer\" title=\"Musketeer\">Musketeers</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Grenadier\" title=\"Grenadier\">grenadiers</a>, formerly <a href=\"/wiki/Special_forces#History\" title=\"Special forces\">elite troops</a>, gradually became part of the line infantry, switching to linear tactics.\n</p><p>Over time the use of line infantry tactics spread outside of Europe, often as a result of European imperialism. In European colonies and settlements with small populations from the home country, line infantry forces were often raised from the local population, with the British <a href=\"/wiki/East_India_Company\" title=\"East India Company\">East India Company</a>'s <a href=\"/wiki/Sepoys\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sepoys\">sepoys</a> perhaps being the most historically significant example.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Arms_and_equipment\">Arms and equipment</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Line_infantry&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Arms and equipment\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In the middle of the 17th century, the <a href=\"/wiki/Matchlock\" title=\"Matchlock\">matchlock</a> muskets of some line infantry were equipped with <a href=\"/wiki/Bayonet\" title=\"Bayonet\">bayonets</a>. Bayonets were attached to the muzzles of muskets and were used when line troops entered <a href=\"/wiki/Melee\" title=\"Melee\">melee</a> combat. They also helped to defend against cavalry.\n</p><p>At the end of the 17th century, <a href=\"/wiki/Matchlock\" title=\"Matchlock\">matchlock</a> however the matchlock muskets had a problem. Since the matchlock musket used a burning fire instead of sparks. The fire can accidentlly catch fire on the gun powder and bringing serious injuries to death. The matchlock muskets were replaced by lighter and cheaper infantry <a href=\"/wiki/Fusilier\" title=\"Fusilier\">fusils</a> with <a href=\"/wiki/Flintlock\" title=\"Flintlock\">flintlocks</a>, weighing 5&#160;kg with a caliber of 17.5&#160;mm, first in France and then in other states. In many countries, the new fusils retained the name \"musket\". Both muskets and fusils were <a href=\"/wiki/Smoothbore\" title=\"Smoothbore\">smoothbore</a>, which lessened their accuracy and range, but made for faster loading, lesser amount of bore fouling and more robust, less complicated firearms.\n</p><p>The bulk of the line infantry had no protective equipment, as armor that could provide protection from musket fire were considered too expensive and heavy. Only the former elite troops could keep by tradition some elements of protection, for example, the copper mitre caps of grenadiers.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Line_infantry_and_other_contemporary_types_of_infantry\">Line infantry and other contemporary types of infantry</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Line_infantry&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Line infantry and other contemporary types of infantry\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Initially, soldiers equipped with firearms formed only a small part of the infantry branch of most armies, because of their vulnerability to hostile cavalry. <a href=\"/wiki/Pikemen\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Pikemen\">Pikemen</a> formed the majority of infantrymen and were known as heavy infantry. A significant part of infantry consisted of old-style musketeers, who did not use the linear tactics, instead skirmishing in open formation. However, by the middle of the 17th century, musketeers deployed in line formation already provided about half of the foot troops in most Western European armies. <a href=\"/wiki/Maurice_of_Nassau\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Maurice of Nassau\">Maurice of Nassau</a> was noted as the first large scale user of linear tactic, introducing the 'counter-march' to enable his formations of musketeers to maintain a continuous fire. After the invention of the bayonet, musketeers could finally defend themselves from the enemy's horsemen, and the percentage of pikemen fell gradually. In 1699, the Austrian army got rid of their pikes. In 1703, the French army did the same, in 1704 the British and 1708 the Dutch. In 1699\u20131721, <a href=\"/wiki/Peter_the_Great\" title=\"Peter the Great\">Peter I</a> converted almost all Russian foot-regiments to line infantry. The abandonment of the pike, together with the faster firing rate made possible by the introduction of the new <a href=\"/wiki/Flintlock\" title=\"Flintlock\">flintlock</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Musket\" title=\"Musket\">musket</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Paper_cartridge\" title=\"Paper cartridge\">paper cartridge</a>, resulted in the abandonment of the deeper formations of troops more ideal for the melee-oriented pikemen. Instead, military thinking switched to shallower lines that maximized the firepower of an infantry formation.\n</p><p>Besides regular line infantry, there were elite troops (royal guards and other designated elite regiments) and the <a href=\"/wiki/Light_infantry#Modern_age\" title=\"Light infantry\">light infantry</a>. Light infantry operated in extended order (also known as skirmish formation) as opposed to the close order (tight formations) used by line infantry. Since the late 18th century, light infantry in most European countries mostly consisted of <a href=\"/wiki/Rifleman\" title=\"Rifleman\">riflemen</a> (such as the German <a href=\"/wiki/J%C3%A4ger_(military)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"J\u00e4ger (military)\">J\u00e4ger</a>), armed with rifled carbines and trained in aimed shooting and use of <a href=\"/wiki/Enfilade_and_defilade\" title=\"Enfilade and defilade\">defilades</a>. Line infantry, whose muskets with bayonets were heavier than carbines, became known as heavy infantry and were used as the main deciding force.\n</p><p>In France, during the <a href=\"/wiki/French_Revolutionary_Wars\" title=\"French Revolutionary Wars\">Revolutionary</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars\" title=\"Napoleonic Wars\">Napoleonic Wars</a>, the division into the Guard, while line infantry and light infantry formally continued to exist, line and \"light\" <a href=\"/wiki/Regiment\" title=\"Regiment\">regiments</a> had identical weaponry (smooth-bore fusils) and tactics. (Napoleon preferred smooth-bore weaponry for their faster reload speeds.) However, each battalion in both line and \"light\" regiments included a company of <a href=\"/wiki/Voltigeurs\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Voltigeurs\">voltigeurs</a>, who were expected to act as skirmishers as well being able to deploy into line.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The Russian infantry of 1854 comprised 108 regiments, of which 42 were line infantry. The remainder were specialized or elite units such as Guards, Grenadiers and J\u00e4gers.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> Only part of the Russian light infantry were equipped with the M1854 rifle, the remainder retaining smoothbore percussion muskets.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In the second half of the 19th century, the coming of <a href=\"/wiki/Mass_production\" title=\"Mass production\">mass production</a> and new technologies, such as the <a href=\"/wiki/Minie_ball\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Minie ball\">Minie ball</a>, allowed European armies to gradually equip all their infantrymen with <a href=\"/wiki/Rifled\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Rifled\">rifled</a> weapons, and the percentage of line infantry equipped with muskets fell. In the American Civil War, both Northern and Confederate armies had only a few <a href=\"/wiki/Line_regiment\" title=\"Line regiment\">line regiments</a> equipped with the old-style smooth-bore muskets. However, France, due to Napoleon III, who admired Napoleon I, had 300 line battalions (comprising an overwhelming majority) even in 1870. Although the French line infantry received Chassepot rifles in 1866, it was still being trained in the use of close formations (line, column and square), which was changed only after the dethronement of Napoleon III. This was common practice in all conventional Western armies until the late 19th century, as infantry tactics and military thinking had yet to catch up with the new technological development.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Battlefield_obsolescence\">Battlefield obsolescence</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Line_infantry&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Battlefield obsolescence\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In the years after the Napoleonic Wars, line infantry continued to be deployed as the main battle force, while light infantry provided fire support and covered the movement of units. In Russia, Great Britain, France, Prussia and some other states, linear tactics and formation discipline were maintained into the late 19th century.\n</p><p>With the invention of new weaponry, the concept of line infantry began to wane. The <a href=\"/wiki/Mini%C3%A9_ball\" title=\"Mini\u00e9 ball\">Mini\u00e9 ball</a> (an improved rifle ammunition), allowed individual infantrymen to shoot more accurately and over greatly increased range. Men walking in formation line-abreast became easy targets, as evidenced in the <a href=\"/wiki/American_Civil_War\" title=\"American Civil War\">American Civil War</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> The <a href=\"/wiki/Austro-Prussian_War\" title=\"Austro-Prussian War\">Austro-Prussian War</a> in 1866 showed that <a href=\"/wiki/Breech-loading_weapon\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Breech-loading weapon\">breech-loading rifles</a>, which gave the individual shooter a greatly increased rate of fire, were greatly superior to muzzleloaded rifles. In the 1860s, most German states and Russia converted their line infantry and riflemen into 'united' infantry, which used rifles and skirmish tactics. After the Franco-Prussian War, both the <a href=\"/wiki/German_Empire\" title=\"German Empire\">German Empire</a> and the <a href=\"/wiki/French_Third_Republic\" title=\"French Third Republic\">French Third Republic</a> did the same. However, Great Britain retained the name \"line infantry\", although it used rifled muskets from 1853, breech loading rifles from 1867, and switched from closed lines to extended order during Boer wars.\n</p><p>The growing accuracy and rate of fire of rifles, together with the invention of the <a href=\"/wiki/Maxim_gun\" title=\"Maxim gun\">Maxim</a> machine gun in 1883, meant that close order line infantry would suffer huge losses before being able to close with their foe, while the defensive advantages given to line infantry against cavalry became irrelevant with the effective removal of offensive <a href=\"/wiki/Cavalry\" title=\"Cavalry\">cavalry</a> from the battlefield in the face of the improved weaponry. With the turn of the 20th Century, this slowly led to infantry increasingly adopting <a href=\"/wiki/Skirmish\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Skirmish\">skirmish</a> style <a href=\"/wiki/Light_infantry\" title=\"Light infantry\">light infantry</a> tactics in battle, while retaining line infantry drill for training.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Retention_of_.22line_infantry.22_title\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Retention_of_&quot;line_infantry&quot;_title\">Retention of \"line infantry\" title</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Line_infantry&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Retention of &quot;line infantry&quot; title\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>While, as detailed above, linear battle tactics had become obsolete by the second half of the nineteenth century, regiments in a number of European armies continued to be classified as \"line infantry\" (or cavalry). This designation had come to mean the regular or numbered regiments of an army, as opposed to specialist or elite formations. Accordingly, the distinction had become one of traditional title or classification without significance in respect of armament or tactics. As an example, the \n<a href=\"/wiki/Belgian_Army_order_of_battle_(1914)\" title=\"Belgian Army order of battle (1914)\">Belgian Army of 1914</a> comprised 14 regiments of <i>Infanterie de Ligne</i> (line infantry), three of <i>Chasseurs a pied</i> (light infantry), one of <i>Grenadiers</i> and one of <i>Carabiniers</i>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> Similar differentiations were made in the majority of European armies of the period, although English-speaking authors sometimes use the designation \"line infantry\" when referring to the ordinary infantry of some other countries where the exact term was not in use.\n</p><p>The term was also used by US units during the Second World War, as shown by this quote from a report of the <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=782nd_Tank_Battalion&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"782nd Tank Battalion (page does not exist)\">782nd Tank Battalion</a> in late April 1945:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nOn the 22nd of April, the Battalion moved from Oberkotzau, Germany to <a href=\"/wiki/Wunsiedel\" title=\"Wunsiedel\">Wunsiedel</a>, Germany.
