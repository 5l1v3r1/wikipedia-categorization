Sophus Thalbitzer (1871â€“1941) was a Danish psychiatrist and medical doctor specializing in manic depressive psychoses. He successfully influenced Danish legislation on homosexuality towards decriminalization in 1933.  Although Thalbitzer never married in his life, there are no sources to support the hypotheses that he was homosexual or bisexual. In 1912 Thalbitzer became consultant at the St Hans Women's Hospital near Copenhagen. In 1923 Thalbitzer became a member of the Advisory Board of Directors of the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee. In 1924 and 1925 he published two articles on homosexuality, successfully influencing Danish criminal legislation with his 'scientific' defence of the lowering of homosexual age of consent from 21 to 18.
