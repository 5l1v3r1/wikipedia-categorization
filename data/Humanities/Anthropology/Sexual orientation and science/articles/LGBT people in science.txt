LGBT people in science are students, professionals, hobbyists, and anyone else who is LGBT and interested in science. There are traditions and expectations that LGBT people should not study or have careers in science.  In 2016 the American Physical Society published a list of ways in which LGBT scientists have a more difficult career experience than their non-LGBT counterparts.  Some activists have speculated on whether the visibility of more LGBT role models in science would make it easier for other LGBT students to join the sciences.  A report on a 2015 survey of United States undergraduate students found that gay students of science were more likely to change their major to a subject outside of science than non-LGBT students.  Some academic commentators who study LGBT issues commented that LGBT students face social barriers to studying science which non-LGBT people do not experience.  Various activist organizations used this study as supporting evidence that social changes could bring equal opportunity for LGBT people to study and have careers in science.  In recognition that LGBT people are underrepresented in the sciences, various universities have programs to encourage more LGBT students to join their science programs.
