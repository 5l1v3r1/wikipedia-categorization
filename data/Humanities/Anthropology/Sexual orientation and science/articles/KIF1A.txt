KIF1A is a member of the kinesin family. This protein is highly similar to mouse heavy-chain kinesin member 1A protein, which is an anterograde motor protein that transports membranous organelles along axonal microtubules. It is thought that this protein may play a critical role in the development of axonal neuropathies resulting from impaired axonal transport. There are multiple polyadenylation sites found in this gene.  Sexual orientation has been linked to the regulatory domain of the gene.  KIF1A is associated with hereditary spastic paraparesis.
