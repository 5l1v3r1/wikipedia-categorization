In 2009 it created a program for Culture, Brain, Development, and Mental Health (CBDMH). The primary objective of CBDMH, which is co-directed by psychological anthropologist <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.anthro.ucla.edu/people/faculty?lid=340\">Doug Hollan</a> of UCLA and cultural psychologist <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://dornsife.usc.edu/labs/culture-and-mental-health/home/\">Steve L\u00f3pez</a> of USC, is to establish a strong program in <a href=\"/wiki/Cultural_psychiatry\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cultural psychiatry\">cultural psychiatry</a>, with an emphasis on integrating neuroscience and social science perspectives. The research initiative is based around ongoing, sustainable field sites and programs in various locations across the globe. A training component is embedded within each of the ongoing research projects.\n</p><p>In addition, through a series of workshops and conferences, the FPR brings together scholars, researchers, and clinicians with overlapping interests to think across disciplinary boundaries in order to address social issues of fundamental concern.\n</p><p>Participants from these meetings have contributed papers to two integrative volumes in the fields of <a href=\"/wiki/Developmental_psychobiology\" title=\"Developmental psychobiology\">developmental psychobiology</a>, cultural and biological <a href=\"/wiki/Anthropology\" title=\"Anthropology\">anthropology</a>, and the study of <a href=\"/wiki/Psychological_trauma\" title=\"Psychological trauma\">psychological trauma</a>: <i>Understanding Trauma: Integrating Biological, Clinical, and Cultural Perspectives</i> (Cambridge University Press, 2007), edited by cultural psychiatrist Laurence Kirmayer (<a href=\"/wiki/McGill_University\" title=\"McGill University\">McGill University</a>), Robert Lemelson, and physician/neuroscientist Mark Barad (UCLA), and <i>Formative Experiences: The Interaction of Caregiving, Culture, and Developmental Psychobiology</i> (Cambridge University Press, 2010), edited by biocultural anthropologist Carol M.

Exploring  the human genome and its epigenetic states, the biological roots of human sociality, and the mutual constitution of cultures and selves, as well as the complex interactions between the physical, cultural, and social environments underlying health and illness, with the goal to create models that integrate theory and method across these fields. The fifth FPR conference, Culture, Mind, and Brain: Emerging Concepts, Methods, Applications, took place at UCLA in October 2012. The two-day conference was organized with the support of the <a href=\"/wiki/Cultural_neuroscience\" title=\"Cultural neuroscience\">International Cultural Neuroscience Consortium</a>.\n</p><p>The aim was to highlight emerging concepts, methodologies and applications in the study of culture, mind, and brain, with particular attention to: (1)  neuroscience research that  incorporates culture and the social world; (2) the context in which methods are used as well as the tacit assumptions that shape research questions; and (3) the kinds and quality of collaborations that  advance interdisciplinary research training. The meeting was attended by  biologists, neuroscientists, psychologists, anthropologists, sociologists, epidemiologists, and those in related fields interested in learning about <a href=\"/wiki/Mixed_methods_research\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Mixed methods research\">mixed-methods</a> research at the intersection of culture, mind, and brain.

This conference occurred at a critical juncture in sex/gender research in neuroscience, anthropology, psychology, and related disciplines. New theories are utilizing a conception of the brain as dynamic, plastic, and adaptable,  and of sex/gender brain and behavioral differences as subject to the influence of a broad range of biological, cultural, and social or environmental factors. In organizing this conference, the aim was to bring the neuro- and social sciences together to consider three cross-cutting questions on sex/gender: why now? what\u2019s fixed/changing/changeable? what\u2019s at stake?\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a
