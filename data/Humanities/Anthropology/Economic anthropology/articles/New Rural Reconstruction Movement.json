While most of the NRR school rarely use the term \"<a href=\"/wiki/Chinese_New_Left\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Chinese New Left\">New Left</a>\" to describe themselves, they are generally considered to be an important part of that critical tradition. Like the <a href=\"/wiki/Chinese_New_Left\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Chinese New Left\">Chinese New Left</a> in general, the NRR school is critical of the dominant current of utopian marketization, in which the market is seen as a solution to all problems. Instead, NRR supports the creation of rural cooperatives and other forms of cooperative social organization.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>NRR grew out of a loosely parallel set of academics, students, state development workers, and grassroots activists. In the early 1990s, a debate grew up over <a href=\"/wiki/Neo-liberal\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Neo-liberal\">neo-liberal</a> policies, such as those advocated by the <a href=\"/wiki/World_Bank\" title=\"World Bank\">World Bank</a>. These critics charged that the success of free market and globalization policies in the short term threatened the long term viability of China's farm families and villages by eroding the remnants of the Mao-era <a href=\"/wiki/People%27s_commune\" title=\"People&#39;s commune\">communes</a>, which had provided health, education, and welfare, leaving individual families to fend for themselves in these areas. In addition, urban expansion drove up land prices and local officials confiscated land in order to build factories and housing for the newly affluent. By the middle of the 1990s, in addition to demonstrations against traditional targets such as taxes, there were widespread protests against the corruption of local officials, pollution from the factories (many of which were owned by outside interests), and the gap between the newly rich and the still poor rural areas.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In the late 1980s, <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Wen_Tiejun&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Wen Tiejun (page does not exist)\">Wen Tiejun</a> (then state development worker, now dean of the School of Agricultural Economics and Rural Development at <a href=\"/wiki/Renmin_University\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Renmin University\">Renmin University</a>) began to theorize and popularize the phrase \"sannong wenti\" (<a href=\"/wiki/Three_Rural_Issues\" title=\"Three Rural Issues\">three rural problems</a>), that is, nongmin (rural people or peasants), nongcun (rural society or villages), and nongye (rural production or agriculture). According to Wen's theory, Mao-era policies such as economic independence from the world capitalist system had been necessary for China to industrialize, but these policies had left the rural population in a weak position. The breakup of the <a href=\"/wiki/People%27s_commune\" title=\"People&#39;s commune\">commune</a> system had produced individual plots too small to use technology efficiently and farmers were now at the mercy of market forces and an economic policy which favored exports and the cities over the countryside. To solve these contradictions, further market reforms were not the right strategy. Rural life had to be reconstructed.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Wen Tiejun\u2019s influential essay \u201cDeconstructing Modernization\u201d challenged the West\u2019s industry-based modernization as an \u201cunreproducible experiment.\u201d The West, charged Wen, financed its development with capital from colonies and by controlling global resources, a strategy which was not open to China. Wen\u2019s research and travels in developing countries convinced him that China was not alone in facing \u201cthree disparities,\u201d that is, in rich vs. poor, city vs. countryside, and region vs. region. Wen hoped China\u2019s \u201cpeople-centered scientific approach\u201d and sustainable development would replace the earlier \u201cvulgar growth\u201d and \u201cblind advocacy of consumerism.\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Although NRR is mainly conceived as a distinctively Chinese response to the problems of modernization under particular historical conditions, experiences outside of China have also influenced NRR. Negatively, the NRR school aims to avoid the social problems many developing countries have faced due to market-centered development and rapid urbanization - especially rural landlessness, the formation of large sub-proletarian slums, and social unrest. Positively, some members of the NRR school looks to positive lessons from other developing countries that have mitigated these trends through various \"alternative development\" experiences. Most commonly discussed of these lessons is that of <a href=\"/wiki/Kerala\" title=\"Kerala\">Kerala</a>, India (see the <a href=\"/wiki/Kerala_model\" title=\"Kerala model\">Kerala model</a>). Mainland Chinese NRR advocates learned about Kerala and other foreign experiences mainly through the introduction of Hong Kong scholars and activists, especially <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Lau_Kin_Chi&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Lau Kin Chi (page does not exist)\">Lau Kin Chi</a> and ARENA (<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.arenaonline.org/\">Asian Regional Exchange for New Alternatives</a>). In 2001, Lau arranged for Wen Tiejun and other mainland activists to visit the <a href=\"/wiki/Kerala_Sasthra_Sahithya_Parishad\" title=\"Kerala Sasthra Sahithya Parishad\">People's Science Movement</a> in Kerala. This movement, they found, took inspiration not only from <a href=\"/wiki/Gandhi\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Gandhi\">Gandhi</a> but also from <a href=\"/wiki/Mao_Zedong\" title=\"Mao Zedong\">Mao Zedong</a>. Kerala\u2019s high life expectancy, literacy, and social equality came not only from party politics and government policies, but also from such popular movements and the mobilization of many trained organizers working from the bottom up and organizing on a community level.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"History\">History</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=New_Rural_Reconstruction_Movement&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: History\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Around 2002, some Chinese advocates of rural cooperative experimentation began adopting the term \"Rural Reconstruction\" from China's 1920s-1930s <a href=\"/wiki/Rural_Reconstruction_Movement\" title=\"Rural Reconstruction Movement\">Rural Reconstruction Movement</a>. The term \"NRR\" was first publicly used in January 2003, when CSER (<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.cser.org.cn/\">China Society of Economic Reform</a>, the think-tank/ publishing house where Wen Tiejun was based at the time) sponsored a national workshop on NRR in Beijing, attended by dozens of grassroots activists as well as supporters from Hong Kong. In July 2003, grassroots activist <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Qiu_Jiansheng&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Qiu Jiansheng (page does not exist)\">Qiu Jiansheng</a> founded the James Yen Institute for Rural Reconstruction near the site of <a href=\"/wiki/Y._C._James_Yen\" title=\"Y. C. James Yen\">James Yen</a>'s 1930s Rural Reconstruction center in <a href=\"/wiki/Dingzhou\" title=\"Dingzhou\">Dingzhou</a>, along with the support of the local government, CSER, and Lau Kin Chi's <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.csd.org.hk/\">China Social Services and Development Research Centre</a>. This became one of two national centers for NRR activities - mainly training student volunteers and grassroots activists on how to set up, run and support projects such as cooperatives - until it closed in 2007. In 2004 the other, still active national center - the <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.3nong.org/\">Liang Shuming Center for Rural Reconstruction</a> - was founded in Beijing by grassroots activist <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Liu_Xiangbo&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Liu Xiangbo (page does not exist)\">Liu Xiangbo</a>, also with the support of Wen Tiejun. After Wen left CSER and founded the Rural Reconstruction Center at <a href=\"/wiki/Renmin_University\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Renmin University\">Renmin University</a> in 2005, the latter replaced CSER as an important institutional and economic base for the Liang Shuming Center and other NRR organizations and activities, such as the <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_504b34620100894v.html\">Guoren Green Alliance</a> (a marketing network for environmentally-friendly farming cooperatives) and the <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_55a11f8e0100dfpd.html\">Little Donkey Farm</a> (one of China's first experiments with <a href=\"/wiki/Community_supported_agriculture\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Community supported agriculture\">community supported agriculture</a>).\n</p><p>Other academic institutions, such as the <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://soci.hust.edu.cn/ReadNews.asp?NewsID=806\">Center for Rural Governance Studies</a> at <a href=\"/wiki/Huazhong_University_of_Science_and_Technology\" title=\"Huazhong University of Science and Technology\">Huazhong University of Science and Technology</a>, and other NGOs and networks, such as the <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://gacrg.org/\">Guizhou Association for Community Building and Rural Governance</a>, identify with NRR, although some emphasize their differences from the current of NRR centered on Wen Tiejun and the Liang Shuming Center. Others, and an uncertain but certainly large number of grassroots experiments, have been influenced by NRR without using this term. To complicate matters, since the Chinese government began promoting the policy of \u201cConstructing a New Socialist Countryside\u201d (NSC, <a href=\"/wiki/Chinese_language\" title=\"Chinese language\">Chinese</a>&#58; <span lang=\"zh\">\u5efa\u8bbe\u793e\u4f1a\u4e3b\u4e49\u65b0\u519c\u6751</span>; <a href=\"/wiki/Pinyin\" title=\"Pinyin\">pinyin</a>&#58; <i><span lang=\"zh-Latn-pinyin\">jianshe shehuizhuyi xin nongcun</span></i>) in 2006, many NRR advocates made a subtle switch to the state's term \"NSC\" instead of \"NRR,\" presenting their views and experiments as \"peasant-centered\" or \"village-community-centered\" approaches to NSC. (While this new <a href=\"/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Party\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Chinese Communist Party\">CCP</a> policy is influenced in part by NRR, it should be primarily understood as an attempt to build the conditions for developing the rural consumer market.)<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Present_Situation\">Present Situation</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=New_Rural_Reconstruction_Movement&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Present Situation\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>After 2006, therefore, it became more difficult to identify a coherent NRR current or movement because, (1) the original NRR advocates generally stopped using the term, (2) some NRR advocates emphasized their differences from other NRR advocates, and (3) many more activists and experiments were (and continue to be) influenced by one or another strand of NRR without using or even necessarily knowing this term.
