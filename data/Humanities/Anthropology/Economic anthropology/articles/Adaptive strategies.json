{"parse":{"title":"Adaptive strategies","pageid":3365136,"revid":713184096,"text":{"*":"<div class=\"mw-parser-output\"><p>The expression <i><b>adaptive strategies</b></i> is used by <a href=\"/wiki/Anthropologist\" title=\"Anthropologist\">anthropologist</a> <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Yehudi_Cohen&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Yehudi Cohen (page does not exist)\">Yehudi Cohen</a> to describe a society\u2019s system of <a href=\"/wiki/Economic_production\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Economic production\">economic production</a>.  Cohen argued that the most important reason for similarities between two (or more) unrelated societies is their possession of a similar adaptive strategy.  In other words, similar economic causes have similar sociocultural effects.\n</p><p>For example, there are clear similarities among societies that have a foraging (hunting and gathering) strategy.  Cohen developed a typology of societies based on correlations between their economies and their social features.  His typology includes these five adaptive strategies: <a href=\"/wiki/Foraging\" title=\"Foraging\">foraging</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Horticulture\" title=\"Horticulture\">horticulture</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Agriculture\" title=\"Agriculture\">agriculture</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Pastoralism\" title=\"Pastoralism\">pastoralism</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Industrialism\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Industrialism\">industrialism</a>.\n</p><p>Until 10,000 years ago people everywhere were foragers.  However, <a href=\"/wiki/Ecosystem\" title=\"Ecosystem\">environmental</a> differences did create contrasts among the world\u2019s foragers.  Some, like the people who lived in <a href=\"/wiki/Europe\" title=\"Europe\">Europe</a> during the ice ages, were big game hunters.  Today, hunters in the <a href=\"/wiki/Arctic\" title=\"Arctic\">Arctic</a> still focus on large animals and herd animals; they have much less <a href=\"/wiki/Vegetation\" title=\"Vegetation\">vegetation</a> and variety in their diets than do tropical foragers.  The foraging way of life held on in certain <a href=\"/wiki/Forest\" title=\"Forest\">forests</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Desert\" title=\"Desert\">deserts</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Island\" title=\"Island\">islands</a>, and very cold areas\u2013-places where food production was not practicable with simple <a href=\"/wiki/Technology\" title=\"Technology\">technology</a>.\n</p><p>Horticulture and agriculture are the two types of cultivation found in nonindustrial societies.  Both differ from the farming systems of industrial nations like the <a href=\"/wiki/United_States\" title=\"United States\">United States</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Canada\" title=\"Canada\">Canada</a>, which use large land areas, machinery, and <a href=\"/wiki/Petrochemical\" title=\"Petrochemical\">petrochemicals</a>.  According to Cohen, horticulture is cultivation that does not make any intensive use of the usual factors of production: land, labor, capital, and machinery.  Agriculture is a type of cultivation that requires more labor than horticulture does, because it uses land intensively and continuously.  The greater labor demands associated with agriculture reflect its use of domesticated animals, <a href=\"/wiki/Irrigation\" title=\"Irrigation\">irrigation</a>, and/or terracing.\n</p><p>Pastoralists live in <a href=\"/wiki/North_Africa\" title=\"North Africa\">North Africa</a>, the <a href=\"/wiki/Middle_East\" title=\"Middle East\">Middle East</a>, Europe, <a href=\"/wiki/Asia\" title=\"Asia\">Asia</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Sub-Saharan_Africa\" title=\"Sub-Saharan Africa\">sub-Saharan Africa</a>.  These herders are people whose activities focus on such domesticated animals such as <a href=\"/wiki/Cattle\" title=\"Cattle\">cattle</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Sheep\" title=\"Sheep\">sheep</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Goat\" title=\"Goat\">goats</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Camel\" title=\"Camel\">camels</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Yak\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Yak\">yak</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Reindeer\" title=\"Reindeer\">reindeer</a>.  Industrialization is the transformation of \u201ctraditional\u201d into \u201cmodern\u201d societies through industrialization of the economy.  Wealthy people sought investment opportunities and eventually found them in machines and engines to drive machines.  Industrialization increased production in both farming and manufacturing.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sources\">Sources</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Adaptive_strategies&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Sources\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li>Conrad Philip Kottak, \"Windows on Humanity\"</li></ul>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw1287\nCached time: 20180907033053\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.012 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.016 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 33/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 0/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:3365136-0!canonical and timestamp 20180907033053 and revision id 713184096\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","*":"Economic_anthropology"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Agriculture"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Anthropologist"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Arctic"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Asia"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Camel"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Canada"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Cattle"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Desert"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Economic production"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Ecosystem"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Europe"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Foraging"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Forest"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Goat"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Horticulture"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Industrialism"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Irrigation"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Island"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Middle East"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"North Africa"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Pastoralism"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Petrochemical"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Reindeer"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Sheep"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Technology"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"United States"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Vegetation"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Yak"},{"ns":0,"*":"Yehudi Cohen"}],"templates":[],"images":[],"externallinks":[],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Sources","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Adaptive_strategies","byteoffset":2628,"anchor":"Sources"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Adaptive strategies","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q4680768"}]}}
