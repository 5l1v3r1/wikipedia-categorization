Some of these impacts continue into the present.  The primary differences of the Jim Crow economy, compared to a situation like <a href=\"/wiki/Crime_of_apartheid\" title=\"Crime of apartheid\"><i>apartheid</i></a>, revolve around the alleged equality of access, especially in regard to land ownership and entry into the competitive labor market; however, those two categories often relate to ancillary effects in all other aspects of life.\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Introduction\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Introduction</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Usage\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Usage</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Land\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Land</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Rural\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Rural</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Urban\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Urban</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#Labor\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Labor</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#Demographics\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Demographics</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#Rural_labor\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Rural labor</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-9\"><a href=\"#Labor_laws\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Labor laws</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-10\"><a href=\"#Urban_labor\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Urban labor</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-11\"><a href=\"#Life_and_death\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Life and death</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-12\"><a href=\"#Legacy\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Legacy</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-13\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">7</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Introduction\">Introduction</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Jim_Crow_economy&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Introduction\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>During the decade following the <a href=\"/wiki/American_Civil_War\" title=\"American Civil War\">Civil War</a>, the freed slaves made gains in political participation, land ownership, and personal wealth; but, those gains were somewhat temporary, perhaps because the mood of the federal policy-makers changed from punishing <a href=\"/wiki/Secession_in_the_United_States\" title=\"Secession in the United States\">secessionists</a>, to repatriating them.  In the decades following the closure of the <a href=\"/wiki/Freedmen%27s_Bureau\" title=\"Freedmen&#39;s Bureau\">Freedmen's Bureau</a>, in the South, black political participation was curtailed, the potential for acquiring new land was diminished, and ultimately <i><a href=\"/wiki/Plessy_v._Ferguson\" title=\"Plessy v. Ferguson\">Plessy v. Ferguson</a></i> would usher in the Jim Crow era.\n</p><p>By the end of the first decade of the 20th century, not only was <a href=\"/wiki/African_American\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"African American\">African American</a> progress halted, it was regressing.  Leading up to and following World War I, the agrarian economy of the South was in dire straits, beginning a slow shift to urbanization and limited industrialization; this period also saw the beginning of the <a href=\"/wiki/Great_Migration_(African_American)\" title=\"Great Migration (African American)\">Great Migration</a>.  The 1930s saw increasing urbanization and industrialization in the South; and, federal policies of the time, such as the <a href=\"/wiki/National_Industrial_Recovery_Act\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"National Industrial Recovery Act\">National Industrial Recovery Act</a> and the <a href=\"/wiki/Fair_Labor_Standards_Act\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Fair Labor Standards Act\">Fair Labor Standards Act</a>, attempted to force economic parity between the South and the rest of the nation (<a href=\"#Wright1987\">Wright 1987:171</a>).\n</p><p>By the time of the passing of the <a href=\"/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964\" title=\"Civil Rights Act of 1964\">Civil Rights Act of 1964</a>, the <a href=\"/wiki/Scientific_racism\" title=\"Scientific racism\">scientific racism</a> that had underlain much of the justification for the Jim Crow era legal racism had been discredited, the South had substantially closed its wealth gap with the rest of the nation, and America was both urbanized and industrialized.  However, the African American struggle to earn economic parity, that had made progress during the first half century of the postbellum era, had largely been reversed during the second half.  Legally, equality was assured, but that did little to actually promulgate equal conditions in daily life.\n</p><p>Some of the gains in the South's economic relation to the rest of the U.S. can be explained by population shifts to other regions; so, it may have had as much to do with spreading poverty around, as spreading wealth around.  In the period when agriculture had formed the basis of the economy, land and labor were intimately tied together in the ownership of farmland; in the shift to urban industrialization, neither land tenure, nor labor opportunities were necessarily improved for African Americans.  Thus, to understand the Jim Crow economy it is required to look to the social and political climate prior to the implementation of the laws, and to the economic inertia that continued to impact people's lives after the repeal of the laws.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Usage\">Usage</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Jim_Crow_economy&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Usage\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Frequently sources will mention the Jim Crow economy, and then proceed to discuss only what is specific to the topic being broached by a particular author; however, unlike the laws passed to restrict access to services and education, the laws that governed the economy were often written in race-neutral terms, with inequality stemming from enforcement decisions.  The economic impacts of Jim Crow are also intertwined with changes in the overall economy of the United States, from the Civil War through the 20th century.  There is a temporal rhythm to the economic impacts of Jim Crow; from the <a href=\"/wiki/Reconstruction_era_of_the_United_States\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Reconstruction era of the United States\">Reconstruction</a> onward, social trends preceded policy changes that, in turn, preceded economic changes.\n</p><p>Just in the last decade, \"the Jim Crow economy\" has been mentioned in the context of 19th century taxi drivers (<a href=\"#Ortiz2006\">Ortiz 2006</a>), mid-20th century urban industrialization (<a href=\"#Godwin2000\">Godwin 2000</a>), post-<a href=\"/wiki/World_War_II\" title=\"World War II\">World War II</a> domestic service (<a href=\"#Kusmer2009\">Kusmer &amp; Trotter 2009</a>), and even in regard to <a href=\"/wiki/Lumbee\" title=\"Lumbee\">Lumbee</a> Indians in North Carolina (<a href=\"#Lowery2010\">Lowery 2010</a>).  Clearly, it is a topic that covers a great deal of breadth; but, in dealing with only particular topics, there is always the risk of losing sight of the issue as a whole.  Moreover, there is the risk of applying it to any economic topic in the Jim Crow era, making the phrase meaningless.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Land\">Land</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Jim_Crow_economy&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Land\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In the decades following the Civil War, there were steady increases in African American ownership of farmland in the South, from 3&#160;million acres (12,000&#160;km<sup>2</sup>) in 1875, to 8&#160;million acres (32,000&#160;km<sup>2</sup>) in 1890, 12&#160;million acres (49,000&#160;km<sup>2</sup>) at the turn of the century, and peaking at 12,800,000 acres (52,000&#160;km<sup>2</sup>) in 1910 (<a href=\"#Reynolds2002\">Reynolds 2002:4</a>).  Other estimates suggest that total black ownership of land in the South may have been as much as 15&#160;million acres (61,000&#160;km<sup>2</sup>) within a half century after emancipation (<a href=\"#Mitchell2000\">Mitchell 2000:507</a>).  There were also setbacks, due to property being taken illegally; in the first 30 years of the 20th century, 24,000 acres (97&#160;km<sup>2</sup>) were taken, from 406 separate landowners (<a href=\"#Darity2003\">Darity Jr. &amp; Frank 2003:327</a>).  By 1930, the number of black owned farms was 3% lower than what it had been at the turn of the century (<a href=\"#Woodman1997\">Woodman 1997:22</a>).\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Rural\">Rural</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Jim_Crow_economy&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Rural\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>After being freed, there were 2 main ways for African Americans to acquire land in the South: either buy it from a private landowner, or stake a claim to public land offered by the federal government under laws like the <a href=\"/wiki/Southern_Homestead_Act_of_1866\" title=\"Southern Homestead Act of 1866\">Southern Homestead Act of 1866</a>, and by state governments, such as South Carolina's Land Commission.  The Southern Homestead Act opened up the transfer of public land in the states of Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi, with the hope of providing land to freedmen by limiting the claims to 80 acres (320,000&#160;m<sup>2</sup>) for the first 2 years (<a href=\"#Pope1970\">Pope 1970:203</a>).\n</p><p>The results were less purchasers than had been hoped for, largely because the recently freed slaves did not have the material means to settle unimproved property, and only 4,000 of the 11, 633 total claims were registered by freedmen (<a href=\"#Pope1970\">Pope 1970:205</a>).  Within the South, the Southern Homestead Act was seen as further punishment of attempting to secede; this was substantiated, by the repeal of 1876, when old enmities gave way to the promise of federal revenues (<a href=\"#Gates1940\">Gates 1940:311</a>).  After the Act was repealed, cash sales of public lands were reopened to large-scale purchasers; the repeal was reversed in 1888, but prior to that point more than 5,500,000 acres (22,000&#160;km<sup>2</sup>) of land in the 5 public land states of the South were sold off to land speculators and timber harvesters (<a href=\"#Gates1936\">Gates 1936:667</a>).\n</p><p>South Carolina's Land Commission was a unique case of a Reconstruction-era state government organization that was formed explicitly for the purpose of selling bonds to fund the purchase of non-operating plantations and selling the land to small farm operators over a 10-year repayment schedule at 7% annual interest (<a href=\"#Bethel1997\">Bethel 1997:20</a>).  From 1868-1879, the Land Commission sold farmland to 14,000 African American families (<a href=\"#Bethel1997\">Bethel 1997:27</a>).  Another well documented sample of African American property ownership in a non-public land state comes from census and tax records in Georgia.  In the year following the end of the Civil War, black property owners accumulated approximately 10,000 acres (40&#160;km<sup>2</sup>) of land, with a value of about $22,500; however, on average, African Americans in Georgia held a total wealth of less than $1 per person (<a href=\"#Higgs1982\">Higgs 1982:728</a>).  Between 1880-1910, Georgia's African Americans increased their average wealth, from $8 per person to $26.59, with some setbacks occurring around the turn of the century; however, relative to white Georgians, that amounted to an increase from 2% to 6% of total wealth held (<a href=\"#Higgs1982\">Higgs 1982:729</a>).\n</p><p>By expanding the defined territory of the South to 16 states (including Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia), in 1910, there were 175,000 black farm owners compared to 1.15 million white farm owners (<a href=\"#Higgs1973\">Higgs 1973:150</a>).  Discounting the states of Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland, Oklahoma, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia, the average white-owned farm was nearly twice the size of the average black-owned farm (<a href=\"#Higgs1973\">Higgs 1973:162</a>).\n</p><p>Land ownership was an important source of capital for both groups, but the ability to use the land with maximal productivity was not equally afforded to both groups.  From the antebellum period up to the mid-1880s, all land owners were highly dependent on credit from merchant transporters of cotton; however, as the transportation infrastructure improved the white land owners were able to use their greater land holdings to attract credit directly from Northern financiers, and were thus able to usurp the position of the merchant transporters that furnished necessary staple goods to cotton growers (<a href=\"#Woodman1977\">Woodman 1977:547</a>).\n</p><p>Drawing from a representative sample of 4,695 farms in 27 counties in Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, and South Carolina, regarding the 1879-1880 cotton crop, white owners were able to leave more than 4 times the amount of land fallow, had nearly twice the value in farming implements, and were more than a third more likely to have access to fertilizer than were the black land owners (<a href=\"#Ransom1973\">Ransom &amp; Sutch 1973:141</a>).

In the decade of World War I both groups were leaving the South, with whites leaving at a slightly higher rate; but in the decade of World War II, the South lost 1.58 million blacks, and only 866,000 whites (<a href=\"#Wright1987\">Wright 1987:174</a>).\n</p><p>In the decade from 1950\u20131960, the net out-migration was 1.2 million blacks, to only 234,000 whites; but, from 1960-1970 the picture changed dramatically, still losing 1.38 million blacks, but gaining 1.8 million whites.  Starting in the decade of 1970-1980, there was a net influx of both groups, but with a markedly higher rate for whites, at 3.56 million to only 206,000.  The raw numbers mask that the median education level of African Americans migrating out of the South was 6.6 years, up to 1960; whereas, by that same time, slightly more than a third of the white males in the South, with more than 5 years of college, had been born outside that region (<a href=\"#Wright1987\">Wright 1987:173</a>).

The South was overwhelmingly based on agricultural production through the postbellum years, only seeing substantial increases in industrial manufacturing starting in the 1930s; and, for those who did not own farmland, the dominant forms of employment were: farm laborer, sharecropper, share-renter, and fixed renter.  Throughout this period there were some large landholders that used a set wage for farm laborers; however, the general lack of banks in the South made this arrangement problematic (<a href=\"#Parker1980\">Parker 1980:1024-1025</a>).\n</p><p>Using a set wage for laborers without contracts presented the problem of either overpaying during periods when labor demands were low, or risking the loss of the laborer during the peak of harvest season (<a href=\"#Roback1984\">Roback 1984:1172</a>).  Thus, the dominant pattern was to contract labor for an entire season which, when combined with the lack of liquid capital, favored the development of sharecroppers who received a share of the profits from the sale of the crops at the end of the season, or share-renters who paid a share of their crops as rent at the end of the season (<a href=\"#Parker1980\">Parker 1980:1028-1030</a>).\n</p><p>Whether white or black, the wage earned by the tenant farmer was relatively equal (<a href=\"#Higgs1973\">Higgs 1973:151</a>).

By the last decade of the 19th century, the planter class had recovered from the Civil War enough to both keep Northern industrialist manufacturing interests out of the South, and to take the role of merchant themselves (<a href=\"#Woodman1977\">Woodman 1977:546</a>).\n</p><p>As the planter class came back to prominence, the rural and urban middle class lost power, and the poor rural tenant farmers were set in opposition based both on race, and the inherent superiority of the wealthy landowner (<a href=\"#Nicholls1964\">Nicholls 1964:25</a>).

Vagrancy laws functioned to keep workers from exiting the labor force entirely, and were often used to forcibly ensure that every able body was engaged in some form of work; in some cases, African Americans were made into misdemeanants, through vagrancy laws, just on the basis of traveling outside the territory where they were personally known (<a href=\"#Roback1984\">Roback 1984:1168</a>).

In the South, industrial growth started with labor-intensive, unskilled industries; for example, manufacturing employment increased from 14.5% in 1930 to 21.3% in 1960, but the increase was largest for non-durable goods (<a href=\"#Nicholls1964\">Nicholls 1964:26-27</a>).

There was also more pressure for African American women to work outside the home, often for low wages in the domestic service sector; for example, in the late 1930s, female domestics earned $3\u20138 per week, sometimes a bit less in the South (<a href=\"#Thernstrom1999\">Thernstrom &amp; Thernstrom 1999:35</a>).\n</p><p>For black females, throughout the South, manufacturing employment rose from 3.5% in 1940, to 17.2% in 1980; for that same time period, personal service employment decreased from 65.8%, to 13.7% (<a href=\"#Heckman1989\">Heckman &amp; Payner 1989:1989</a>).  One study, looking at non-agricultural employment from 1920\u20131930, determined that black males were losing jobs not to industrial mechanization, but to white males (<a href=\"#Anderson1996\">Anderson &amp; Halcoussis 1996:12</a>).\n</p><p>During the civil rights era, \"economic coercion\" was used to prevent participation, by denying credit, causing evictions, and canceling insurance policies (<a href=\"#Bobo1998\">Bobo &amp; Smith 1998:208</a>).

In the most extreme analysis, the level of urban residential segregation, along the unidirectional economic dependency of African American communities, presents the possibility that they may be treated as a \"national collectivity of internal colonies\" (<a href=\"#Bailey1973\">Bailey 1973:61</a>).\n</p><p>From this perspective, small black-owned businesses are seen as the \"ghetto domestic sector,\" white-owned businesses that operate within the internal colonies are seen as the \"ghetto enclave sector,\" and the black laborers that work outside the community are seen as the \"ghetto labor-export sector\" (<a href=\"#Bailey1973\">Bailey 1973:62</a>).

Race-based life insurance rates began in the early 1880s, and included higher rates, reduced benefits, and no commission for the insurance agent on policies written for African Americans.  When state laws were passed to prevent race-based differential insurance rates, companies simply stopped selling insurance to black clients in those states (<a href=\"#Heen2009\">Heen 2009:369</a>).

Frequently, the recipients of such property do not realize that if one of the common owners wishes to sell their share, then the entire estate can be put up for partition sale.  Most state statutes suggest that partition in kind be preferred over partition sale, except where properties cannot be divided equitably for the parties involved; however, many courts opt to require properties be put up for partition sale because the monetary value of the land is higher as a single parcel than a number of subdivided parcels, and also, to some extent, because the utility value of rural land is higher if it can be used a single productive unit (<a href=\"#Mitchell2000\">Mitchell 2000:514-515;563</a>).\n</p><p>This means that a land developer can purchase one person's share of a tenancy in common, and then use their position to force a partition sale of the entire property.  Thus, a person who has inherited a common share of a property that they do not personally use, might be inclined to sell their share thinking that they are only selling the rights to a portion of the property, and wind up initiating the displacement of other inheritors that are actually living on the property.
