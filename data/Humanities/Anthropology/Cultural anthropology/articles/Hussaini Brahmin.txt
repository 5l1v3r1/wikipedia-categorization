Hussaini Brahmin  is a Mohyal community with links to both Hinduism and Islam. They are spread across Sindh and Punjab in Pakistan; Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Delhi and other parts of India, and also in Arabia. Citing source from history of the Muhiyals, published in 1911 CE it is disclosed that about 1400 Brahmins had been living in Baghdad when the event of Karbala took place.  There are various opinions regarding the origins of the community. About 125 families of Hussaini Brahmins are settled in Pune.  A few families are settled in Delhi also and they observe Muharram every year.  Among various legends about Hussaini Barahmin it is also described that a childless Dutt personally visited Hussain Ibn Ali and submitted his wish to have a child.  In response to his desire, he was informed that he had no child in his fate. Hearing that he cannot be a father of  son Dutt became senseless and broke down in crying with pain for grant of a child by Imam Hussain with recommendations to God.  At this moment, Hussain pacified him saying he will have one soon.  Suddenly someone observing the event questioned Hussain stating that he had challenged the will  of Allah. Upon hearing this Imam told Dutt he will have one more child. This continued till Imam gave him good news of seven children.   Hussaini Brahmins used to live in Lahore till 1947 and after that date they migrated to other locations.  In Ajmer, Rajasthan, a place of Sunni Muslim pilgrimage, where Moinuddin Chishti lived and passed his last days, there is even today a class of people who call themselves Hussaini Brahmins, who are neither orthodox Hindus nor orthodox Muslims. Hussaini Brahmins practiced a mixed blend of Hinduism and Islamic traditions. A popular saying in Hindi/Urdu language refers to the Hussaini Brahmans thus: "Wah Datt Sultan, Hindu ka dharm, Musalman ka Iman, Adha Hindu adha Musalman (Well Datt Sultan, declaring Hindu religion and following Muslim faith, Half Hindu and Half Muslman).
