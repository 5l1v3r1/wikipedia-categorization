Being multidisciplinary and involving many scientific fields, media stylistics can be as well considered a branch of media linguistics. Media stylistics investigates how media speech depends on the type of content, aims of communicators and the whole communicative situation. Media stylistics as a research approach is widely known in Eastern Europe and especially in Russia. The tractates of A. Vasileva, M. Kozhina, V. Kostomarov, L. Maydanova, I. Lysakova, K. Rogova, G. Solganik etc. have laid the foundations of Russian media stylistics. Modern media stylistics in Russia develops mainly as stylistics of media text. It tends to analyze the media text in all its complex integrative nature. The main particular problems of media stylistics are: Along with stylistics of socio-political texts (V. Konkov, V. Salimovsky, G. Solganik, N. Klushina), the stylistics of journalistic leisure-texts develops (L. Duskaeva, N. Klushina, V. Konkov, E. Kara-Murza, T. Redkina, N. Tsvetova). The intentional-stylistic approach to the study of these texts develops extensively (V. Barbashov, L. Duskaeva, N. Kornilova, K.Prokhorova, N. Tsvetova) as well as stylistic approach to lingvo-etic problems (N. Bessarabova, T. Surikova, V. Suzdaltseva). As separate lines of media stylistics can be considered semiotic lingvostylistics of advertising texts (E. Kara-Murza), expert media stylistics (A. Baranov, E. Kara-Murza, M. Gorbanevsky, T. Chernyshova), stylistics of online media texts (E. Kakorina, T. Karpova).
