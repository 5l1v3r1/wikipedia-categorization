Deutsche Afrika-Schau ("German Africa Show") was an exhibition touted as an ethnographic depiction of African people and customs that toured Germany in the 1937 to 1940.  It was a continuation of earlier VÃ¶lkerschauen ("people shows"), a human zoo anthropological exhibition that toured in Germany in the decades before Nazi Germany. Nazi propaganda used the Deutsche Afrika-Schau to promote ideology supporting German colonization in Africa and featured depictions of loyal African Askari soldiers at a time when African minorities in Germany were denied basic rights. Bayume Mohamed Husen who had taught Swahili was part of the show along with  Kwassi Bruce and Adolf Hillerkus. Germans with African ancestry dressed up in costumes and performed dances and other acts for the show.
