Ollamh Clanricarde was a hereditary post, held almost exclusively by members of the McEgan family. An ollamh was the highest rank in the learned orders of law, poetry, or history.  These educated professionals, today grouped together in the popular consciousness as "bards", maintained  an oral tradition that pre-dated Christianization of Ireland. Clanricarde was a territory located in south Connacht.
