Ambilineality is a cognatic descent system in which individuals may be affiliated either to their father's or mother's group. This type of descent results in descent groups which are non-unilineal in the sense that descent passes either through women or men, contrary to unilineal systems, whether patrilineal or matrilineal. Affiliation to a descent group will be determined either by choice or by residence. In the latter case, children will belong to the descent group with whom their parents are living. Societies practicing ambilineal descent are especially common in Southeast Asia  and the Pacific. Polynesian cultures and Micronesian cultures are often ambilineal, including, for example, Samoans, MƒÅori , Hawaiians and people of the Gilbert Islands .  The indigenous peoples of Northwestern North America are also followers of ambilineality; and it also found among the Southern  Yoruba people  residing in West Africa.
