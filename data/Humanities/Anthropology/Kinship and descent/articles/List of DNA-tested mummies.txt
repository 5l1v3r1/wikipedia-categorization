This is a purported list of ancient humans remains, including mummies, that may have been DNA tested. Provided as evidence of the testing are links to the mitochondrial DNA sequences, and/or to the human haplogroups to which each case has been assigned. Also provided is a brief description of when and where they lived.[according to whom?] Entries lacking a citation should be viewed with skepticism; in particular, cases with no sequence or haplogroup links, with citation, have no evidentiary basis for appearing. The following mummies have undergone an mtDNA (mitochondrial DNA) test, of remains with the indicated name, from the indicated locations:  The following mummies have undergone DNA tests, of remains with the indicated name, from the indicated locations:  D16S539, D18S51, CSF1PO, FGA   D16S539, D18S51, CSF1PO, FGA   D16S539, D18S51, CSF1PO, FGA   D16S539, D18S51, CSF1PO, FGA   D16S539, D18S51, CSF1PO, FGA   D16S539, D18S51, CSF1PO, FGA   D16S539, D18S51, CSF1PO, FGA   D16S539, D18S51, CSF1PO, FGA   D16S539, CSF1PO   D16S539, D18S51, CSF1PO, FGA   D16S539, D18S51, CSF1PO, FGA
