A Chinese compound surname is a Chinese surname using more than one character. Many of these surnames derive from noble and official titles, professions, place names and other areas, to serve for a purpose. Some are originally non-Han, while others were created by joining two one-character family names. Only a few of these names (e.g. Ouyang [歐陽/欧阳], Shangguan [上官], Sima [司馬/司马] and Situ [司徒]) have survived in modern times with Ouyang (歐陽/欧阳) appearing most frequently. Many clans eventually took on a single-character surname for various reasons. Chinese surnames with more than two characters are not of Han origin (e.g. Manchurian or Mongolian), and are becoming exceedingly rare to find and still be in use today.
