A mahram is an unmarriageable kin with whom marriage or sexual intercourse would be considered haram, illegal in Islam, or people from whom purdah is not obligatory or legal escorts of a woman during journey longer than a day and night, 24 hours. (Note: Marriage with stepfather is prohibited only if the man has consummated with her mother)   These are considered mahram because they are mentioned in the Quran (An-Nisa 22-23): "And marry not women whom your fathers married, except what has already passed; indeed it was shameful and most hateful, and an evil way. Forbidden to you (for marriage) are: your mothers, your daughters, your sisters, your paternal aunts, your maternal aunts, brother's daughters, sister's daughters, your foster mothers, your sisters from suckling, mothers of your spouses, your step-daughters from your those spouses you have entered into them but if you have not entered into them then there is no blame on you, spouses of your sons from your own loins and that you add two sisters except that has passed; indeed God is forgiving and merciful. All of the man's female relatives mentioned in these two verses are considered his maharim, because it is unlawful (haram) for him to marry them, except the wife's sister mentioned last, who is not a mahram because he can marry her if he divorces her sister, or if his wife dies. The notion of mahram is reciprocal. All other relatives are considered non-maharim and they fall under the category of strangers. Exception: for the schools of thought which deem hijab as compulsory, it is lawful for a woman to uncover herself in front of a potential husband. A woman's male mahrams fall into four categories (three categories in the strict-sense definition that does not count one's spouse). Mahrams for a man can be derived in a similar manner.   Exception: an adopted brother who suckled the mother of the woman is axiomatically a mahram.
