In French Guiana (not to be confused with Guyana) and Suriname, Bushinengues (meaning people of the forest) are the descendants of slaves taken to Suriname to work in plantations. Their communities were the result of a growing movement amongst slaves to escape enslavement and establish independent communities in the forest. Whilst a significant portion remained in Suriname, the majority ended up in Guyane. There are six major groups of Bushinengues:  The languages of the Bushinengues are all English-based creoles.
