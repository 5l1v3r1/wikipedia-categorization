Practices were enforced in communities. Such was the case in classical Greece \u2013 which made clear distinctions between Greeks and Barbarians. The Roman Republic had a different pattern. While it was expansionist, and militarily and culturally aggressive, it actively encouraged the Romanisation of client kingdoms, which included intermarriage of Romans with their elite citizens and making this class citizens of Rome as reward and as exemplars.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Hypo.2Fhyperdescent_in_Colonial-Era_North_America\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Hypo/hyperdescent_in_Colonial-Era_North_America\">Hypo/hyperdescent in Colonial-Era North America</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Hypodescent&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Hypo/hyperdescent in Colonial-Era North America\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The North American practice of applying a rule of hypodescent began during colonial times when indentured servants and transported convicts working at the direction of the colonists and colonial authorities were joined by Africans that from 1619 on were first taken first  from Spanish and then more and more from English or British slave ships. But while the freed captives were Christians, these individuals were classified as indentured workers.\n</p><p>Virginia formally enacted a 'slave code' in 1705. There is documentary evidence from the 1650s that some Virginia Negroes were serving lifelong terms of indenture. In the 1660s the Assembly stated that \"any English servant that shall run away in company with any Negroes who are incapable of making satisfaction by addition of time shall serve for the time of the said Negroes absence\", indicating Negroes could not 'make satisfaction' by serving longer if recaptured. This device gave legal status to the practice of lifetime enslavement of persons of African descent; in subsequent statutes the legislature defined conditions of lifetime servitude. \n</p><p>But in 1655 <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Elizabeth_Key&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Elizabeth Key (page does not exist)\">Elizabeth Key</a>, a mixed-race woman, fought and won the first <a href=\"/wiki/Freedom_suit\" title=\"Freedom suit\">freedom suit</a> in Virginia. Her English father had acknowledged her as his daughter, had her baptised as Christian, and, falling ill, established a legal guardian to care for her after his death, arranging a limited-term indenture for her as a girl. But the guardian sold her indenture and left the colony, and the next master did not free her. When he died, his estate claimed her and her son as slave property.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Banks_2-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Banks-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>However, following Key's victory, Virginia established the principle in law in 1662 of <i><a href=\"/wiki/Partus_sequitur_ventrem\" title=\"Partus sequitur ventrem\">partus sequitur ventrem</a></i>, from Roman law; that is, children born in the colonies would take the social status of their mothers. This meant that all children born to enslaved women would be born into slavery, regardless of their paternity and race. This was in contrast to English common law, by which the status of children of English subjects was determined by the father.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Banks_2-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Banks-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> \n</p><p>As slavery became a racial caste system, persons of only partial African ancestry and majority European ancestry were born into slavery. African descent became associated with slavery. By hypodescent, persons of even partial African ancestry were classified socially below whites. By the late 18th century, there were numerous families of majority-white slaves, such as the <a href=\"/wiki/Mixed-race\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Mixed-race\">mixed-race</a> children born to the slave <a href=\"/wiki/Sally_Hemings\" title=\"Sally Hemings\">Sally Hemings</a> and her master <a href=\"/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson\" title=\"Thomas Jefferson\">Thomas Jefferson</a>. She was three-quarters white and the half-sister of his late wife; their children, born into slavery, were seven-eighths white. Jefferson gave the four surviving children their freedom as adults; three assimilated into white society. \n</p><p>The Southern author <a href=\"/wiki/Mary_Chesnut\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Mary Chesnut\">Mary Chesnut</a> wrote in her famous <i><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=A_Diary_from_Dixie&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"A Diary from Dixie (page does not exist)\">A Diary from Dixie</a></i>, of the <a href=\"/wiki/American_Civil_War\" title=\"American Civil War\">Civil War</a>-era, about the hypocrisy of a man's recognizing white women's children among the slaves in every household but his own.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Fanny_Kemble\" title=\"Fanny Kemble\">Fanny Kemble</a>, the British actress who married an American slaveholder, wrote about her observations of slavery as well, including the way white men sexually abused slave women and left their mixed-race children enslaved.\n</p><p>Sometimes the white fathers freed the children and/or their mothers, or provided education or apprenticeship, or settled property on them in a significant transfer of social capital. Notable <a href=\"/wiki/Antebellum_South\" title=\"Antebellum South\">antebellum</a> examples of fathers who provided for their mixed-race children were the fathers of <a href=\"/wiki/Charles_Henry_Langston\" title=\"Charles Henry Langston\">Charles Henry Langston</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/John_Mercer_Langston\" title=\"John Mercer Langston\">John Mercer Langston</a> and the father of the <a href=\"/wiki/Healy_family_of_Georgia\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Healy family of Georgia\">Healy family of Georgia</a>.

Other mixed-race children were left enslaved; some were sold away by their fathers.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Research by historians and <a href=\"/wiki/Genealogist\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Genealogist\">genealogists</a> has shown that unlike the above examples, most free African Americans listed in the first two US censuses in the Upper South were descended from relationships or marriages in colonial Virginia between white women, indentured servant or free, and African or African-American men, indentured servant, free or slave. Their unions reflected the fluid nature of relationships among the working classes before slave caste was hardened, as well as the small households and farms within which many people worked. The children of white mothers were born free. If they were illegitimate and mixed race, they were apprenticed in order to avoid the community being burdened with upkeep, but such persons gained a step in freedom.<sup id=\"cite_ref-freeaa_4-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-freeaa-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> \n</p><p>By the turn of the nineteenth century, many of these families of free African Americans, along with European-American neighbors, migrated to frontier areas of Virginia, North Carolina, and then further west. Such families sometimes settled in insular groups. Mixed-race people of African-European descent are believed to have been the origin of some isolated settlements, which have long claimed or were said to be of <a href=\"/wiki/Indigenous_people_of_the_Americas\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Indigenous people of the Americas\">American Indian</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Portuguese_people\" title=\"Portuguese people\">Portuguese</a> ancestry.<sup id=\"cite_ref-freeaa_4-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-freeaa-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> As an example, a 21st-century <a href=\"/wiki/DNA\" title=\"DNA\">DNA</a> study of a group of <a href=\"/wiki/Melungeon\" title=\"Melungeon\">Melungeon</a> families in Tennessee and Kentucky, long rumored to be descendants of Turks or Native Americans, showed they were overwhelmingly of African and European ancestry.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Hypo.2Fhyperdescent_in_Reconstruction.2C_late_19th_century_and_20th-century_United_States\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Hypo/hyperdescent_in_Reconstruction,_late_19th_century_and_20th-century_United_States\">Hypo/hyperdescent in Reconstruction, late 19th century and 20th-century United States</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Hypodescent&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Hypo/hyperdescent in Reconstruction, late 19th century and 20th-century United States\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>By the late 1870s, conservative white Democrats regained power in state legislatures across the South, even in areas where there were black majorities, largely by a process of violence and intimidation of black Republicans. The Democrats gradually imposed <a href=\"/wiki/White_supremacy\" title=\"White supremacy\">white supremacy</a> in law and practice. From 1890 to 1908, beginning with Mississippi, the state legislatures passed new constitutions and laws that created barriers to voter registration by such means as the <a href=\"/wiki/Poll_tax\" title=\"Poll tax\">poll tax</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Literacy_tests\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Literacy tests\">literacy tests</a>, record requirements and others. The number of voters on the rolls fell drastically and most blacks and many poor whites were <a href=\"/wiki/Disfranchisement_after_Reconstruction_era_(United_States)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era (United States)\">disenfranchised</a> for decades. The whites also passed <a href=\"/wiki/Jim_Crow\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Jim Crow\">Jim Crow</a> laws, such as <a href=\"/wiki/Racial_segregation\" title=\"Racial segregation\">racial segregation</a> of public facilities. \n</p><p>African Americans and whites established the <a href=\"/wiki/National_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Colored_People\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"National Association for the Advancement of Colored People\">National Association for the Advancement of Colored People</a> in 1909 to fight against legal discrimination and disenfranchisement. Each time they won a court case, for instance, against the use of <a href=\"/wiki/White_primaries\" title=\"White primaries\">white primaries</a>, white-dominated legislatures would pass new laws to exclude blacks from the political system.\n</p><p>In the 20th century, under influences of <a href=\"/wiki/Eugenics\" title=\"Eugenics\">eugenics</a> and racial discrimination, states enacted laws classifying persons as black who had any traceable evidence (or perception of any African ancestry). Under Virginia's <a href=\"/wiki/Racial_Integrity_Act\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Racial Integrity Act\">Racial Integrity Act</a> of 1924, the 'One-drop' rule defined as black a person with <i>any</i> known African ancestry, regardless of the number of intervening generations.\n</p><p>The same Act established a binary classification system for vital records, classifying persons as 'white' or 'black' (Negro at the time). The latter was effectively a 'catch all' term for all people of color. Native Americans were classified as colored, l attitude to <i>all</i> races other than white.\n</p><p>In its most extreme form in the United States, hypodescent was the basis of the \"<a href=\"/wiki/One-drop_theory\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"One-drop theory\">one drop rule</a>\", meaning that if an individual had any black ancestry, the person was classified as black. Laws were passed in southern states and others in the early 20th century, long after the end of slavery to define white and black, under associated laws for segregation: <a href=\"/wiki/Tennessee\" title=\"Tennessee\">Tennessee</a> adopted such a \"one-drop\" statute in 1910; <a href=\"/wiki/Louisiana\" title=\"Louisiana\">Louisiana</a>; <a href=\"/wiki/Texas\" title=\"Texas\">Texas</a>; <a href=\"/wiki/Arkansas\" title=\"Arkansas\">Arkansas</a> in 1911; <a href=\"/wiki/Mississippi\" title=\"Mississippi\">Mississippi</a> in 1917; <a href=\"/wiki/North_Carolina\" title=\"North Carolina\">North Carolina</a> in 1923; <a href=\"/wiki/Virginia\" title=\"Virginia\">Virginia</a> in 1924; <a href=\"/wiki/Alabama\" title=\"Alabama\">Alabama</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)\" title=\"Georgia (U.S. state)\">Georgia</a> in 1927; and <a href=\"/wiki/Oklahoma\" title=\"Oklahoma\">Oklahoma</a> in 1931.\n</p><p>During this same period, <a href=\"/wiki/Florida\" title=\"Florida\">Florida</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Indiana\" title=\"Indiana\">Indiana</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Kentucky\" title=\"Kentucky\">Kentucky</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Maryland\" title=\"Maryland\">Maryland</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Missouri\" title=\"Missouri\">Missouri</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Nebraska\" title=\"Nebraska\">Nebraska</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/North_Dakota\" title=\"North Dakota\">North Dakota</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Utah\" title=\"Utah\">Utah</a> retained their old \"blood fraction\" statutes <i><a href=\"/wiki/De_jure\" title=\"De jure\">de jure</a></i>, but amended these fractions (one-sixteenth, one-thirtysecond) to be equivalent to one-drop <i><a href=\"/wiki/De_facto\" title=\"De facto\">de facto</a>.</i><sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>By 1924 many \"white\" people in Virginia would have had some African and/or Native American ancestry, given the mixing over the centuries.
