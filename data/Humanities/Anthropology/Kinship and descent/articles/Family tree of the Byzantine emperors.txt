This is a family tree of all the Eastern Roman Emperors who ruled in Constantinople. Where three dates are given, the middle date is the date of accession. If an emperor reigned for more than one sitting, his lifetime dates are given followed by the dates of his reigns. Dynasty names are given in capitals so that they can be picked out from the interweaving trees.
