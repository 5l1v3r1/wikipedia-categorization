Unlike novels by such writers as <a href=\"/wiki/James_A._Michener\" title=\"James A. Michener\">James A. Michener</a>, these stories do not trace the rise and fall of the fortunes of a clan or extended family, but simply tie together significant and minor characters in several of the Western novels.\n</p><p>L'Amour's Sackett family originates in <a href=\"/wiki/The_Fens\" title=\"The Fens\">The Fens</a> of <a href=\"/wiki/Cambridgeshire\" title=\"Cambridgeshire\">Cambridgeshire</a> in <a href=\"/wiki/East_Anglia\" title=\"East Anglia\">East Anglia</a>.  The patriarch of the family, Barnabas Sackett, becomes a merchant captain and eventually settles with his wife Abigail (n\u00e9e Tempany) in what will become the borderlands of <a href=\"/wiki/North_Carolina\" title=\"North Carolina\">North Carolina</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Tennessee\" title=\"Tennessee\">Tennessee</a>. The family quickly divides into three clans, sired by several of their sons: the \"Smoky Mountain Sacketts\", \"Cumberland Gap Sacketts\", and \"Clinch Mountain Sacketts\". There are also Flatland Sacketts, but are rarely touched upon in the novels. It is the Smoky Mountain Sacketts that produce some of L'Amour's most memorable and beloved characters, including William Tell \"Tell\" Sackett and his brothers Tyrel and Orrin, of the novel \"Sackett\" (see below) and others.  Orrin was a Sheriff, legislator and eventually senator. Tyrel became a respected rancher and lawman, often simply known as the \"Mora Gunfighter\" after the town he settled in.\n</p><p>The main theme that runs through most of the Sackett books is that of loyalty to the family and helping the family when beset by foes. \"When you step on the toes of one Sackett, they all come running.\" The deadly Sackett-Higgins feud in Tennessee lasted years.  As Tell Sackett notes in the book \"The Sackett Brand\", \"The last feud my family taken part in lasted seventy years. The last Higgins died with his gun in his hand, but he died.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>  \n</p><p>The Clinch Mountain boys tend to be rougher. The twins, Nolan and Logan have hired out their guns, held up a stage or two, but are decent men. Logan came to the aid of Emily Talon, herself a Sackett by birth, in Colorado.\n</p><p>Two other families whose members L'Amour wrote about, and whose families have rubbed shoulders at different times over the three centuries his novels cover, are the Chantry and Talon families, with Borden Chantry and Milo Talon being contemporaries of Tell Sackett.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Sackett_.28the_novel.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sackett_(the_novel)\"><i>Sackett</i> (the novel)</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Sackett&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Sackett (the novel)\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>This is the third of the Sackett novels and published in 1961 (<i>Daybreakers</i> was the first, published in 1960, though it is not the first chronologically).  It tells the story of William Tell Sackett, a <a href=\"/wiki/Union_Army\" title=\"Union Army\">Union Army</a> veteran who makes his way West in the years following the War, hoping to settle down at the right place as a rancher.  He is the main character in several other Sackett books including <i><a href=\"/wiki/Mojave_Crossing\" title=\"Mojave Crossing\">Mojave Crossing</a></i>, <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Lonely_Men\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Lonely Men\">The Lonely Men</a></i>, <i>Treasure Mountain</i>, and <i><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=The_Sackett_Brand&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"The Sackett Brand (page does not exist)\">The Sackett Brand</a></i>, among others.  He is the brother of Tyrel and Orrin Sackett, who went west to New Mexico circa 1870-1872. Tell is also the 'ugly duckling' (by his own admission) of the family. However, he does meet a beautiful woman named Ange Kerry in <i>Sackett</i> and falls in love. He loses her when she is brutally murdered in \"The Sackett Brand.\". He meets another lady in <i>Treasure Mountain</i>, and presumably marries her. L'Amour has left the ending to the imagination of the reader in this novel.\n</p><p>L'Amour confirmed to Dr. John Sackett that he found the name on Sackett's Well in a place west of Yuma.  The desert watering hole was named for <a href=\"/wiki/Cavalry\" title=\"Cavalry\">cavalry</a> Lt. <a href=\"/wiki/Delos_B._Sackett\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Delos B. Sackett\">Delos B. Sackett</a> who was an Indian fighter in the region before the Civil War. L'Amour has used names and places that roughly parallel a real branch of the Sackett Family, but the accounts are fictional.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Sackett_Companion\"><i>The Sackett Companion</i></span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Sackett&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: The Sackett Companion\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>This non-fiction book, published in 1988 a few months after Louis L'Amour's death, is his personal guide to the Sackett novels, with long lists of characters, locations, ships, weapons, and summaries of each of the novels.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Sackett.27s_Land_.28novel.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sackett's_Land_(novel)\"><i>Sackett's Land</i> (novel)</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Sackett&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Sackett&#039;s Land (novel)\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><i>Sackett's Land</i>, published in 1974, is the first novel chronologically of the Sackett novels, taking place around AD 1600 in <a href=\"/wiki/England\" title=\"England\">England</a> (including <a href=\"/wiki/The_Fens\" title=\"The Fens\">The Fens</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Queen_Elizabeth_I\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Queen Elizabeth I\">Queen Elizabeth I</a>'s <a href=\"/wiki/London\" title=\"London\">London</a>), on the <a href=\"/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean\" title=\"Atlantic Ocean\">Atlantic Ocean</a>, and the <a href=\"/wiki/Atlantic_Seaboard\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Atlantic Seaboard\">Atlantic Seaboard</a> of North America, particularly in the vicinity of <a href=\"/wiki/Cape_Hatteras\" title=\"Cape Hatteras\">Cape Hatteras</a>.

Rough, two-fisted, a man \"with the bark on\", and with a deserved reputation as being fast with a gun and hell-on wheels in any kind of fight, he has ridden the Owlhoot Trail and admits to skirting the dark side of the law on more than one occasion. A lot rougher than Orrin or Tyrel, he is nonetheless a generally decent man. Comes to the aid of his aunt, Emily Talon.\n</p><p><b>Nolan Sackett</b> \u2013 Twin Brother of Logan Sackett. Comes from the Clinch Mountain Branch of Sacketts. Like his brother, he has ridden the outlaw trail.

Their father liked his horses fast, his drinks hard, and his preachers Hellfire hot, and raised his three sons accordingly.  Although they often go long periods without seeing one another, they're completely devoted to one another, and come to each other's aid any time needed, dropping all else that they might be involved in at the time, true to the one bind rule in their lives: \"When you hunt one Sackett, you hunt 'em all\".\n</p><p><b>William Tell Sackett (<i>Tell</i>)</b> \u2013 Oldest son of Colburn Sackett (\"Ride the Dark Trail\" section of \"The Sackett Companion\"). Fought for the Union in the Civil War. A hard, tough, quiet man who wants only to be left alone, it takes very little to anger Tell, and he will fight like a rabid wolf if pushed, as several men have found out \u2013 usually, it's the last mistake they make. He's a loner, at home in the High Lonesome, often going years without seeing or communicating with his family back in Tennessee. He takes any job that suits him at the moment, from cowhand to miner, and drifts, rarely staying in one place any great length of time. He's killed several men in his lifetime, is fast and deadly accurate with any kind of gun, as well as the Tinker-made knife he carries. Although outwardly he appears rough, he has a sound, strong moral character, never forgetting his father's rule of \"...always ride on the side of the law, never against it\". In the film adaptations he is portrayed by <a href=\"/wiki/Sam_Elliott\" title=\"Sam Elliott\">Sam Elliott</a>.\n</p><p><b>Orrin Sackett</b> \u2013 Second son of Colburn Sackett. Orrin likes people and tries to see the best of them. Handsome, witty, and smart, he likes to believe that most people like him, however he can be a bit naive at times. Good with a gun, and always ready with a smile and a quote, he's strong willed and completely devoted to his family. He is calm during a fight, never getting excited or losing his head, a trait that is in all three brothers. Married twice, he killed a member of the Higgins family during a gunfight, only to have Long Higgens come after him on his wedding day. Orrin was unarmed, and his new wife jumped in front of him as Higgins fired, killing her. Orrin's brother Tyrel killed Higgins, then left Tennessee to avoid further problems. Orrin left soon after, promising his mother they'd send for her. He then married the treacherous Laura Pritts who tried to use him as part of her bigoted father's land grab in Santa Fe against the settled Mexican landowners.\n</p><p>Later after she is exposed as a fraud she attempts to lure William Tell into Apache country to rescue her nonexistent son with Orrin, a plan which fails. Always honest and straightforward, the fights that Orrin usually finds himself a part of are generally started by his steadfast and unwavering stance on something he believes strongly in. A smooth talker, Orrin has no problem making friends, especially of the female persuasion. He later was elected sheriff of <a href=\"/wiki/Santa_Fe,_New_Mexico\" title=\"Santa Fe, New Mexico\">Santa Fe, New Mexico</a>, where his reputation as a man fair to all ethnicities, Hispanic and Anglo alike, gained him respect.\n</p><p>In one of the novels, Orrin's ex-wife Laura Pritts has sent men to kill him. As one of his brothers relates it, \"Seems like they'd been told they were hunting a lawyer.  Well, there's lawyers and there's lawyers, just like there was a dentist named Doc Holliday.\"  The man died.  In the film adaptations he is portrayed by <a href=\"/wiki/Tom_Selleck\" title=\"Tom Selleck\">Tom Selleck</a>.\n</p><p><b>Tyrel Sackett</b> \u2013 Third son of Colburn Sackett. He idolizes his brothers Tell and Orrin. Known throughout the West as the Mora Gunfighter, and by his brothers as the \"mean one\" or the \"black sheep\", Tyrel is the fastest with a gun of the three brothers.  He always thinks things through, never acting prior to planning things out. Wherever Tyrel goes, he seems to attract trouble, and sooner or later someone always tries to outdraw him, but never succeeds \u2013 by his own admission: \"Till the day I hung 'em up, I was the fastest gun alive.\" And he's left enough bodies behind him to prove it. Compassionate to a fault, his sense of morals never leave him, and stands as a steady guide on his way west. In Santa Fe he is forced to kill Tom Sunday, a close friend who'd gone bad after losing what he saw as his last chance to start a new life, which affects him deeply. Naive where women are concerned, he often seems like a shy schoolboy when facing a pretty girl. He becomes involved with and marries Drusilla Alvarado, the beautiful granddaughter of a rich Spanish don. In the film adaptations he is portrayed by <a href=\"/wiki/Jeff_Osterhage\" title=\"Jeff Osterhage\">Jeff Osterhage</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Trivia\">Trivia</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Sackett&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Trivia\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The 1982 <a href=\"/wiki/Made_for_TV_movie\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Made for TV movie\">made for TV movie</a> <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Shadow_Riders_(film)\" title=\"The Shadow Riders (film)\">The Shadow Riders</a></i> was based upon another Louis L'Amour novel and stars <a href=\"/wiki/Sam_Elliott\" title=\"Sam Elliott\">Sam Elliott</a> (Dal Traven), <a href=\"/wiki/Tom_Selleck\" title=\"Tom Selleck\">Tom Selleck</a> (Mac Traven), and <a href=\"/wiki/Jeff_Osterhage\" title=\"Jeff Osterhage\">Jeff Osterhage</a> (Jesse Traven) in similar roles to those they play in <i>The Sacketts</i>.
