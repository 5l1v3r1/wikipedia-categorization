A nanodumbell is a pair of spheres attached together that may be made of silica or zinc oxide.   They have been used in a Purdue University experiment where they were made to spin in a vacuum at 60 billion rotations per minute.  The nanodumbbells are first created in the lab using a hydro-thermal process. The resulting dumbbell consists of two joined silica spheres, each about 320 nano-meters long and around 170 nano-meters wide.  Nanodumbbells are also being studied for possible use in photodynamic therapy, a way of treating cancer.  Highly focused circularly polarized light laser light bombards the levitated dumbbell to set it spinning.  The speed of  the rotation is a world record that beats previous records. In 2008, a small motor rotated at 1 million rotations per minute. In 2010, a slice of graphene was made to spin at 60 million spins per minute. Around 2013, a  sphere measuring just 4 micrometers was spun at 600 million spins per minute.
