The Irish Folklore Commission (Coimisiún Béaloideasa Éireann in Irish) was set up in 1935 by the Irish Government to study and collect information on the folklore and traditions of Ireland. It was founded and directed by James Hamilton Delargy, and concluded in 1971. Its roles were superseded by the Department of Irish Folklore in University College, Dublin which has since served as a repository of the data collected, including the Irish Folklore Collection. The commission also helped make recordings of the last original native speakers of Manx Gaelic on the Isle of Man which was declining in the 1960s but is becoming more popular again.
