  The School of Scottish Studies (Scottish Gaelic: Sgoil Eòlais na h-Alba, Scots: Scuil o Scots Studies) was founded in 1951 by Professor William Lindsay Renwick and is affiliated to the University of Edinburgh.  It holds an archive of over 9000  field recordings of traditional music, song and other lore, housed in George Square, Edinburgh. The collection was begun by Calum Maclean - brother of the poet, Sorley MacLean - and the poet, writer and folklorist, Hamish Henderson, both of whom collaborated with American folklorist Alan Lomax, who is credited as being a catalyst and inspiration for the work of the school.   From 1984 to 1995, the writer, singer and ethnologist, Margaret Bennett - mother of musician Martyn Bennett - worked for the school.  In 2012, Mòrag MacLeod, a researcher at the school for forty years, was awarded a Sàr Ghaidheal Fellowship for her contribution to Gaelic language and culture.  The collection of Scottish Gaelic folklorist Lady Evelyn Stewart Murray is held at the School. The collection documents the now dead Perthshire Gaelic dialect.
