In the musculoskeletal anatomy of the human head and neck, lateral to the incisive fossa is a depression called the canine fossa.  It is larger and deeper than the comparable incisive fossa, and is separated from it by a vertical ridge, the canine eminence, corresponding to the socket of the canine tooth; the canine fossa gives origin to the levator anguli oris.
