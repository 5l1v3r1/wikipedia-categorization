In physical anthropology, post-orbital constriction, often referred to as the post-orbital constriction index, is a narrowing of the cranium (skull) just behind the eye sockets (the orbits, hence the name), in primates â€” including primitive hominids. This constriction is very noticeable in non-human primates, slightly less so in Australopithecines, even less in Homo erectus and the most primitive Homo sapiens.  The post-orbital constriction index of archaic Homo species begins to fall within the range of modern Homo sapiens during the Mid-Pleistocene era.  In a departure from Homo erectus, Homo sapiens manifests a reduced post-orbital constriction due to increase in cranial capacity (about 1,350 cc), accompanied by higher cranial vaults. It completely disappears in modern Homo sapiens.  Thus, it is a useful, quantifiable measure of how far along the evolutionary path a hominid fossil might be placed. In species such as baboons and African great apes, an increase in the available capacity of the infratemporal fossa is simultaneously accompanied by a constriction in the sagittal plane.  As such, the anterior and posterior portions of the anterior temporalis muscle are inversely correlated in size, with the anterior being larger.  Although the temporalis muscle is used for chewing, there is no evidence that the supraorbital structure of primates is dependent upon their respective chewing habits or dietary preferences.  Post-orbital constriction is defined by either a ratio of minimum frontal breadth (MFB) behind the supraorbital torus divided by maximum upper facial breadth (bifrontomalare temporale, BFM) or as the maximum width behind the orbit of the skull.
