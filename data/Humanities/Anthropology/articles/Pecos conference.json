{"parse":{"title":"Pecos conference","pageid":11468374,"revid":775308942,"text":{"*":"<div class=\"mw-parser-output\"><p>The <b>Pecos Conference</b> is an annual conference of <a href=\"/wiki/Archaeologist\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Archaeologist\">archaeologists</a> that is held in the southwestern <a href=\"/wiki/United_States\" title=\"United States\">United States</a> or northern <a href=\"/wiki/Mexico\" title=\"Mexico\">Mexico</a>.\n</p><p>Each August, archaeologists gather under open skies somewhere in the southwestern United States or northern Mexico. They set up a large tent for shade, and then spend three or more days together discussing recent research and the problems of the field and challenges of the profession. In recent years, <a href=\"/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas\" title=\"Indigenous peoples of the Americas\">Native Americans</a>, avocational archaeologists, the general public and media organizations have come to speak with the archaeologists. These individuals and groups play an increasingly important role, as participants and as audience, helping professional archaeologists celebrate archaeological research and to mark cultural continuity.\n</p><p>First inspired and organized by <a href=\"/wiki/Alfred_V._Kidder\" title=\"Alfred V. Kidder\">A.V. Kidder</a> at <a href=\"/wiki/Pecos,_New_Mexico\" title=\"Pecos, New Mexico\">Pecos</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/New_Mexico\" title=\"New Mexico\">New Mexico</a>, in 1927, the Pecos Conference had no formal organization or permanent leadership until 2016. That year the conference joined Southwestern Archaeology Inc. and became a 501.c.3 nonprofit. Until then, professional archaeologists still found ways to organize themselves to meet at a new conference location each summer, mostly because they understand the problems of working in isolation in the field and the importance of face time with colleagues. To make progress with objective science and with other cultural matters, books and journal articles are important, but one still must look colleagues in the eye and work out the details of one's research in cooperative and contentious forums.\n</p><p>Open to all, the Pecos Conference remains an important opportunity for student archaeologists and avocational students of prehistory to meet with professional archaeologists on a one-on-one informal basis to learn about the profession, gain access to resources and new research opportunities, and to test new methods and theories related to archaeology. The conference features two days of papers, panels and discussion groups, as well as poster presentations, book sales and souvenirs. The Cordell-Powers Prize competition rewards young archaeologists, based on the quality of their presentations at the conference. A third day is devoted to tours of important archaeological sites, led by archaeologists who are working at that location or are highly knowledgeable about the area.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"External_links\">External links</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Pecos_conference&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: External links\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.pecosconference.org\">Official website</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://pecosconference.org/\">2017 Pecos Conference</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://pecosconference.com/\">2015 Pecos Conference</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.swanet.org/2014_pecos_conference/index.html\">2014 Pecos Conference</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.swanet.org/2013_pecos_conference/index.html\">2013 Pecos Conference</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.swanet.org/2012_pecos_conference/index.html\">2012 Pecos Conference</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.swanet.org/2011_pecos_conference/index.html\">2011 Pecos Conference</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.swanet.org/2010_pecos_conference/index.html\">2010 Pecos Conference</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://pecos.cortezculturalcenter.org/about.shtml\">2009 Pecos Conference</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://siris-archives.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?uri=full=3100001~!71915!0#focus\">Participants in First Pecos Conference 1927</a></li></ul>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw2274\nCached time: 20180919160901\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.008 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.012 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 10/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 0/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:11468374-0!canonical and timestamp 20180919160901 and revision id 775308942\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[{"lang":"ar","url":"https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D9%85%D8%A4%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%B1_%D8%A8%D9%8A%D9%83%D9%88%D8%B3","langname":"Arabic","autonym":"\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629","*":"\u0645\u0624\u062a\u0645\u0631 \u0628\u064a\u0643\u0648\u0633"}],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","*":"Science_conferences"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Archaeological_professional_associations"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Anthropology"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Alfred V.
