Immediately, the PAST team began building partnerships and programs for seamless education. The initial work in 2001 included a partnership with the <a href=\"/wiki/Science_Focus_Program_(Zoo_School)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Science Focus Program (Zoo School)\">Zoo School</a> from Lincoln, Nebraska, <a href=\"/wiki/Yellowstone_National_Park\" title=\"Yellowstone National Park\">Yellowstone National Park</a>, and PAST. The year-long program featured the first Thermal River archaeological investigation on the Marshall Hotel in the <a href=\"/wiki/Firehole_River\" title=\"Firehole River\">Firehole River</a> and culminated in a published book on the archaeology of the site garnering PAST the <a href=\"/wiki/National_Park_Service\" title=\"National Park Service\">National Park Service</a> <i>John L. Cotter Award</i> for Excellence in American Archaeology.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Marshall/Firehole_Article_1-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Marshall/Firehole_Article-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>For the next five years, PAST continued to partner with both public and private organizations building educational programs like <i>Riverboatin' on the Red</i> for Oklahoma's Department of Education and SCRUNCH for the <a href=\"/wiki/Minerals_Management_Service\" title=\"Minerals Management Service\">US Minerals Management Service</a>. Both programs pivoted around ongoing research such as the discovery of a shipwreck in the <a href=\"/wiki/Red_River_of_the_South\" title=\"Red River of the South\">Red River</a> dating to Oklahoma's early 19th century settlement period and the effects of pressure on Styrofoam cups that were taken down on the <a href=\"/wiki/Autonomous_Underwater_Vehicle\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Autonomous Underwater Vehicle\">AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle)</a> that studied World War II shipwrecks in thousands of feet of water in the Gulf of Mexico.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Deep_Wreaks/Scrunch_Article_2-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Deep_Wreaks/Scrunch_Article-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> These program-based learning projects that crossed disciplines have become the cornerstone of PAST.\n</p><p>In addition, PAST continued to partner with public agencies, universities, businesses, and industry building adult field study programs, anthropological research projects, and interactive websites. Years after their launch, websites for the <i>Deep Wrecks Project</i> and USS <i>Arizona</i> still have high volume visitation. The adult field schools have partnered with the <a href=\"/wiki/Ohio_State_University\" title=\"Ohio State University\">Ohio State University</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/California_Department_of_Parks_and_Recreation\" title=\"California Department of Parks and Recreation\">California State Parks</a>, the <a href=\"/wiki/Florida_Keys_National_Marine_Sanctuary\" title=\"Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary\">Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Nebraska_Wesleyan_University\" title=\"Nebraska Wesleyan University\">Nebraska Wesleyan University</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Oklahoma_Historical_Society\" title=\"Oklahoma Historical Society\">Oklahoma Historical Society</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Indiana_University\" title=\"Indiana University\">Indiana University</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/East_Carolina_University\" title=\"East Carolina University\">East Carolina University</a> providing participants with rigorous field experience and the partners with published reports and searchable databases.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Transition\">Transition</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=PAST_Foundation&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Transition\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In 2005, through a startup donation, PAST transitioned from a loose knit project driven organization to a program-based non-profit. Additionally, PAST moved the main office to Columbus, Ohio centrally located within the United States. The move allowed PAST to strategically address the organization's growth. Continuously on the quest to partner with schools to pilot PAST programs, in 2006 the foundation formed a partnership with the <a href=\"/wiki/Ohio_State_University\" title=\"Ohio State University\">Ohio State University</a>, the <a href=\"/wiki/Battelle_Memorial_Institute\" title=\"Battelle Memorial Institute\">Battelle Memorial Institute</a>, the Central Ohio Educational Council, and the innovative <a href=\"/wiki/STEM_fields\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"STEM fields\">STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math)</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/The_Metro_School\" title=\"The Metro School\">Metro Early College and Demonstration High School</a>, located on the OSU campus. Forming the <b>PAST/Metro Program Design Center</b>, PAST set about working with the high school faculty to design transdisciplinary programs that pivot on global issues. The very first program, <i>Garbology</i>, built on the work of <a href=\"/wiki/William_Rathje\" title=\"William Rathje\">Dr. William Rathje</a> of the <a href=\"/wiki/Stanford_University\" title=\"Stanford University\">Stanford University Archaeology Center</a> and pivoted on the very real, global issues of waste management, drew national attention and was rewarded the <i>Emerald Award</i> for Excellence in Environmental Education. The students, the program, and the project director, Dr. Sheli O. Smith, were bestowed with this award.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Metro_High_School_Garbology_Project_3-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Metro_High_School_Garbology_Project-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> \n</p><p>Employing STEM as a delivery vehicle for education, PAST has continued to build popular programs that excite students and allow teachers and students to join on an educational journey. From <i>Forensics in the Classroom</i> to <i>The Cultural Landscape of a Michigan Ghost Town</i>, from <i>The Web of Life</i> to <i>Get Real</i>, from <i>Marine Ecology of the Florida Keys</i> to <i>Growing America</i>, the PAST programs continue to draw on the anthropological base of the organization and to building holistic learning.\n</p><p>Utilizing the guidance of a strategic plan, PAST has been able to also grow on several other fronts. The PAST adult field schools, now in their ninth year, continue to study known <a href=\"/wiki/Archaeological_site\" title=\"Archaeological site\">archaeological sites</a> and collections assisting public agencies in better understanding, interpretation, and protection of America's maritime heritage treasures, as well as forging ahead in areas of anthropology. PAST field schools helped California Parks move forward in nominating the Gold Rush Era, shipwreck, <i>Frolic</i> on the Mendocino Coast for inclusion in California's State Underwater Parks. The 2005 through 2008 field schools assisted the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary in better understanding and interpreting the 19th century, Sanctuary shipwrecks, <i>Slobodna</i>, <i>Tonawanda</i>, and <i>Memanon Sanford</i>. Since 2006, PAST and partners have hosted a summer field program dedicated to allowing students to fully explore the world of <a href=\"/wiki/Forensic_anthropology\" title=\"Forensic anthropology\">Forensic Anthropology</a>. Similarly, PAST partnered with the respected documentary film program at Montana State University to offer teachers and students a summer practicum in documentary filmmaking that embeds the process in scientific projects.\n</p><p>In 2006, PAST sought out a new avenue of public access in order to bring the educational programs and field work and research to the public. PAST Publications utilizes the print-on-demand process to enable students, professionals, programs, and organizations to publish scientific and educational work in a timely and cost-effective way.\n</p><p>In 2007, after a year of working with STEM educational reform, PAST and the Battelle Center for Mathematics and Science Education Policy embarked on a combined, <a href=\"/wiki/Ethnography\" title=\"Ethnography\">ethnographic</a> and policy network study of STEM at Metro Early College and Demonstration High School.<sup id=\"cite_ref-PAST_Working_with_Battelle_on_STEM_School_Communities/Public_Networks_Study_4-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-PAST_Working_with_Battelle_on_STEM_School_Communities/Public_Networks_Study-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>  The interdisciplinary approach and findings of the study have added a new dimension to the national consideration of how STEM is developed.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Growth\">Growth</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=PAST_Foundation&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Growth\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Closing in on its first decade of operation, the PAST Foundation continues to be dedicated to the original goal of bringing public access to compelling scientific research. Currently, PAST works with emerging STEM schools across the US to build transdisciplinary programs for K-20 education and to better understand through anthropological ethnography, the underlying systems that make STEM successful. PAST continues to build learning programs for both high school age students and adults. The impact of these programs help drive their success. PAST Publications is also growing, helping graduate students publish their theses and academic institutions maintain the tradition of publishing research in a timely manner.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Awards\">Awards</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=PAST_Foundation&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Awards\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Since its establishment in 2000, recognition of PAST\u2019s achievements have steadily accumulated.

All PAST field opportunities are structured as a course with an authentic learning product that benefits the community. Field studies include supervised training, introduction to scientific techniques and methods, as well as organized presentation of field study results. Students have the opportunity to acquire high school and college credit for the field study programs. Field schools currently include work in cultural landscapes, underwater archaeology,  marine ecology, entomology, forensic anthropology, urban gardening, and documentary filmmaking.\n</p><p>Students are connected with leading professionals and researchers from around the world in person and through the Internet creating robust experiences and good practice science. All field programs explore real needs, engage community partners, and produce tangible outcomes that both assist the community partners and further the education of the participating students.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Research\">Research</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=PAST_Foundation&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Research\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Ongoing research is also key in the organization's interests.\n</p><p>The PAST Foundation supports new research and methodologies in linking field projects and researchers with educational programs in the classroom. Through the <b>PAST/Metro Program Design Center</b>, graduate students build upon their graduate research creating programs that are ultimately published for public consumption. <i>Forensics in the Classroom</i>, <i>the Web of Life</i>,  and <i>Growing America </i> are examples of ongoing, doctoral research that have been crafted into programs aimed at engaging young students in scientific methods and potential, lifelong careers.\n</p><p>Ongoing ethnographic studies of STEM are producing results intended to help schools better understand the universal structure that supports STEM delivery systems and how to successfully grow and sustain the necessary community and public networks that support it.\n</p><p>Research on the deepwater shipwrecks and other <a href=\"/wiki/Underwater_archaeology\" title=\"Underwater archaeology\">underwater archaeological</a> sites have spurred the PAST research team to initiate a web driven database that will allow researchers from around the world to share and compare information regarding historic ship construction details.
