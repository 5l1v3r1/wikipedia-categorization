Robert Leonard Carneiro (born in New York City on June 4, 1927) is an American  anthropologist and curator of the American Museum of Natural History.  Carneiro earned a Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in 1957.  Carneiro is an influential evolutionists (see, e.g., Sanderson, S. K. 2007. Evolutionism and its Critics: Deconstructing and Reconstructing an Evolutionary Interpretation of Human Society. Boulder, CO: Paradigm. P.161-171), he is especially known for his theory of the state formation ("Carneiro's Circumscription Theory") that explains how the constraints of the environment interact with population pressures and warfare to form states  (Carneiro, R. L. 1970. A Theory of the Origin of the State. Science 169: 733–738).  He has also made important contributions to the general theory of cultural evolution. He claims that in primitive war if the losers get away far enough then everything is quite fine. As seen with Ancient Egypt, when an area conquered along the Nile, the people can not just run off into the desert, therefore they are bound to their area, as seen with China, Iraq, etc. Carneiro, R.
