The Institute produced a journal series, <i>Edoth</i> (<a href=\"/wiki/Hebrew_language\" title=\"Hebrew language\">Hebrew</a>: \"Communities\"), of which only three volumes were published (the last one in May 1948). The Institute published a series of monographs as well and was a unique enterprise in <a href=\"/wiki/Mandatory_Palestine\" title=\"Mandatory Palestine\">mandatory Palestine</a>.\n</p><p>Having failed to receive a post at the <a href=\"/wiki/Hebrew_University\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hebrew University\">Hebrew University</a>, Patai pursued his own way in order to fill the void of ethnographic research carried out in Palestine. The Institute was formed after a series of discussions that took place in the Jerusalem community house. Patai was nominated as the Institute's director; the presidents of the Institute were Dr. Rabbi <a href=\"/wiki/Max_Grunwald\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Max Grunwald\">Max Grunwald</a>, who is recognized by many as the founder of the study of <a href=\"/wiki/Jewish_folklore\" title=\"Jewish folklore\">Jewish folklore</a>; Chief Rabbi <a href=\"/wiki/Ben-Zion_Meir_Hai_Uziel\" title=\"Ben-Zion Meir Hai Uziel\">Ben-Zion Meir Hai Uziel</a>, a leading figure of the Jerusalem <a href=\"/wiki/Sephardic\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sephardic\">Sephardic</a> community; <a href=\"/wiki/Yitzhak_Ben-Zvi\" title=\"Yitzhak Ben-Zvi\">Yitzhak Ben-Zvi</a> who later became Israel's second president.
