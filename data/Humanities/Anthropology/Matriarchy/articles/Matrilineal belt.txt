In anthropology the Matrilineal belt is an area in Africa south of the equator where matrilineality is predominant. The Matrilineal belt runs as a diagonal from the Atlantic to the Indian oceans crossing Angola, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique. The belt is linked to horticultural household economics, and Bantu groups that have embraced pastoralism have tended to lose matrilinearity.  The region stands out for its high degree of paternity uncertainty and adolescent promiscuity both of which are alledged to be linked to matrilinearity. As inheritance is mainly through the descent of women, there is little incentive to know the identity of the father of a child. Men's inheritance does therefore seldom pass to his wife's children but stays within what is for sure his biological family.    Ideas linking the Matrilineal belt to a supposed matrilineal Bantu expansion have been rejected as lacking evidence.
