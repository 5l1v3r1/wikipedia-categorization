Having first been proposed as an idea relating to ancient Greek religion in 1849, it subsequently achieved some support amongst classicists. In the early 20th century, various historians began to postulate about the theory applying across Europe, and it was widely propagated by the archaeologist <a href=\"/wiki/Marija_Gimbutas\" title=\"Marija Gimbutas\">Marija Gimbutas</a> in the 1980s. It has since been adopted by various feminist religious groups such as <a href=\"/wiki/Dianic_Wicca\" title=\"Dianic Wicca\">Dianic Wicca</a> as a part of the mythology of their faith.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Development_of_the_theory\">Development of the theory</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Great_Goddess_hypothesis&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Development of the theory\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The theory had been first proposed by the German Classicist <a href=\"/wiki/Eduard_Gerhard\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Eduard Gerhard\">Eduard Gerhard</a> in 1849, when he speculated that the various goddesses found in <a href=\"/wiki/Religion_in_Ancient_Greece\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Religion in Ancient Greece\">ancient Greek paganism</a> had been representations of a singular goddess who had been worshipped far further back into <a href=\"/wiki/Prehistory\" title=\"Prehistory\">prehistory</a>. He associated this deity with the concept of <a href=\"/wiki/Mother_goddess\" title=\"Mother goddess\">Mother Earth</a>,<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> which itself had only been developed in the 18th century by members of the <a href=\"/wiki/Romanticism\" title=\"Romanticism\">Romanticist Movement</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> Soon after, this theory began to be adopted by other classicists in France and Germany, such as Ernst Kroker, Fr. Lenormant and M.J. Menant, who further brought in the idea that the ancient peoples of <a href=\"/wiki/Anatolia\" title=\"Anatolia\">Anatolia</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Mesopotamia\" title=\"Mesopotamia\">Mesopotamia</a> had influenced the Greek religion, and that therefore they also had once venerated a great goddess.<sup id=\"cite_ref-hutton-36_3-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-hutton-36-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> These ideas amongst various classicists echoed those of the Swiss judge J.J. Bachofen, who put forward the idea that the earliest human societies were <a href=\"/wiki/Matriarchy\" title=\"Matriarchy\">matriarchal</a>, but had converted to a <a href=\"/wiki/Patriarchy\" title=\"Patriarchy\">patriarchal</a> form in later prehistory. Commenting on this idea, the historian <a href=\"/wiki/Ronald_Hutton\" title=\"Ronald Hutton\">Ronald Hutton</a> (1999) remarked that in the eyes of many at the time, it would have been an obvious conclusion that \"what was true in a secular sphere should also, logically, have been so in the religious one.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-hutton-36_3-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-hutton-36-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In 1901, the archaeologist <a href=\"/wiki/Sir_Arthur_Evans\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sir Arthur Evans\">Sir Arthur Evans</a>\u2014who in an 1895 work had dismissed the Great Goddess theory<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\u2014changed his mind and accepted the idea whilst excavating at <a href=\"/wiki/Knossos\" title=\"Knossos\">Knossos</a> on <a href=\"/wiki/Crete\" title=\"Crete\">Crete</a>, the site of the Bronze Age <a href=\"/wiki/Minoan_civilisation\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Minoan civilisation\">Minoan civilisation</a>. After unearthing a number of female figurines, he came to believe that they all represented a singular goddess, who was the Minoan's chief deity, and that all the male figurines found on the site represented a subordinate male god who was both her son and consort, an idea that he based partially upon the later classical myth of <a href=\"/wiki/Rhea_(mythology)\" title=\"Rhea (mythology)\">Rhea</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Zeus\" title=\"Zeus\">Zeus</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>  In later writings in ensuing decades he went on to associate these Neolithic and Bronze Age images with other goddesses around the <a href=\"/wiki/Near_East\" title=\"Near East\">Near East</a>. As Hutton pointed out, \"his influence made this the orthodoxy of Minoan archaeology, although there was always a few colleagues who pointed out that it placed a strain upon the evidence.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-hutton-36_3-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-hutton-36-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In 1903, Sir Edmund Chambers, a respected amateur historian of the mediaeval period, published <i>The Medieval Stage</i>, in which he diverted from his main theme to state how he believed that in prehistory, humans had worshipped a Great Earth Mother as a twofold deity who was both the creator and the destroyer.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources.

Harrison identified two of these as the Maiden, who ruled over the living, and the Mother, who ruled the underworld, and like Evans believed that a male god who was both her lover and son was also worshipped.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources.
