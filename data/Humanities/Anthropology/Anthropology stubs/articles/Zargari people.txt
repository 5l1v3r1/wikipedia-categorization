The Zargari people are a Romani-related ethnic group deriving from Zargar, Iran and neighboring villages. They speak a distinct Zargari dialect of the Romany language, most closely related to those of Rumelia.  Historical documentation of their origins is lacking, but one seemingly-accurate tradition traces their origins to three brothers, goldsmiths (Persian: زرگر‎, zargar), who were brought from Ottoman-held Rumelia as hostages during the reign of Nader Shah (1736-1747), and given pasture lands as a reward for their skills.  As Romani, they were also exempted from taxation and military service.  A late-19th century travel guide provides the only historical mention of the 'Zargari tribe', describing their propensity to road-piracy. Although the Zargari once consisted of several clans, most of these have dispersed and lost their native language. The residents of Zargar predominantly belong to the Pāsālār clan.
