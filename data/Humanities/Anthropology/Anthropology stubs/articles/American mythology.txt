American mythology is the body of traditional stories pertaining to America's most legendary stories and folktale, dating back to the late 1700's when the first colonists settled. "American mythology" may also refer to the modern study of these representations, and to the subject matter as represented in the literature and art of other cultures in any period. Stories from American mythology are the primary sources of inspiration for stories  and tall tales such as Bigfoot, Paul Bunyan, and The Lone Ranger.
