Hunting magic is the magic associated with hunting  in hunter-gatherer cultures, both contemporary and prehistoric. Walter Burkert in Homo Necans (1972) suggested that rituals associated with hunting magic are at the origin of religion. Henri Breuil interpreted the paleolithic cave paintings as   hunting magic, meant to increase the number of animals.
