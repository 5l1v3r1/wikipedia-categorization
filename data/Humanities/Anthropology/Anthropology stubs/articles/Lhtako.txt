Lhtako is the name of the tribe of Dakelh (Carrier) people who are today headquartered at Quesnel, British Columbia and incorporated under the Indian Act as the Red Bluff First Nation. Their southern neighbours are the T'exelc (Williams Lake) group of the Northern Secwepemc to the south, the Nazko people and Lhook'uz people to the west, the Tsilhqot'in peoples to the southwest, and the Lheidli Tenneh people to the north. Their territory borders with that of the Sekani on the northwest side of the Cariboo Mountains also. They are the southeasternmost of British Columbia's Athapaskan-speaking tribes. The band takes its name from Lhtakoh, the name in the Carrier language for the Fraser River,  in British Columbia, Canada.
