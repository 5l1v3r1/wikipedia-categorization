The Juggis, or Jughis, are members of an ethnic group of itinerant travelers found in north-central Afghanistan. They are looked down on by other local groups, and considered "as blots on the ethnic landscape." Many Juggis can be found living in makeshift camps and tents in the outskirts of Mazar-i-Sharif. Most Juggis claim to descend from travelers from Uzbekistan.  Edward Balfour noted a Muslim group known as Jughi in Bukhara, that he described in 1885 as gypsy-like, in which "women go unveiled, and the men are careless in their religious duties." The group was known for practicing medicine, fortune-telling and horse-trading, and wandered between Bukhara, Samarkand, and Karakul.
