The Human Behavior and Evolution Society, or HBES, is an interdisciplinary, international society of researchers, primarily from the social and biological sciences, who use modern evolutionary theory to help to discover human nature â€” including evolved emotional, cognitive and sexual adaptations.  It was founded on October 29, 1988 at the University of Michigan.  The official academic journal of the society is Evolution and Human Behavior,  and the society has held annual conferences since 1989.   As of 2015, the president is anthropologist Elizabeth Cashdan of the University of Utah. Past-president include biologist Randy Thornhill of the University of New Mexico and Mark Flinn of the University of Missouri. The president-elect is psychologist Robert Kurzban of the University of Pennsylvania.   The membership in broadly international, and consists of scholars from many fields, such as psychology, anthropology, medicine, law, philosophy, biology, economics and sociology.  Despite the diversity, HBES members "all speak the common language of Darwinism."
