The Mimika expedition (1935â€“1936) was a Dutch anthropological expedition to the western mountains of Central Dutch New Guinea to study the indigenous pygmy tribes. The specific aim of the expedition was to establish contact with the Tapiro, former name of the primitive pygmies living in the Mimika region, in Papua, Indonesia. Later anthropological work (1950s) was carried out with Mimiki people by Dutch Anthropologist Jan Pouwer.
