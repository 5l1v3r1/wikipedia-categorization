The Utinahica were a Timucua tribe and chiefdom in the 17th century. They lived in what is now the southeastern part of the U.S. state of Georgia. Their descendants may include the Creek Indians.  A Spanish mission, Santa Isabel de Utinahica, was established in the chief town of the Utinahica on the Altamaha River, near the present site of Jacksonville, Georgia, in the first half of the 17th century.
