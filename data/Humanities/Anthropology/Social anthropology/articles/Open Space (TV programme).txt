 Open Space was a programme produced by the BBC's Community Programme Unit. It was an evolution of the earlier Open Door  series of programmes allowing minority points of view to make a television programme about issues of concern to them.  The programmes were transmitted on BBC 2 in a mid-evening slot (Usually 8pm) and would attract audiences between 500,000 and 1,500,000.   In a typical year there would be two or three groups of up to eight Open Space programmes each usually half an hour long.  A producer, an assistant and (in 1990) a budget of up to £25,000 would be allocated to each programme. Vox Pops - The BBC’s Community Programme Unit -  Fred Johnson
