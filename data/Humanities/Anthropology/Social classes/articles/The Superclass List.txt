The Superclass List is a creation of David Rothkopf which his book Superclass: The Global Power Elite and The World They Are Making (publ. March 2008) is based upon. There are four key elements of success that unite the members of the Superclass, and gives them unparalleled power over world affairs. These elements are: geography, pedigree, networking and luck.  In the book Rothkopf writes that his list from 2008 contains 6,000 individuals. The grouping is, however, only defined roughly and as a statistical reality. Rothkopf also writes that list  (one in a million, globally), is always in flux. (Note, world population is now 6.9 - 7 billion. so, if published today, the list may contain 7,000 names) Rothkopf states that his list is not to be shown in public as there will be so much discussion about who does or does not qualify to be on the list. In interviews he mentions individuals that are on the list. This list contain names that he argues he has verified. About 20-30 Swedes are on the list.
