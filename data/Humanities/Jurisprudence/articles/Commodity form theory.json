The theory argues that the legal form is the parallel of the commodity form under <a href=\"/wiki/Capitalism\" title=\"Capitalism\">capitalist</a> society.\n</p><p>All law is concerned with the process of the exchanging of commodities between subjects who act as the \"guardians\" of commodities and are created by law in order to enable the commodity production form of society to function. The theory can be explained as based on two premises, logical and historical.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_logical_premise\">The logical premise</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Commodity_form_theory&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: The logical premise\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>\"Every legal relation\" proclaims Pashukanis, \"is a relation between subjects\". Pashukanis' conceptual account of law begins with the idea of a responsible agent - what he calls \"the legal subject\".\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Property\" title=\"Property\">Property</a>, says Pashukanis, is the basis of the legal form, but only capitalist property that can be disposed of in the <a href=\"/wiki/Market_(economics)\" title=\"Market (economics)\">market</a>. The subject in law is the expression of the freedom of property, that is, the freedom of alienate property.\n</p><p>Thus the key to understanding law is the contradiction between commodities and subjects.\n</p><p>Commodities according to <a href=\"/wiki/Karl_Marx\" title=\"Karl Marx\">Karl Marx</a> relate to each other as values, that is exchange takes place on the basis of equivalent amounts of labour-time embodied in commodities passing between buyers and sellers.\n</p><p>Contract is both logically the central legal premise on which all other aspects of law are based, and also the highest form of expression of the commodity owning subject. This is because it is the relations of contract that are crucial for commodity production society since the contract is the necessary legal expression of commodity owners' ability to use their commodities in the market. For Pashukanis, all other forms of legal relations in capitalism flow from this.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_historical_premise\">The historical premise</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Commodity_form_theory&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: The historical premise\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The commodity form of exchange historically precedes the legal system which emerges from it. But it is not merely that the commodity form produces the legal form; it is that the commodity form exists prior to the legal form and that only with the full development of the commodity form is there the possibility of a fully developed abstract legal form at all.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Fetishism\">Fetishism</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Commodity_form_theory&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Fetishism\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Commodity form theory is related to Marx's theory of <a href=\"/wiki/Commodity_fetishism\" title=\"Commodity fetishism\">commodity fetishism</a>. Marx argued that the commodity was a fetishized form because the formal equality that the commodity form postulated was only an apparent equality. The legal form is blind to substantive human differences, just as the commodity form is blind to substantive differences in use value. Ultimately, the legal form, just as the commodity form, exists independently of the will of the individual. The illusion is produced that the law&#160;\u2013 as the universal political equivalent&#160;\u2013 has a life of its own.\n</p><p class=\"mw-empty-elt\">\n</p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw2227\nCached time: 20180913220756\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.044 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.068 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 166/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 4735/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 183/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 12/40\nExpensive parser function count: 2/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\nLua time usage: 0.018/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 886 KB/50 MB\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   57.223      1 -total\n 75.71%   43.325      1 Template:Unreferenced\n 46.98%   26.882      1 Template:Ambox\n 24.11%   13.795      1 Template:Use_British_English_Oxford_spelling\n 19.19%   10.981      1 Template:DMCA\n 15.59%    8.922      1 Template:Dated_maintenance_category\n 10.03%    5.739      1 Template:FULLROOTPAGENAME\n  7.14%    4.086      1 Template:Ns_has_subpages\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:2493456-0!canonical and timestamp 20180913220756 and revision id 830046975\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"Commodity Form Theory","hidden":"","*":"Articles_lacking_sources_from_December_2009"},{"sortkey":"Commodity Form Theory","hidden":"","*":"All_articles_lacking_sources"},{"sortkey":"Commodity Form Theory","hidden":"","*":"Use_British_English_Oxford_spelling_from_March_2018"},{"sortkey":"Commodity Form Theory","*":"Communist_theory"},{"sortkey":"Commodity Form Theory","*":"Jurisprudence"}],"links":[{"ns":14,"exists":"","*":"Category:Articles lacking sources from December 2009"},{"ns":14,"exists":"","*":"Category:Use British English Oxford spelling from March 2018"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Capitalism"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Commodity fetishism"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Evgeny Pashukanis"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Jurisprudence"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Karl Marx"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Market (economics)"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Property"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Soviet Union"},{"ns":4,"exists":"","*":"Wikipedia:Citing sources"},{"ns":4,"exists":"","*":"Wikipedia:Verifiability"},{"ns":12,"exists":"","*":"Help:Introduction to referencing with Wiki Markup/1"},{"ns":12,"exists":"","*":"Help:Maintenance template removal"}],"templates":[{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Unreferenced"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Ambox"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Use British English Oxford spelling"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:DMCA"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Dated maintenance category"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:FULLROOTPAGENAME"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Ns has subpages"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Unsubst"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Message box"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:No globals"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Yesno"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Arguments"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Message box/configuration"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/data"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/config"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/shared"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/blacklist"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Namespace detect/data"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Namespace detect/config"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Ns has subpages"}],"images":["Question_book-new.svg"],"externallinks":[],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"The logical premise","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Commodity_form_theory","byteoffset":598,"anchor":"The_logical_premise"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"The historical premise","number":"2","index":"2","fromtitle":"Commodity_form_theory","byteoffset":1858,"anchor":"The_historical_premise"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Fetishism","number":"3","index":"3","fromtitle":"Commodity_form_theory","byteoffset":2246,"anchor":"Fetishism"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Commodity form theory","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"defaultsort","*":"Commodity Form Theory"},{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q5153164"}]}}
