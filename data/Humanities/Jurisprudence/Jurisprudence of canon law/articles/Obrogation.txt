It may also be the partial cancellation or amendment of a law, decree, or legal regulation by the imposition of a newer one. In the civil law, obrogation is the modification or repeal of a law in whole or in part by issuing a new law.    The 1983 Code of Canon Law governs here in Canon 53: If decrees are contrary one to another, where specific matters are expressed, the specific prevails over the general; if both are equally specific or equally general, the one later in time  obrogates (Latin: obrogat  from obrogare ) the earlier insofar as it is contrary to it.  This canon incorporates Rule 34 in VI of the Regulae Iuris: "Generi per speciem derogatur" or "The specific derogates from the general."
