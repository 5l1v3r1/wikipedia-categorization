Ibn al-Junayd al-Eskafi (َArabic: ابن الجنید الاسکافی) was one of the first eminent Shi'a jurists during the fourth century lunar hijrah. Abu Ali Muhammad ibn Ahmad Katib Iskafi (tenth century AD/fourth century lunar)  was born in Iskaf, a region near Nahrawan Canal  in Iraq.  His date of birth is uncertain. He may have traveled to Nishapur. He may have visited Muhammed Ibn Hosein Alavi. According to Shaykh Mufid's sayings, it seems that Ibn Jonayd passed most of his life in Baghdad. He may have had communication with the twelfth Imam. He took a different approach in understanding Shia traditions. He believed in a theological basis for interpretation of Hadith.  He believed that we must commit to Khabar Vahed and Qyas in jurisprudence. He acted like antecedent jurists such as Fazl ibn Shazan and Younes ibn Abdul Rahman. One of his characteristics in Fiqh discussion was that he believed  to Ihtiyat (probability) approximately in most problems. in other words, the principle of Ihtiyyat is prevalent in his juridical works.He employed other ideas in shia jurisprudence such as: His students include Shaykh Mufid, Ahmad ibn Abdoon, Shaykh TusiAandbul Abbas Najjashi.
