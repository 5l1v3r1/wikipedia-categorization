Therapy freedom is the freedom of physicians to apply whichever therapy their medical knowledge makes them believe to be appropriate. That often means: Therapy freedom, however, is limited to cases of no treatment existing that is both well-established and more efficacious. Therapy freedom is established in Germany, where it is known as Therapiefreiheit.
