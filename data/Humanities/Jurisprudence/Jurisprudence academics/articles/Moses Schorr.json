Moses was the oldest son of Osjasz Schorr, the director of the Jewish cooperative bank in Przemy\u015bl, and of Esther Schorr (n\u00e9e Friedman).

The institute, founded in October 1893 with the assistance of <a href=\"/wiki/Albert_von_Rothschild\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Albert von Rothschild\">Albert von Rothschild</a>, was modeled in part after the <a href=\"/wiki/Jewish_Theological_Seminary_of_Breslau\" title=\"Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau\">Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau</a>. At that time it had 11 teachers and 26 students preparing for the rabbinate. Among Schorr's teachers were Adolf Schwarz in Talmud and religious-ritual codes, David Heinrich M\u00fcller in Biblical <a href=\"/wiki/Exegesis\" title=\"Exegesis\">exegesis</a> and Semitic linguistics, Adolf B\u00fccher in Jewish history and <a href=\"/wiki/Meir_Friedman\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Meir Friedman\">Meir Friedman</a> in <a href=\"/wiki/Midrash\" title=\"Midrash\">Midrash</a> studies.

During his studies in Vienna, Schorr learned Hebrew and other oriental languages, showing particular interest in Egyptian mythology and psychology.\n</p><p>In 1898 Schorr attained the degree of Doctor of Philosophy and Medieval Studies at Lviv University.

Of his time teaching in Lw\u00f3w he wrote to Polish sociologist <a href=\"/wiki/Ludwik_Gumplowicz\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Ludwik Gumplowicz\">Ludwik Gumplowicz</a>:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p> ... For a long time I have not written to you of my old intentions to continue studying aiming at a dozent position. Besides, that \"spirit\" of semitology ... has not left me for a moment, haunting me as a shadow at every step. I have not lost contact with orientalistics, not for a bit. I have used every free minute to get acquainted with the ever growing literature, but unfortunately these free moments are quite rare. Professional work takes a lot of my time and causes a painful conflict between a forced, often mechanical work which I lack internal vocation for, and the results of my [oriental] studies ... On one hand, I do not want to be a charlatan in the profession, I even know that I have a certain mission as the religion teacher in Galicia and could even attain the \"laurels\" of the reformer in this subject. But I lack this specific ambition or enthusiasm. On the other hand, I am becoming convinced that I would have to study at least a year at the university (Berlin or Leipzig) so that I could independently work with Assyriology here. I have to admit for a moment that I have become a personality here, and everywhere they try to involve me in a friendly, humanitarian and scientific life ... and every day the circle of my \"social virtues\" widens itself \u2014 popular meetings, ceremonial speeches, committees, collectives <i>etc., etc.,</i> \u2014 all this distracts me from my work, as I see myself suddenly thrown into the whirl of life when I would like to remain still unknown among my co-confessors. As an unripened apple I am plucked from the tree and I still miss my tree \u2014 knowledge. As for the altruistic impulses, I think that I still have enough time to realize them ...                     Lviv, January, 1901</p></blockquote>\n<p>Schorr corresponded with a number of intellectuals of that time, including <a href=\"/wiki/Ludwig_Gumplowicz\" title=\"Ludwig Gumplowicz\">Ludwig Gumplowicz</a>, to whom he wrote at least 46 letters, and <a href=\"/wiki/Simon_Dubnow\" title=\"Simon Dubnow\">Simon Dubnow</a> in Odessa. His correspondence with Dubnow has not been studied yet.

He went to <a href=\"/wiki/Berlin\" title=\"Berlin\">Berlin</a> for two years where he studied Semitic languages, Assyriology, and the history of the ancient Orient under the guidance of famous scholars. In 1905\u20131906, he studied Arabic philology in Vienna under the guidance of semitologist David Heinrich M\u00fcller, who exerted a strong influence on Schorr. M\u00fcller taught Schorr Biblical criticism and Semitology at the Seminary, and a decade later, Arabic linguistics. M\u00fcller advanced a theory on the structure and form of the Biblical Psalms, which Schorr later developed in a series of articles.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Professor_at_Lviv_University\">Professor at Lviv University</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Moses_Schorr&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Professor at Lviv University\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In 1904 Schorr was appointed a lecturer as <a href=\"/wiki/Privatdozent\" title=\"Privatdozent\">privatdozent</a>, and in March 1910, associate professor of Semitic languages and history of the Ancient Orient at Lviv University, a chair which he later held in Warsaw.\n</p><p>In 1904\u20131905 he headed the <i>Toynbeehali</i>, the Society for the promotion of education among Jews in Lviv.

During his stay in Lviv, Schorr was one of the founders and the first head of the \"Society of the teachers of Moses religion of the people's secondary schools of Galicia\".

The Congress and his stay in Switzerland made an impression on Schorr, as he writes to Gumplowicz:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>There is no need to stress how strong an impression I got from the wonderful views of Swiss nature. I will stay here in Basel for 14 days for the whole duration of the 7th Zionist Congress, which is going to start on Thursday. Already today there are several hundred guests, most from Russia, among them the outstanding Jewish figures, and many ladies, as well. Already today, the Congress seems to me to be the most powerful manifestation of Jewish solidarity around the world. During the entire course of Jewish history, there was no such movement that would so deeply enter the consciousness of all the Jews with such an enthusiasm. But already nowadays various groups with different tendencies are being formed, away from the main fundamental idea.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Schorr took part in the conference but did not make any public speeches. Regarding the Zionist movement, he wrote:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>As for the Zionist movement ... I am noting in advance, that in my opinion the historical proofs can not be decisive for the present. After all, Professor Winkler proved that the Jews had never been to Egypt but does this mean that the Jewish religion, that is based on the fact of the Exodus of the Jews from Egypt and its consequences, should disappear from history?</p></blockquote>\n<p>\u017bebrowski presumes that Schorr's participation in the Congress was perhaps one of the reasons that a rich merchant, a banker and fervent Zionist, chose Schorr as a husband for his daughter Tamara. They were married in the synagogue of <a href=\"/wiki/Prussia\" title=\"Prussia\">Prussian</a> <a href=\"/wiki/K%C3%B6nigsberg\" title=\"K\u00f6nigsberg\">K\u00f6nigsberg</a> (modern Kaliningrad) on 31 October 1905.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Professor_in_Semitic_languages\">Professor in Semitic languages</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Moses_Schorr&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Professor in Semitic languages\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In April 1916 Schorr received the degree of merited professor of Lviv University in the field of Semitic languages and Ancient Oriental history, combining this post with other duties at the same university until 1923.

The B'nai B'rith \"Leopolis\" was founded in 1889 and since 1932 had its own building at 3 Maja street, 10. The archival documentation of B'nai B'rith \"Leopolis\" has been partially preserved and is still to be studied. From 1922 \"Leopolis\" was incorporated into the 13th district of B'nai B'rith Poland and numbered 217 persons, the largest lodge in Poland.\n</p><p>From 1921 Schorr was the president of the Lviv branch of B'nai B'rith in Galicia, part of the 12th district of B'nai B'rith Austria.\n</p><p>In 1922 Schorr was elected the vice president of the Polish district, while the president was  lawyer Dr Adolf Ader from Krak\u00f3w. From 1924 he was the president of the lodge <i>Braterstwo</i> (\"Brotherhood\") in Warsaw. This lodge numbered 85 members, including 32 merchants, 14 physicians, 13 engineers, eight lawyers, eight industrialists, six bankers, one writer, three senators (Moses Koerner, Schorr, and banker Rafael Szereszowski), one deputy (lawyer Dr Apolinary Hartgas) and two professors \u2014 Schorr and his close colleague, historian and friend Meir Balaban. The lodge reached its highest membership in 1931, when it had 130 members. After Schorr's resignation from its presidency, his role was taken over by Meir Balaban and consequently the lodge was headed by lawyer Maurycy Edelman, merchant Maurycy Meyzel, Seminary director Meir Tauber and lawyer Ignacy Bamberg.\n</p><p>The headquarters of Warsaw <i>Braterstwo</i> lodge were located at Rymarska 8 street. In the years of his presidency, Schorr organised many initiatives, undertakings, and cultural events, managed the meetings of so-called \"speaking diaries\" with the participation of renown personalities, writers and publicists. He took part in the creation of Auxilium Academicum Judaicum, an organisation formed for the erection of the Jewish Academic House in Warsaw. Schorr's brotherhood played a role in the founding of the Reform Institute of Judaic Sciences and the publishing society Menora that published the magazine <i>Miesi\u0119cznik \u017bydowski</i> (Jewish Monthly, 1930\u20131935), which was under the influence of B'nai B'rith. Through the Warsaw lodge, Schorr co-organised and supported the Relief Committee for the Jewish victims of the economic crisis, continuing his role in the religious affairs of the nomination of rabbis and Orthodox influences. While heading the Warsaw lodge, Schorr set up a special literary award for an outstanding writer of Jewish origin.\n</p><p>Rich members of the lodge played an important role in the charity activities of the lodege. Among them was a friend of Schorr, wood merchant Horacy Heller, who assigned for social activities 20,000 dollars. Significant sums were donated by his colleagues, banker Szereszowski (one of two Jewish colleagues in the Polish Senate), Dr. Joseph Landau, industrialist Maurycy Raabe, and others. In the years 1937\u20131938, a violent anti-Masonic campaign took place in Poland that led to the special decree of 1938 that dissolved any sort of free Masonic societies, including B'nai B'rith.\n</p><p>Moses Schorr performed the functions of vice president of the B'nai B'rith Lodge \"Solidano\u015b\u0107\" (Solidarity) in Krak\u00f3w. There are dozens of letters written by Schorr preserved in the B'nai B'rith collection of the State Archives in that city. During his presidency Schorr corresponded with a number of B'nai B'rith officials, including the Secretary of the Great Conventional Lodge in Chicago. Polish historian Dr Bogus\u0142awa Czajecka delivered a paper \"Moses Schorr as social activist in the light of B'nai B'rith documents (1922\u20131938)\" during the scientific session on Schorr at the Polish Academy of Arts in Krak\u00f3w in 1993.\n</p><p>Schorr's views on B'nai B'rith's goals and their practical application in terms of social activities are expressed in his work <span class=\"languageicon\">(in Polish)</span> \"Ideals of the Order B'nai B'rith and their Application Towards Real Life Conditions.\" Schorr describes B'nai B'rith as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p> ... The union of B'nai B'rith, as an international organization (...) is characterized by two fundamental principles: the idea of solidarity of all the Jews in the entire world (...), the idea of universalism of humanity, the brotherhood of all the peoples and nations (...). These two ideas I consider for the highest goal of our spiritual and intellectual program ... </p></blockquote>\n<p>Schorr's initiative helped with the creation of the Lodge \"Montefiory\" in <a href=\"/wiki/%C5%81%C3%B3d%C5%BA\" title=\"\u0141\u00f3d\u017a\">\u0141\u00f3d\u017a</a>, then the second largest Jewish urban community in Poland, with 222,497 Jews. In 1928 lodges \"Montefiore\" and \"Braterstwo\" took up the discussion concerning the official name of the organisation, arguing between B'nai B'riss and B'nei B'rith formulations. Schorr's suggestion \"...taking into consideration the scientific and practical views, the name of the order should be written \"B\u2019nei B\u2019rith\"  was adopted unanimously.\n</p><p>Schorr authored an appeal of the information bureau of the lodge \"Braterstwo\" about the situation of the Jews in Germany and other countries after <a href=\"/wiki/German_federal_election,_March_1933\" title=\"German federal election, March 1933\">1933</a>.

Schorr's historiographic approach and view upon the methodology applied to the study of the history of Polish Jewry is summarized in his own writing:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>The major defect of the methods of research of Jewish history in Poland is that the general issues were studied before the details had been exposed. There was attempt to present the history of the Jews in entire Poland, before this history had been reviewed in specific cities. The historical entireness was treated, before the elemental processes had been exposed. \nTherefore, also today's general works on the history of Polish Jewry, and they are few after all, are characterised by the dilettante forms, lacking integrity, accurateness and clarity in subject presentation. Their material used is meager and not sufficient to encompass the entirety of the history of Polish Jewry, neither in the political-economic sphere nor in the cultural developments. An appropriate solid basis for such a general task can only be constructed by virtue of the archival material, which is so abundantly accumulated in different archives and partially the libraries. The fundamental, scientific presentation of the entire history will only be possible when the factual historical, economic and cultural developments in the major cities will be multilaterally studied on the basis of archival sources. Publication and analysis of the archival documents should be the first task preceding the general studies.\"  \u2014 M. Schorr. Lviv, October 1902</p></blockquote>\n<p>The techniques and methods Schorr used in historical studies were far ahead of his young age (28) and the time in which he worked. He began his scientific work as an auditor in Vienna University in 1897 with his paper entitled <i>Zur Geschichte des Don Josef Nasi</i> (\"Concerning the history of Don Joseph Nasi\"), which was published in <i>Monatschrift fur die Wiessenschaft des Judenstum.</i> In this work he analyses the relations of <a href=\"/wiki/Joseph_Nasi\" title=\"Joseph Nasi\">Joseph Nasi</a> (1524-1579) with the Polish king <a href=\"/wiki/Sigismund_August\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sigismund August\">Sigismund August</a> (1520-1572) in light of the situation of Jews in Poland at that time. Joseph Nasi was a Portuguese born <a href=\"/wiki/Marrano\" title=\"Marrano\">marrano</a> (secret Jew) appointed the <a href=\"/wiki/Vassals_of_the_Kingdom_of_Jerusalem\" title=\"Vassals of the Kingdom of Jerusalem\">Lord of Tiberias</a> and the <a href=\"/wiki/Duchy_of_the_Archipelago\" title=\"Duchy of the Archipelago\">Duke of Naxos and the Seven Islands</a>. He was one of the first <a href=\"/wiki/Zionist\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Zionist\">Zionists</a> and an influential Ottoman statesman during the reign of <a href=\"/wiki/Selim_II\" title=\"Selim II\">Selim II</a> (1566\u20131574). Schorr analysed the relations of Joseph Nasi with Poland. Though he was a 20-year-old student at the time, he corrected a fundamental error of Graetz, a leading historian, who claimed that Sigismund August acknowledged a number of commercial privileges for the Polish Jews by virtue of the services of Joseph Nasi to Polish diplomacy at the Ottoman court. On the basis of sources found by Schorr in the historical city archives of Lviv, he came to the conclusion that Joseph Nasi was not guided by altruism but wanted the privilege to trade in Lviv for himself, and obtained it.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Doctoral_dissertation\">Doctoral dissertation</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Moses_Schorr&amp;action=edit&amp;section=24\" title=\"Edit section: Doctoral dissertation\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Schorr's doctoral dissertation, entitled <i>Organizacja \u017byd\u00f3w w Polsce</i> (\"The Organisation of Jews in Poland\"), was first published in Lviv's historical quarterly, <i>Kwartalnik historyczny</i> in 1899, and was later translated into Russian and published in <i><a href=\"/wiki/Voskhod_(magazine)\" title=\"Voskhod (magazine)\">Voskhod</a></i>. In 1903 Schorr was awarded the <a href=\"/wiki/Wawelberg\" title=\"Wawelberg\">Wawelberg Prize</a> (provided by the famous Polish-Russian banker and philanthropist) for his work <i>\u017bydzi w Przemy\u015blu do roku 1772</i> (\"Jews in <a href=\"/wiki/Przemy%C5%9Bl\" title=\"Przemy\u015bl\">Przemy\u015bl</a> until 1772\").

Schorr starts his historical account from the early 15th century, when the first Jews began to appear sporadically in significant numbers in the major cities of Czerwona Rus' <a href=\"/wiki/Red_Ruthenia\" title=\"Red Ruthenia\">Red Ruthenia</a>: Lviv, <a href=\"/wiki/Halych\" title=\"Halych\">Halicz</a>, Przemy\u015bl and <a href=\"/wiki/Sanok\" title=\"Sanok\">Sanok</a>. The first historical mention of Jews in Przemy\u015bl dates  from 1466, and Schorr included next a review of the privileges of <a href=\"/wiki/Sigismund_II_August\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sigismund II August\">Sigismund II August</a> (1548\u20131572); a <i>statute ad bonum ordinem</i> of <a href=\"/wiki/Stephen_B%C3%A1thory_of_Poland\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Stephen B\u00e1thory of Poland\">Stephen B\u00e1thory of Poland</a> (king of Poland from 1576 to 1586) and other privileges; contracts; antisemitic assaults; and documents about internal Jewish organisation. The last chapter deals with the Jewish professional brotherhoods, including Jewish artisan and tailor fraternities\u2014their emergence, organisation, and role in society. The author  notes Jewish religious societies such as the Society of Psalms Readers (whose task was gathering in synagogue each day before sunrise to recite the psalms) and the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Chevra_kadisha\" title=\"Chevra kadisha\">Chevra kadisha</a></i> (the holy society responsible for burying the dead). Schorr explores the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Pinkasim\" title=\"Pinkasim\">pinkasim</a></i> (books or journals) of the brotherhoods. He was the first to note the existence of Jewish artisan brotherhoods in that period after finding the records of the Przemy\u015bl guild of Jewish artisans from the 17th and 18th centuries. The wide usage of pinkasim for historical studies was innovative at that time.\n</p><p>Among the wide range of sources presented in the second part of the book we find the first fundamental privilege given by king Sigismund II August to the Jews of Przemy\u015bl in 1559, allowing them to live there with the same rights and freedoms as other townsmen (no. 1); the Order of Sigismund II August to the mayor and counselors regarding the attack on the Jews in 1561 (no. 2); the contract of 1595 between the town hall and Jewish elders on the matter of Jewish participation in the fortification of the city (no. 20); the protest of town pharmacists against the Jewish elders for the production of medical items by the Jews in 1677 (no. 121); the order of the governor of Rus' lands <a href=\"/wiki/Jab%C5%82onowski\" title=\"Jab\u0142onowski\">Jab\u0142onowski</a> allowing a free election of a rabbi after the ardent requests of \"unfaithful\" Jewish elders and the whole synagogue of Przemy\u015bl (no. 130). Several Polish sources from 1759 published in this edition (nos. 143 \u2013 144) deal with charges against the Jews of Stupnica in a supposed ritual Easter murder, their tortures and refusal of the charges, and the consequent execution of the accused. A similar Polish document (no. 76) from the year 1646 deals with charges of ritual child murder against twelve Przemy\u015bl Jews, one of whom was punished.

Schorr's works were mainly focused on these subjects from 1904. Schorr's switch to Oriental studies was caused partly by professional circumstances: Polish historian Krzysztof Pilarczyk notes that Schorr could not be assured of a professorship in the field of Jewish history in Poland. In 1902 Schorr became interested in the newly discovered <a href=\"/wiki/Hammurabi_Code\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hammurabi Code\">Hammurabi Code</a> and thus in the laws of Ancient Babylon and Assyria. Schorr's interest was rooted in his religious beliefs and interest in the Bible and Oriental and Egyptian mythology. His years at the gymnasium and university prepared him to study texts in the Hebrew, Assyrian, and Babylonian languages.\n</p><p>His first works in Oriental studies included a paper on the excavations and discoveries at <a href=\"/wiki/Amarna\" title=\"Amarna\">Amarna</a> (1900), followed by the investigation of <i>Staro\u017cytno\u015bci biblijne w swietle archiwum egipskiego</i> (\"Biblical Antiquities in the Light of the Egyptian Archive\"). This was published in the magazine <i>Przewodnik naukowy i literacki</i> in 1901 and separately as well. In 1903 Schorr commented extensively on <i>Babel und Bibel</i> (\"Babylon and Bible\"), a book by his former German tutor <a href=\"/wiki/Friedrich_Delitzsch\" title=\"Friedrich Delitzsch\">Friedrich Delitzsch</a> (1902). Schorr's commentary, \"Kultura Babilo\u0144ska a starohebrajska\" (\"Babylonian and Hebrew Culture\"), appeared in Lviv's <i>Kwartalnik historyczny</i> and later in a separate edition. <i>Kwartalnik Historyczny</i> was the major publication for Lviv historians at that time and Schorr was one of its regular contributors.\n</p><p>Some of Schorr's works were written and published in German, his second native language; German was then an official Habsburg language in Eastern Galicia, along with Polish and Ukrainian.

In this paper Schorr presents and discusses an ancient Babylonian text newly discovered by the Oxford Assyriologist <a href=\"/wiki/Stephen_Herbert_Langdon\" title=\"Stephen Herbert Langdon\">Stephen Herbert Langdon</a>.\n</p><p>He conducted research on the history of the social and commercial life of the Ancient Orient, and particularly trade in ancient Babylon. The work's title is <i>Ruch handlowy w Satoro\u017cytnej Babilonii</i> (\"The trade movement in old Babylon\"). It was published in 1911 in a commemorative book celebrating the 25th anniversary of the founding of Lviv University.\n</p><p>Schorr translated and systematised old Babylonian legal documents and wrote an extensive commentary entitled <i>Altbabylonische Rechtsurkunden aus der Zeit der I -ste Babylonische Dynastie</i> (\"Old Babylonian legal documents from the First Babylonian dynasty\"). The legal issues and the legal history of the laws were the main subjects of Schorr's research. He did significant research in comparative studies of the legal systems of Babylon and the surrounding cultures of that time, in particular the Hebrew legal system.\n</p><p><i>Kodeks Hammurabiego a \u00f3wczesna praktyka prawna</i> (\"The Hammurabi Code and Ancient Oriental Legal Practices\") first appeared in <i>Rozprawy</i> (Studies) of the historical department of Krak\u00f3w Academy of Sciences; in 1907 it was published separately.\n</p><p>Schorr's <i>Urkunden des altbabylonische Zivil- und Prozessrechts</i> (\"The Documents of the Old Babylonian Civil and Criminal Law) is considered to be his greatest scholarly achievement in the Oriental field.

He also initiated the centralized unification of all Jewish communities which created a new Collegio rabbinico italiano...in Florence...This seminary produced an array of young Rabbis, who started the spiritual renaissance of Italian Jewry.\"</p></blockquote>\n<p>Schorr's broadest article in <i>Chwila</i> was <i>Prawo Moj\u017cesza na tle por\u00f2wnawczem prawodawst Staro\u017cytnego Wschodu</i> (The Laws of Moses in Comparative Perspective with the Laws of the Ancient Orient\"). This work was a series of articles in several newspaper issues, where Schorr draws  comparisons between Biblical and Babylonian laws in the first part of the series, following with a comparison with the Assyrian and Hettite legislatures in the second and third sections.
