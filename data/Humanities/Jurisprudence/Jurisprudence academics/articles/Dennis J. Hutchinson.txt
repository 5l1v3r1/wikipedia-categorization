Dennis J. Hutchinson (born 1946) is a Senior Lecturer in Law at the University of Chicago, and Master of the undergraduate College's New Collegiate Division where he directs the Law, Letters, and Society program. His interests primarily lie in the field constitutional law, paying special attention to issues of race. Indeed, he is perhaps best known within the legal community at large for his work as Editor of the Law School's Supreme Court Review.  Hutchinson graduated summa cum laude from Bowdoin College, and studied briefly as a JD candidate at Chicago before attending  Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar in Jurisprudence, where he graduated with a BA and MA. Upon return to the United States, he completed his formal studies at the University of Texas Law School, where he took an LLM. Hutchinson then served as a law clerk to Justice William O. Douglas and Justice Byron White of the Supreme Court of the United States. His biography of Whizzer White  was a New York Times 'Notable Book' for 1998.  He was once married to Judge Diane Pamela Wood, who sits on the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, and who remains an academic colleague. Hutchinson was one of several law faculty members who were called upon by various media sources to provide commentary about President Barack Obama's tenure teaching constitutional law at the school, and was largely supportive.
