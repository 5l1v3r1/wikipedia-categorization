{"parse":{"title":"Regulation through litigation","pageid":2728620,"revid":789011588,"text":{"*":"<div class=\"mw-parser-output\"><p><b>Regulation through litigation</b> refers to changes in society (particularly those that affect industries) brought about by <a href=\"/wiki/Litigation\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Litigation\">litigation</a>, rather than <a href=\"/wiki/Legislation\" title=\"Legislation\">legislation</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Regulation\" title=\"Regulation\">regulation</a>.\n</p><p>Some critics of regulation through litigation cite the <a href=\"/wiki/Constitutional\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Constitutional\">constitutional</a> doctrine of <a href=\"/wiki/Separation_of_powers\" title=\"Separation of powers\">separation of powers</a>, arguing that rules that govern society as a whole should be rooted solely in laws enacted by legislative bodies.  By corollary, the <a href=\"/wiki/Judicial_branch\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Judicial branch\">judicial</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Executive_branch\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Executive branch\">executive branches</a> should properly be limited in their powers with regard to the law: the judicial in interpreting the laws, and the executive in enforcing the laws.  Critics of regulation through litigation include members of industry and public-service professions; some would argue that as potential <a href=\"/wiki/Defendants\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Defendants\">defendants</a>, their opposition is based more in self-interest than in policy concerns.  Of particular concern to critics is the use of the attorney general office to make policy, especially when that policy contradicts the policy of the chief executive; for example, many criticized <a href=\"/wiki/Attorneys-General_of_Mississippi\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Attorneys-General of Mississippi\">Mississippi Attorney General</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Jim_Hood\" title=\"Jim Hood\">Jim Hood</a> for his litigation against <a href=\"/wiki/Insurance\" title=\"Insurance\">insurance</a> companies in the wake of <a href=\"/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina\" title=\"Hurricane Katrina\">Hurricane Katrina</a> on the grounds that it undid the efforts of <a href=\"/wiki/Governor_of_Mississippi\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Governor of Mississippi\">Governor</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Haley_Barbour\" title=\"Haley Barbour\">Haley Barbour</a> to improve the business environment in the state.<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.pointoflaw.com/columns/archives/001699.php\">[1]</a>  In another example, eight state attorneys general unsuccessfully sued utility companies in an attempt to force implementation of <a href=\"/wiki/Global_warming\" title=\"Global warming\">global warming</a> standards that the federal government has refused to adopt.<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.pointoflaw.com/archives/001603.php\">[2]</a>\n</p><p>There are sometimes legislative efforts to prevent regulation through litigation.  Rep. <a href=\"/wiki/Rick_Boucher\" title=\"Rick Boucher\">Rick Boucher</a> (D-VA) argued in support of a 2005 federal <a href=\"/wiki/Tort_reform\" title=\"Tort reform\">tort reform</a> that gave immunity to gun manufacturers in certain lawsuits because such lawsuits were \"nothing more than thinly veiled attempts to circumvent the legislative process and achieve gun control through litigation\"; reform supporters complained that (and <a href=\"/wiki/The_Pentagon\" title=\"The Pentagon\">the Pentagon</a> supported the bill on the grounds that) the plaintiffs were trying to \"sue [gun manufacturers] out of existence\" through forcing them to incur $250 million in legal defense expenses, while <a href=\"/wiki/Gun_control\" title=\"Gun control\">gun control</a> supporters argued that the legislation took away \"...the right of victims to be able to have their day in court,\" that the bill gave unprecedented immunity to a single industry, and that the law was unconstitutional.<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-102005guns_lat,0,794784.story\">[3]</a>  \n</p><p>Some use the term \"regulation through litigation\" in a favorable sense.  For example, some laws have \"<a href=\"/wiki/Private_attorney_general\" title=\"Private attorney general\">private attorney general</a>\" provisions that permit individuals to file suit in court to vindicate important rights.  Many laws for addressing <a href=\"/wiki/Consumer_protection\" title=\"Consumer protection\">consumer protection</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Civil_rights\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Civil rights\">civil rights</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Employment_discrimination\" title=\"Employment discrimination\">employment discrimination</a> provide incentives for the private enforcement of laws by allowing the prevailing party to recover a reasonable <a href=\"/wiki/Attorney%27s_fee\" title=\"Attorney&#39;s fee\">attorney's fee</a>.\n</p><p>Regulation through litigation may at times overlap with <a href=\"/wiki/Judicial_activism\" title=\"Judicial activism\">judicial activism</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Regulation_through_litigation&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Hollow_Hope\" title=\"The Hollow Hope\">The Hollow Hope</a></i></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Tort_reform\" title=\"Tort reform\">Tort reform</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"External_links\">External links</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Regulation_through_litigation&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: External links\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Walter_Olson\" title=\"Walter Olson\">Walter Olson</a>, <i>Point of Law</i>, <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.pointoflaw.com/regulation/overview.php\">\"Regulation through Litigation\"</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Robert_Reich\" title=\"Robert Reich\">Robert Reich</a>, <i><a href=\"/wiki/USA_Today\" title=\"USA Today\">USA Today</a></i>, 11 February 1999, <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.prospect.org/webfeatures/1999/02/reich-r-02-11.html\">\"Regulation is out, litigation is in\"</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/American_Tort_Reform_Association\" title=\"American Tort Reform Association\">American Tort Reform Association</a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.atra.org/wrap/files.cgi/118_litigation.htm\">response to Reich</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/John_Fund\" title=\"John Fund\">John Fund</a> and Martin Morse Wooster, <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.heartland.org/Article.cfm?artId=8162\"><i>The Dangers of Regulation through Litigation: The Alliance of Plaintiff's Lawyers and State Governments</i></a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Books\">Books</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Regulation_through_litigation&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Books\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/W._Kip_Viscusi\" title=\"W.
