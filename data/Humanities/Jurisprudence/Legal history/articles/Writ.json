The complainant simply applied to the court for the writ most relevant to his complaint to be sent to the wrongdoer, which ordered him under royal authority to attend a royal court to answer for his actions.  The development was part of the establishment of a <a href=\"/wiki/Court_of_Common_Pleas\" title=\"Court of Common Pleas\">Court of Common Pleas</a>, for dealing with commonly made complaints by subjects of the crown, for example: \"someone has damaged my property\". The previous system of justice at the royal court of Chancery was tailor-made to suit each case and was thus highly time-consuming. Thus eventually the obtaining of a writ became necessary, in most cases, to have a case heard in one of the Royal Courts, such as the <a href=\"/wiki/Court_of_King%27s_Bench_(England)\" title=\"Court of King&#39;s Bench (England)\">King's Bench</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Court_of_Common_Pleas_(England)\" title=\"Court of Common Pleas (England)\">Common Pleas</a>. Some franchise courts, especially in the <a href=\"/wiki/County_Palatine\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"County Palatine\">Counties Palatine</a>, had their own system of writs which often reflected or anticipated the common law writs. The writ was \"served\" on (delivered in person to) the wrongdoer and acted as a command that he should appear at a specified time and date before the court specified in the writ, or it might command some other act on the part of the recipient.\n</p><p>Where a <a href=\"/wiki/Plaintiff\" title=\"Plaintiff\">plaintiff</a> wished to have a case heard by a local court, or by an <a href=\"/wiki/Eyre_(legal_term)\" title=\"Eyre (legal term)\">Eyre</a> if one happened to be visiting the County, there would be no need to obtain a writ. Actions in local courts could usually be started by an informal complaint. However, if a plaintiff wished to avail himself of Royal \u2014 and by implication superior \u2014 justice in one of the King's courts, then he would need a writ, a command of the King, to enable him to do this. Initially for <a href=\"/wiki/Common_law\" title=\"Common law\">common law</a>, recourse to the King's courts was unusual, and something for which a plaintiff would have to pay. For most Royal Courts, the writ would usually have been purchased from the <a href=\"/wiki/Court_of_Chancery\" title=\"Court of Chancery\">Chancery</a>, although the court of the <a href=\"/wiki/Exchequer_of_Pleas\" title=\"Exchequer of Pleas\">Exchequer</a>, being in essence another government department, was able to issue its own writs.\n</p><p>While originally writs were exceptional, or at least non-routine devices, <a href=\"/wiki/Frederic_William_Maitland\" title=\"Frederic William Maitland\">Maitland</a> suggests that by the time of King <a href=\"/wiki/Henry_II_of_England\" title=\"Henry II of England\">Henry II</a> (1154-1189), the use of writs had become a regular part of the system of royal justice in England.\n</p><p>At first, new writs were drafted to fit each new situation, although in practice the clerks of the Chancery would use wording from previously issued writs, with suitable adjustments, often taken from reference books containing collections of forms of writ, much as in modern times lawyers frequently use fixed precedents or boilerplate, rather than re-inventing the wording of a new legal document. The problem with this approach was that a plaintiff's rights and available forms of action at his disposal, would be defined, and in most cases limited, by the limited variety of writs available to him. Thus the power to create new writs was akin to the power to create new rights, a form of extra-parliamentary legislation. Moreover, a writ, if one could be found fitting the plaintiff's case, provided the legal means to remove the dispute from the jurisdiction of the local court, often controlled by a lesser <a href=\"/wiki/Nobility\" title=\"Nobility\">noble</a>, and instead have it heard by the King's judges. The nobility thus saw the creation of new writs as an erosion of their influence.\n</p><p>Over time, opposition to the creation of new writs by the Chancery increased. For example, in 1256 a court was asked to quash a writ as \"novel, unheard of, and against reason\" (Abbot of Lilleshall v Harcourt (1256) 96 SS xxix 44). Ultimately in 1258 the King was forced to accept the <a href=\"/wiki/Provisions_of_Oxford\" title=\"Provisions of Oxford\">Provisions of Oxford</a>, which among other things, prohibited the creation of new forms of writ without the sanction of the <a href=\"/wiki/Curia_Regis\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Curia Regis\">King's council</a>. New writs were created after that time only by the express sanction of Parliament and the forms of writ remained essentially static, each writ defining a particular <a href=\"/wiki/Form_of_action\" title=\"Form of action\">form of action</a>. It was the role and expertise of a <a href=\"/wiki/Solicitor\" title=\"Solicitor\">solicitor</a> to select on his client's behalf the appropriate writ for the proposed legal action. These were purchased from the court by payment of a fee. A <a href=\"/wiki/Barrister\" title=\"Barrister\">barrister</a> would then be hired by the solicitor to speak for his client in court.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Rationalisation_of_writs\">Rationalisation of writs</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Writ&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Rationalisation of writs\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>With the abolition of the Forms of Action in 1832 and 1833, a profusion of writs was no longer needed, and one uniform writ came into use. After 1852 the need to state the name of the form of action was also abolished. In 1875 the form of writ was altered so that it conformed more to the <a href=\"/wiki/Subpoena\" title=\"Subpoena\">subpoena</a> used in the Chancery. A writ was a summons from the Crown, to the parties to the action, with on its back the substance of the action set out, together with a 'prayer' requesting a remedy from the court (for example damages). In 1980 the need for writs to be written in the name of the Crown was ended. From that time, a writ simply required the parties to appear..<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Writs applied to claims that were to be heard in one of the courts which eventually formed  part of the <a href=\"/wiki/High_Court_of_Justice_of_England_and_Wales\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"High Court of Justice of England and Wales\">High Court of Justice</a>. The procedure in a <a href=\"/wiki/County_Court\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"County Court\">County Court</a>, which was established by statute, was to issue a 'summons'.\n</p><p>In 1999 the <a href=\"/wiki/Woolf_Reforms\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Woolf Reforms\">Woolf Reforms</a> unified most of the procedure of the Supreme Court and the County Court in civil matters. These reforms brought in the Civil Procedure Rules. Under these almost all civil actions, other than those connected with insolvency, are now commenced by the completion of a 'Claim Form' as opposed to the obtaining of a 'Writ', 'Originating Application', or 'Summons' (see Rules 7 and 8 of the Civil Procedure Rules).\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Writ_of_election\">Writ of election</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Writ&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Writ of election\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In some <a href=\"/wiki/Westminster_system\" title=\"Westminster system\">Westminster systems</a>, for example Canada and some other <a href=\"/wiki/Parliament\" title=\"Parliament\">parliamentary</a> systems, the phrase '<a href=\"/wiki/Dropping_the_writ\" title=\"Dropping the writ\">dropping the writ</a>' refers colloquially to a <a href=\"/wiki/Dissolution_of_Parliament\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Dissolution of Parliament\">Dissolution of Parliament</a> and the beginning of an <a href=\"/wiki/Election_campaign\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Election campaign\">election campaign</a> to form a new one.
