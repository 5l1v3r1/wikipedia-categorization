The Jvari inscriptions (Georgian: ჯვრის წარწერები) are the Georgian language inscriptions written in the Georgian Asomtavruli script on the Jvari Monastery, a basilica located near Mtskheta, Georgia.   The inscriptions mention Georgian princes Stephen I of Iberia, Demetrius the Hypatos and Adarnase I of Iberia. However, Professor Cyril Toumanoff disagrees with this view and identifies these individuals with Stephen II of Iberia, Demetrius and Adarnase II of Iberia, respectively. Inscriptions are dated to the 6th-7th centuries.
