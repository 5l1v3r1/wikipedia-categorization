The Umm Leisun inscription (Georgian: უმმ ლეისუნის წარწერა) is the Georgian language limestone tombstone slab inscription written in the Georgian Asomtavruli script which was discovered in 2002, after the renewal of 1996  excavation, at a Georgian monastery of the Byzantine period, in the neighborhood of Umm Leisun, 4.5 km southeast of the Old City of Jerusalem,  found in a burial crypt under the polychrome  mosaic floor.  In total about 24 interments were discovered in the crypt.  Per sex estimation for human skeletons, all of them were adult males, as would be expected in a monastery.  The occupant of the most important tomb identified by a Georgian inscription was a "Georgian bishop Iohane" (John in Old Georgian), who was also the oldest and his age underlined his special status.  He would have been aged 66 or 67 when he died, and had suffered from osteoporosis.  The inscription is the earliest known example for an ethnonym ႵႠႰႧႥႤႪႨ (kartveli i.e. Georgian) on any archaeological artifact, both in the Holy Land and in Georgia.   The inscription covers an area of 81 × 49 cm cut into the tombstone. It is dated to the end of the 5th or the first half of the 6th century AD.  The inscription is kept at the Archaeological Garden of Knesset.  ႤႱႤႱႠႫႠႰႾႭჂ ႨႭჀႠႬႤႴႭჃႰ ႲႠႥႤႪႤႮႨႱႩႭႮႭ ႱႨႱႠჂႵႠႰႧႥႤ ႪႨႱႠჂ
