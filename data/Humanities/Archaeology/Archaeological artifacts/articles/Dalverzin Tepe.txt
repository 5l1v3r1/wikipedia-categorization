Dalverzin Tepe is an ancient archaeological site located in the northern part of the region of Bactria, southern modern Uzbekistan, about 120 km north-east of Termez. It is the location of Hellenistic constructions made during the time of the Greco-Bactrians, perhaps a small fortress. In the first century BC it grew to a substantial city. The place flourished especially under the Kushan Empire. The city was well organised with quarters for the administration, for religious buildings, living quarters and industrial areas. In one of the houses was found a treasure hoard of many golden objects. After the 3rd century the city declined. Coordinates: 38°06′04″N 67°51′38″E﻿ / ﻿38.10111°N 67.86056°E﻿ / 38.10111; 67.86056
