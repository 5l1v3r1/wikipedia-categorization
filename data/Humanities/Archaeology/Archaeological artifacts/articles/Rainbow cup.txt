Rainbow cup (German: Regenbogenschüsselchen, Czech: duhovka from duha - rainbow) is a term for Celtic gold coins found in areas once dominated by the La Tène culture. According to folk belief, Rainbow cups could be found where a rainbow touched the earth and could often be found in ploughed fields after heavy rainfall. They were thought to bring luck and had many different effects ascribed to them.
