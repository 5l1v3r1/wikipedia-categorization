Charles Diehl (French: [dil]; January 19, 1859 – November 1, 1944) was a French historian born in Strasbourg. He was a leading authority on Byzantine art and history. He received his education at the École Normale Supérieure, and later taught classes on Byzantine history at the Sorbonne. He was member of the École française de Rome (1881–1883) and the École française d'Athènes. In 1910 he became a member of the Académie des inscriptions et belles-lettres (elected president in 1921).  The Karolou Dil Street in the city of Thessaloniki (Greece) was named after Charles Diehl, near the Byzantine church of Hagia Sophia that was restored by him between 1907 and 1909. Diehl was the author of several influential books on Byzantine art and history. His treatise "Byzance. Grandeur et décadence" was translated into English by Naomi Walford and published in 1957 as "Byzantium: Greatness and Decline".  Other published works by Diehl include:
