Pierre Jérôme Honoré Daumet (23 October 1826, Paris – 12 December 1911, Paris) was a French architect. Daumet was the winner of the Prix de Rome in 1855, and in 1861 conducted a treasure-hunting expedition to Macedonia at the request of Napoleon III, accompanying the archaeologist Léon Heuzey.  On his return he married the daughter of architect Charles-Auguste Questel. Daumet founded his own atelier which would produce nine further Grand Prix winners, Charles-Louis Girault chief among them, and attracted a number of foreign students such as Charles McKim and Austin W. Lord.   In 1908 Daumet won the Royal Gold Medal of the Royal Institute of British Architects. Major work includes:
