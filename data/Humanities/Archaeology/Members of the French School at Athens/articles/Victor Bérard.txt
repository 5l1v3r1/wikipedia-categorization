Victor Bérard (French: [beʁaʁ]; Morez, 10 August 1864 – Paris, 13 November 1931) was a French diplomat and politician. Today, he is still renowned for his works about Hellenistic studies and geography of the Odyssey.  Bérard's "L'Angleterre et l'impérialisme" was translated into English and published in 1906 as "British imperialism and commercial supremacy" (Longmans, Green, London, New York).
