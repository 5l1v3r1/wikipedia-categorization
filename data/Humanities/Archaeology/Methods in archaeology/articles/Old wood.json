{"parse":{"title":"Old wood","pageid":8332633,"revid":844690936,"text":{"*":"<div class=\"mw-parser-output\"><p>The <b>old wood effect</b> or <b>old wood problem</b> is a pitfall encountered in the <a href=\"/wiki/Archaeology\" title=\"Archaeology\">archaeological</a> technique of <a href=\"/wiki/Radiocarbon_dating\" title=\"Radiocarbon dating\">radiocarbon dating</a>. A sample will provide misleading or confusing results if materials of different ages are deposited in the same <a href=\"/wiki/Archaeological_context\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Archaeological context\">context</a>. \n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Stratification_(archeology)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Stratification (archeology)\">Stratification</a> is not always clear-cut in practice. In the case of dating megalithic tombs, indirect evidence for the age of the tomb must always be obtained, because stone (or the time of moving a stone) can not be dated. When a number of objects are recovered from one deposit, the <a href=\"/wiki/Terminus_post_quem\" title=\"Terminus post quem\">terminus post quem</a> is based on the dating from the 'youngest' find. Even though other items in the same stratum indicate earlier dates, they may have been deposited at the same time. The deposit must be as young, or younger than the youngest object it contains. Thus excavators look to <a href=\"/wiki/Post_hole\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Post hole\">post holes</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pit\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikt:pit\">pits</a>, or find spots under the <a href=\"/wiki/Orthostat\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Orthostat\">orthostats</a> for clues to construction dates. The possibility that something (organic) was already in situ must always be considered, especially if the results appear suspiciously early. \n</p><p>The old wood problem can appear in <a href=\"/wiki/Marine_archaeology\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Marine archaeology\">marine archaeology</a>. Researchers need to check if stumps from a <a href=\"/wiki/Mesolithic\" title=\"Mesolithic\">Mesolithic</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Palaeolithic\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Palaeolithic\">Palaeolithic</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Submerged_forest\" title=\"Submerged forest\">submerged forest</a> are to be found in the area. (If they do, the possibility of one sticking up through, e.&#160;g., a shipwreck and giving misleading dates must be considered.)\n</p><p>Organic samples which are not derived from the same part of an organism, may show dating variations which blur and obscure the interpretation being attempted. If compelling archaeological reasons for supposing that the ages come from exactly contemporary samples do not exist, then results must be regarded as suspect.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> If there exists no prior reason to believe that two samples are truly of the same age, and even if their ages are statistically indistinguishable, they are as likely to be as far apart in true age as the measured difference between them as they are to be of the same age.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Charcoal\" title=\"Charcoal\">Charcoal</a> was seen historically as an ideal medium for carbon dating. When long-lived tree species, such as <a href=\"/wiki/Oak\" title=\"Oak\">oak</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Juniper\" title=\"Juniper\">juniper</a>, are used, however, there is a particular danger of encountering the \"old wood\" problem. For example, the date being measured may be from <a href=\"/wiki/Heartwood\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Heartwood\">heartwood</a>, which is already many centuries old by the time the tree was felled. Another difficulty is that of a possible time-lag between felling and final deposition. The timber may have had an extensive history of use and re-use. A method of ameliorating this problem is to date young growth, if available, for example <a href=\"/wiki/Hazel\" title=\"Hazel\">hazel</a> twigs.\nDating of artefacts using <a href=\"/wiki/Accelerator_Mass_Spectrometry\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Accelerator Mass Spectrometry\">Accelerator Mass Spectrometry</a> is the gold standard dating method of today; charcoal-sourced dates are seen as unreliable. In establishing the chronology of a site, a representative spread of dates is required before interpretation can be attempted.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Notes\">Notes</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Old_wood&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Notes\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><i>Discovering Our Past: A Brief Introduction to Archaeology.</i> Second Edition.
