Corpus Speculorum Etruscorum is an international project with the goal to publish all existing Etruscan bronze mirrors. The first three volumes were published in 1981. A total of thirty-four fascicles has been produced. The first major systematic study of Etruscan mirror was Eduard Gerhard's Etruskische Spiegel. The work consists of five volumes published between 1843 and 1897 (the final volume being published after Gerhard's death). In 1973 a decision was made to make a new publication that could replace Gerhard's outdated work.  Deutsche Demokratische Republik Bundesrepublik Deutschland  1. CSE Hongrie, Tchécoslovaquie. J.G.
