The museum conserves and displays artifacts from the 13th archaeological site. The origins of the museum date back to excavations undertaken at the 13th site in 1990.  The 13th Site Museum was built in 1998.  It includes a "Bridge of Time" or Tijd Brug, that allows visitors to travel back through time to explore its civilization and culture. In 2017, the museum became the first museum exhibiting its artifacts outside Taiwan when they held an exhibition in Miyazaki Prefecture, Japan at the Saitobaru Archaeological Museum displaying 105 artifact sets from the museum in Taiwan. The exhibition was jointly organized by scholars and experts from both sides.  The museum is located at the foot of Guanyin Mountain near Däamzui, old Dutch administrative region (see Dutch Red Haus, Fort Äarmmo-Schee). The archaeological site dates back from 1,800 years ago (Iron Age). The architecture of the museum has an archaeological theme, reflecting ancient civilization in Taivan (Taiwan) islandwide and in its outlying minor islands. The museum is accessible by bus from Guandu Station of Taipei Metro.
