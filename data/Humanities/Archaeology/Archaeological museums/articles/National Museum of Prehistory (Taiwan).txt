In 1980, during the construction of the South-Link Line, building work uncovered prehistoric remains on the Peinan Site (卑南遺址).  Many slate coffins and artifacts were discovered, and after a proposal by the Taitung City Government, construction of Taitung Station was halted. For 10 years, a National Taiwan University-led team excavated the 10,000 m2 (110,000 sq ft) site and uncovered over 1,500 burials and tens of thousands of artifacts.  The site is widely regarded as the most important site of the mid-Neolithic age in Taiwan, and was then later transformed into the Beinan Cultural Park. An outdoor museum was proposed and approved in 1990. Trial operations began on July 10, 2001, and the museum officially opened on August 17, 2002.   The museum was designed by American architect Michael Graves and is situated on a 10 ha (100,000 m2) parcel of land.  The museum is divided into several sections, including: The museum is accessible within walking distance from Kangle Station of the Taiwan Railway Administration.
