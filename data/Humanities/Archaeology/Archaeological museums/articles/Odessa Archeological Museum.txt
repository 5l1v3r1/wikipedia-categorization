The Odessa Archaeological Museum is one of the oldest archaeological museums in Ukraine. It was founded in 1825; the current museum building was completed in 1883. Since 1997, the Odessa Archeological Museum has functioned not only as a museum but also as an institute for scientific research into the archeology of primitive society in the Northern Black Sea region and the archeology of the Middle Ages. The museum conducts expositions, restorations and publishing activities. The museums has a collection size of more than 160,000: archeological finds from the northern Black Sea region, the largest collection in Ukraine of Ancient Egyptian sarcophagi, stone slabs with hieroglyphics and fragments of papyrus, Ancient Greek and Ancient Roman exhibits. The museum is also famous for its collection of coins and medals. There are over 50,000 coins in the museum treasury from Ancient Greece, Ancient Rome, the Byzantine Empire, Ancient Kievan Rus and coins of the Russian Empire from the Romanovs' dynasty.  A few years ago the Leventis Foundation of Cyprus funded the new Greek and Cypriote gallery at the museum; because of the large number of Greeks in Odessa in the 19th century, the museum has rich collections of material from both areas. The museum's address is 4 Lanzheronovskaya Street, 65026, Odessa, Ukraine
