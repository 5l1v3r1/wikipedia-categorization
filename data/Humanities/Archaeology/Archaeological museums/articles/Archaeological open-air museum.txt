 An archaeological open-air museum is a non-profit permanent institution with outdoor true-to-scale architectural reconstructions primarily based on archaeological sources. It holds collections of intangible heritage resources and provides an interpretation of how people lived and acted in the past; this is accomplished according to sound scientific methods for the purposes of education, study and enjoyment of its visitors. The above definition was made by EXARC, using ICOM's definition of museums. By that time Roeland Paardekooper was their director. Further explanation of its components: Examples of archaeological open-air museums are Flag Fen, Biskupin, Lake Dwelling Museum Unteruhldingen, Saalburg, Colonial Williamsburg, Plimoth Plantation, Craggaunowen, West Stow Anglo-Saxon village, Butser Ancient Farm, Havr√°nok, the Scottish Crannog Centre and the Eindhoven Museum.
