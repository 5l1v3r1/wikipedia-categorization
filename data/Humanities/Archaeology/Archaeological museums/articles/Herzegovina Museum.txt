The Herzegovina Museum is a museum in Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina containing items associated with the history of the area.  The museum was established in 1950 with the purpose to find, collect, keep and present the cultural and historical heritage of Mostar and Herzegovina.  It is housed in the former home of Džemal Bijedić, the head of the Yugoslav Government who died in a plane crash in 1977. The building, constructed during the Austrian-Hungarian period, is an example of a mixture of architectural features between the Austrian-style dwelling and Oriental residency. The Herzegovina Museum owns a collection of archaeological and ethnographic exhibits, as well as documents supplying information on the various periods of the city of Mostar and Herzegovina. It also features antique furniture and historical objects of daily use.
