Rhind Lectures are a series of lectures on archaeological topics. They have been hosted by the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland since 1874. The content of the lectures is usually published in journals or expanded into new works by their authors. The name commemorates Alexander Henry Rhind, whose bequest to the society funded this lectureship. Rhind directed that his estate be used for this purpose, once the interests of living parties was extinguished, which took place 11 years after his death in 1863.  The speaker and subject is selected years in advance, allowing the speaker to give a detailed exposition of a topic in their area of expertise. The Rhind Lectures have continued into the 21st century, and since 2009 the society has published a video file that is freely available to the public.  The total number of lectures in the series in 2012 was 133.
