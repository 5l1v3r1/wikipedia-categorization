The Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Society was founded in 1853,  and is one of the largest county-based archaeological societies in the United Kingdom.  It runs the Wiltshire Heritage Museum in Devizes, Wiltshire which has the best Bronze Age collections in Britain, including finds from Avebury and Stonehenge. It also publishes the Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Magazine.  A history of the society was published in 1953, under the title The Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Society: 1853-1952: a centenary history.  As well as continuing to publish an approximately annual journal, the Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History magazine, the Society has in the past published books of Wiltshire interest, such as the Tropenell Cartulary.  The present-day Wiltshire Record Society began life as the Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Society Records Branch.
