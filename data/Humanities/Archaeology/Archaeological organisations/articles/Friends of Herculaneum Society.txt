The Friends of Herculaneum Society  is an Oxford-based British charity founded in 2004 to promote research into the archaeological site of Herculaneum at Ercolano, near Naples, Italy. Its headquarters are in the Ioannou Centre for Classical and Byzantine Studies.  The Society's members are particularly interested in the Villa of the Papyri and in the possibility of finding a hitherto unknown library or libraries in the unexcavated lower levels of that structure. More than 1800 Herculaneum papyri were discovered in Herculaneum in the 18th century, and it is hoped that many more may yet be discovered, including a Latin library containing hitherto lost classics. Members of the Society come from all walks of life. Its membership is not exclusive to scholars as it includes all those interested in Herculaneum, the Villa of the Papyri and Ancient Rome in general.
