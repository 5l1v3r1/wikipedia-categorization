The Société des Antiquaires de France (Society of Antiquaries of France) is a Parisian  historical and archaeological society, founded in 1804 under the name of the Académie celtique (Celtic Academy).  It is now based at the Louvre, in the pavillon Mollien. The Académie celtique was founded by prefect Jacques Cambry, Jacques-Antoine Dulaure and Jacques Le Brigant on 9 germinal Year XII (30 March 1804), with the goal of studying Gallic civilization and French history and archaeology.  Cambry was its first president, until his death in 1807.  In 1813 it changed its name to the Société des Antiquaires de France, after the Society of Antiquaries of London, and from 1814 to 1848 it changed again to the Société royale des antiquaires de France under the Bourbon Restoration.  According to the regime in France, it was then called the Société impériale des antiquaires de France or Société nationale des antiquaires de France, but it re-assumed its present name in 1871, and has not changed it since. Since its foundation it has published a collection of Mémoires, and of Bulletins, as well as an annual directory of its members. The site of the Société nationale des Antiquaires de France publishes prosopographical records of its members among which are:
