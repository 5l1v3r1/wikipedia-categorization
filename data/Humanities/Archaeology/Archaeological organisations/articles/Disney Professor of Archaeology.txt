The Disney Professorship of Archaeology is an endowed chair in archaeology at the University of Cambridge. It was endowed by John Disney in 1851 with a donation of £1,000, followed by a further £2,500 bequeath upon his death in 1857.  The last three Disney Professors have also served as the Director of the McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research.
