The Dyfed Archaeological Trust is one of the four Welsh Archaeological Trusts established in the mid-1970s with the charitable object 'to advance the education of the public in archaeology'.  Its core area comprises Carmarthenshire, Ceredigion and Pembrokeshire (the old county of Dyfed) in south-west Wales.  The Trust provides archaeological and related advice to central government, local planning authorities and other public and private organisations. It maintains the regional Historic Environment Record. Data included in the Historic Environment Record are publicly available on a dedicated website, Archwilio. The Trust also undertakes a wide range of field- and office-based projects, is a limited company and a registered charity.
