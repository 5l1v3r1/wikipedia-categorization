The Greater London Industrial Archaeology Society  (GLIAS) is the  industrial archaeology society for the Greater London area. Founded in 1968  by individuals who had been involved in the Thames Valley Observation Group, it quickly established itself as the leading industrial archaeological and industrial history group in the London Area. It is a member of the South East Regional Industrial Archaeological Conference, the Association for Industrial Archaeology, and the TICCIH.  It also works together with more locally directed history groups and projects supporting individual conservation projects, as well as raising industrial historical issues with national UK organisations such as English Heritage and the Royal Fine Art Commission. In addition it comments on planning applications and developments likely to have an effect on the survival of industrial structures.  In this remit it acts as a statutory consultee. Its membership is crossed with many other similar organisations and bodies that have similar objectives such as the King's Cross Conservation Area Advisory Committee, the Newcomen Society and the Association for Industrial Archaeology. Every year it organises a series of half-a-dozen lectures (held in Central London) on industrial archaeology.  It provides a bi-monthly newsletter, which is still produced as hard copy in an A4 Gestetner form. It also hosts a series of popular walks around sites of industrial archaeological importance in London, often hosted by people who are expert about the matters in question. An occasional journal is produced. In the early 1990s  AIA developed a national standardised method for collecting industrial archaeology data. The result was the IRIS (Index Record for Industrial Sites) booklet and forms, published in 1993. In 1998, GLIAS began to develop a database which  could used to record site information in London.          The intention was to make the database compatible with the IRIS data standard, and the first version was essentially an electronic IRIS form. An early version was demonstrated to a special committee of the society, the  Recording Group  and this was later presented to the AIA. This was favourably  received and the database has been in development ever since. In 2002 the society received  an award from them.
