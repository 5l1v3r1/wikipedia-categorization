Current Publishing is a British magazine publishing company based in Chiswick, London. Current Publishing was founded in 1998.  The company now publishes three titles: Current Archaeology, Current World Archaeology, and Military History Monthly, in addition to several online services dedicated to archaeology, heritage, and sites of historical significance. Current Publishing was founded by Andrew Selkirk, a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries and former Vice-President of the Royal Archaeological Institute, who launched the first magazine, Current Archaeology, in 1967.  For its first 40 years, the publication was bi-monthly, becoming a monthly in 2007 up until the present day.  Current Archaeology now has over 17,000 subscribers worldwide.  Current World Archaeology was launched in 2003, with an international focus on archaeology from the first emergence of man down to the present day.  There are six editions published per year. Military History Monthly is the latest magazine to be added to Current Publishing’s roster, and was launched in October 2010 as Military Times before obtaining its current title in November 2011.  It is edited by Neil Faulkner, and covers all aspects of military history, from battles of the ancient world, up to more recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.  There are 12 editions published each year. In addition to the physical publications, Current Publishing has several websites intended to complement the magazines with further information and discussion forums. I Love the Past is a review-driven heritage website, ‘dedicated to viewing and reviewing historic houses, castles, museums and archaeology fieldwork around Britain’.
