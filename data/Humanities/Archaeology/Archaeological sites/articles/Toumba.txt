In archaeology the term Toumba stands for mounds covering Bronze and early Iron Age settlements in Greece. At first they were considered as Grave hills, hence the name that derived from the word Tomb. However excavations showed that they are not tombs but structures like settlements, religious centers, or homes located at different depths depending on their date of use, like tells. A Toumba found in Assiros was the site of a burial, but it contains evidence of being used as a granary. It contained, among other things, a hearth, storage space, and cereal straw.   Similarly, a Toumba in Macedonia was found to contain fragments of processed cereal grains. These have been dated to 2100-1900 BC.
