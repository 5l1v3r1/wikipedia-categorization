Published in 2007, B端rgin's book Der Urzeit-Code (The Primeval Code), is a popular science book dealing with a patent granted in 1980 to the chemical company Ciba-Geigy (now Novartis), which deals with the process of electroculture, which helped to increase the resilience of crops and reduce the use of pesticides on treated crops. The book details reports and interviews that document the effect of the electroculture process which had not been previously explained scientifically. In the book, B端rgin presents electroculture as a more ecologically-friendly alternative to genetic engineering. 1. https://web.archive.org/web/20121105104612/http://tatjana.ingold.ch/index.php?id=goetterspuren 2. http://literaturtest.net/text/buch/rezensio/b/buergin.html 3.
