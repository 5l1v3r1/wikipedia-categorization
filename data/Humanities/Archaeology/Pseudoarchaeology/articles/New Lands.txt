New Lands was the second nonfiction book of the author Charles Fort, published in 1923.  It deals primarily with astronomical anomalies. Fort expands in this book on his theory about the Super-Sargasso Sea – a place where earthly things supposedly materialize in order to rain down on Earth – as well as developing an idea that there are continents above the skies of Earth.  As evidence, he cites a number of anomalous phenomena, including strange "mirages" of land masses, groups of people, and animals in the skies.  He also continues his attacks on scientific dogma, citing a number of mysterious stars and planets that scientists failed to account for. Of all of Fort's books, New Lands is the worst-regarded.  His speculations (serious or joking, he does not reveal) concerning continents in the sky and the supposed top-like shape of the Earth have dated considerably. New Lands is available in Dover Publications' The Complete Works of Charles Fort with Fort's other paranormal writings, and an edited online version is linked below.
