It is located in the La Paz Department, Manco Kapac Province, Copacabana Municipality In Incan society, the societal structure was very rigid. Often those of belonging to the royal class structure did not mix with the lower classes.  Iñaq Uyu dates back to around 1000 C.E. to 1500 C.E.  Like the other archaeological sites, Chinkana and Pillkukayna, Iñaq Uyu is located on an island of Lake Titicaca; however, Iñaq Uyu is situated on the Isla de la Luna, rather than the larger Isla Del Sol where Chinkana and Pillkukayna are situated. The name, Iñaq Uyu, has a linguistic origin that speculates that the cemetery was probably used as a burial site for the Incan women of noble and aristocratic hierarchy. Iñaq Uyu’s name roughly translates to “house of the virgins of the sun".  This name may have been given because Iñaq Uyu is situated on the Isla de la Luna and away from the Isla Del Sol. Because Iñaq Uyu is away from the Isla Del Sol, it can be considered as a “virgin of the sun.”.
