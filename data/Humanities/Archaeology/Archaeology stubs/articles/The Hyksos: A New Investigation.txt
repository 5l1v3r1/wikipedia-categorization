The Hyksos: A New Investigation is a book by John Van Seters published in 1966 by Yale University Press.  The main contribution of this volume is a careful linguistic analysis by Van Seters in which he argues that the Ipuwer Papyrus does not belong to the First Intermediate Period of Egyptian History (c. 2300-2200 BCE), as previously thought, but rather to the Second Intermediate Period (c. 1700-1600 BCE). Van Seters' case has not been universally accepted by Egyptologists, who continue to suggest a range of dates for the composition of Ipuwer.
