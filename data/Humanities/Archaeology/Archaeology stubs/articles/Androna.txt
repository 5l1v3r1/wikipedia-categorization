Androna, also known as al-Andarin is a Byzantine site spread over a vast area at the edges of the semi-desert, about 25 kilometers beyond the more well-known Byzantine site of Qasr Ibn Wardan.  Androna was built as a defense line against nomadic skirmishes in the Syrian Desert. The fortified city contains many churches, palaces and baths;  and was famous for its vineyards and high-quality wine in which it was mentioned by Amr ibn Kulthum in his ode.    The following is the opening verse of his ode: أَلاَ هُبِّي بِصَحْنِكِ فَاصْبَحِيْنَـا وَلاَ تُبْقِي خُمُـوْرَ الأَنْدَرِيْنَـا‎ Ha girl! Up with the bowl! Give us our dawn draught And do not spare the wines of al-Andarina During the Syria Civil War, ISIS captured this archaeological sites on 18 January 2018 from HTS and was captured by the Syrian army on 6 February.
