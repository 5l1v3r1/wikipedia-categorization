Georges Laplace (fr), 1958 (broader-than-modern meaning)  The Epigravettian (Greek: epi "above, on top of", and Gravettian) was one of the last archaeological industries of the European Upper Paleolithic. It arose after the Last Glacial Maximum around ~21,000 cal. BP. It is related to the Gravettian, of which it is considered a continuation by some scholars (e.g. G. Laplace). In this sense, the Epigravettian is simply the Gravettian after ~21,000 BP,[is this date calibrated?] when the Solutrean had replaced the Gravettian in most of France and Spain.  Its known range extends from southeast France to the western shores of the Volga River, Russia, with a large number of sites in Italy. It was replaced by Mesolithic cultures around 10,000 BP.
