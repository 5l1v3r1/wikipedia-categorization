La Ciudad is a Hohokam people archaeological site in Phoenix, Arizona excavated by Frank Midvale 1929-1936.  It is covered today by St. Luke's Medical Center.     Much of the archaeological material in the Heards' collection at the Heard Museum came from the La Ciudad Indian ruin, which the Heards purchased in 1926 at 19th and Polk streets.
