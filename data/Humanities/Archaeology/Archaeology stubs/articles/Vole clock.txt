The Vole clock is a method of dating archaeological strata using vole teeth. Investigations at sites across Europe have allowed construction of a detailed framework of how different vole species evolved over the last million years, and where and when specific species became extinct.  For many sites it is considered the most accurate way of dating, and also provides information on the climate and local environment e.g. in the Pleistocene.  Dr. Francis Wenban-Smith of Southampton University, a Stone Age specialist on assignment for Oxford Archaeology, described the Vole clock as "one of the wonders of modern science".
