The Charlie Lake Cave (Tse'KWa) is an archaeological site in the Canadian province of British Columbia . Its Borden System designation is HbRf 39 . In a waste pit in front of the small cave artifacts up to 10,500 years old have been found, which are considered to be the oldest evidence of ritual acts in Canada. The cave is located a few kilometers north of Fort St. John, near Charlie Lake. No artifacts were found in the cave itself, which measures is 45 m × 6 m (148 ft × 20 ft), but in a kind of waste pit in front of the cave entrance, they go back up to 11,000 years, including a fluted point, six retouched flakes and a small bone bead.
