Las ﾃ］imas complex is an archaeological culture of northern Chile considered to be the immediate precursor to the Diaguita culture.   The culture developed in the Chilean region of Norte Chico between 800 and 1000 CE.  Prior to Las ﾃ］imas complex, an archaeological culture known as El Molle complex existed in Norte Chico from 300 to 700 CE.  Pottery recovered from Las ﾃ］imas complex has linear designs painted with white, red or black.  The black colour derives from specular hematite.  Las ﾃ］imas complex has the earliest evidence for copper metallurgy in Norte Chico.
