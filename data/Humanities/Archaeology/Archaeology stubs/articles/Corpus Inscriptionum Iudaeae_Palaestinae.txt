Corpus Inscriptionum Iudaeae/Palaestinae (CIIP) is a corpus of  all ancient inscriptions from the fourth century BC to the seventh century CE discovered in Israel. Inscriptions are in ten different languages, including  Hebrew, ancient Greek, Latin, Phoenician, Aramaic, Syriac and Nabatean. The seven volume series documents inscriptions from Jerusalem, Caesarea and the northern coastal plain, Jaffa and the southern coastal plain, Ein Gedi and Masada, Galilee.  The researchers partners are Prof. Hannah Cotton, Chair of Classics at the Hebrew University, Prof. Jonathan Price from Tel Aviv University and a team of German researchers led by Professors Werner Eck and Walter Ameling. The project began in 1999 and is mostly funded by the German Research Foundation, which gave the project a million euros.
