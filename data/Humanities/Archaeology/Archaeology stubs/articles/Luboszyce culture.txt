Luboszyce culture – a culture of East-Germanic tribe of Burgundians, developed in the areas between Odra (Oder) and Laba (Elbe) in Central Europe, in the late period of Roman influences (2-4th century). The name derives after an important archaeological site in Luboszyce (Liebesitz) near Gubin in Lubuskie Voivodship in Poland. The people of the culture originally settled in the area of the present Polish and German Lusatia (Luzyce, Lausitz), gradually expanding its range to the North-West part of Lower Silesia (Dolny Śląsk, Nieder Silesia), south Brandenburg and Lubusz land (Ziemia Lubuska), and East Saxony (Sachsen).
