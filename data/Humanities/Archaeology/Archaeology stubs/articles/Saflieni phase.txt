   The Saflieni phase is one of the eleven phases of Maltese prehistory. It is named for the Ħal-Saflieni Hypogeum, an underground temple complex now recognised as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.  The Saflieni phase, from approximately 3300-3000 BCE,  follows the Ġgantija phase and precedes the Tarxien phase in the Temple period, and is one of the three phases during which the principal megalithic temples of Malta were built.
