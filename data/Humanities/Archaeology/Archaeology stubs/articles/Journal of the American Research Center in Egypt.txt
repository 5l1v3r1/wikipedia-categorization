The Journal of the American Research Center in Egypt (JARCE) is an academic journal published by the American Research Center in Egypt. It was established in 1962 to publish research into the art, archaeology, languages, history, and social systems of the Egyptian people. As is usual for Egyptological journals, it accepts articles written in English, French, or German. Over the years a number of Egyptologists have served as editor-in-chief. In 2008, Eugene Cruz-Uribe (California State University, Monterey Bay) succeeded Ann Macy Roth (Howard University) as editor.
