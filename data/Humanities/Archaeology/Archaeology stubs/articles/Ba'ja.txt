Ba'ja (Arabic: بعجة‎) is a Neolithic village 14 kilometres (8.7 mi) north of Petra, Jordan. Like the nearby site of Basta, the settlement was built in c. 7000 BC, during the PPNB (Pre-Pottery Neolithic B) period. Ba'ja lies at an altitude of around 1,160 metres (3,810 ft), and is only accessible with a climbing route through a narrow, steep canyon.   Near the entrance to the site is Ba'ja I, an Islamic settlement with 2-3 layers of an older Nabataean settlement.
