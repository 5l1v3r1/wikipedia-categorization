The Iron Gates Mesolithic is a Mesolithic archaeological culture, dating to between 11,000 and 3,500 years BCE, in the Iron Gates region of the Danube River, in modern Romania and Serbia. Major sites within this archaeological complex include Lepenski Vir. Stages at this site dated at c. 6300â€“6000 BCE have been described as "the first city in Europe",  due to its permanency, organisation, as well as the sophistication of its architecture and construction techniques.   Lepenski Vir consists of one large settlement with around 10 satellite villages. Numerous piscine sculptures and peculiar architecture have been found at the site.
