Excavation pits were dug 6 meters deep revealing many artifacts from Roman times, timber piles that were recorded as to be from 59 AD to 83 AD that was used for buildings during the first London Bridge, and Medieval floors.  The Archaeologists continue excavating the site for more artifacts around the 16th and 18th centuries.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup></li>\n<li><b>Victorian Era</b> Archaeologists in London have discovered a railway infrastructure near the London tube station created by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, an engineer that is well known for his invention approximately 200 years ago called the Broad-Gauge Great Western Steam Railway.  The area has evidence of seven foot-wide broad gauge train tracks and buildings from the 1850s.  At the moment, Archaeologists are further researching the site with laser scanning technology for more artifacts of the Victorian-era railway.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>  They are also using a series of 3D models of the architecture of the 1850s buildings in order to identify paths of the railway.</li>\n<li><b>Derbyshire</b> In May 2013, a group of archaeologists have discovered what is believed as the oldest railway tunnel at Derbyshire in England (United Kingdom.) The tunnel lies on the route of the Butterley Gangroad, a horse-operated railway built by 1793 to link the Cromford Canal with the limestone quarries at Crich.  The line closed in 1933 after being open for over 100 years and the tunnel was sealed up 50 years later in the 1980s.  Trevor Griffin, who is project managing the work for the Derbyshire Archaeological Society, said he thought the tunnel could be older than the one regarded as the world's first - which is also in Derbyshire.  He said: \"The tunnel that was currently generally considered to be the world's oldest was on the Peak Forest Tramway and was built in 1795.\"  The two-year project began in January. The society worked with Wessex Archaeology to reopen the tunnel and made a three-dimensional computer model of the interior using laser scanning.  Written evidence suggested the railway was operating by 1793 and Mr Griffin says they were able to prove the line must have run through the tunnel. The Butterley Gangroad, which was engineered by Benjamin Outram, was modernised in the 1840s and turned into a narrow gauge railway.  When the work is completed, the tunnel will be sealed up for further preservation.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Railway_archaeology&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Railpage_Australia&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Railpage Australia (page does not exist)\">Railpage Australia</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Omoto_locomotive_dump\" title=\"Omoto locomotive dump\">Omoto locomotive dump</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Railway_archaeology&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https://www.networkrail.co.uk/archaeological-finds-at-london-bridge-station/\">https://www.networkrail.co.uk/archaeological-finds-at-london-bridge-station/</a></span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-2\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.culture24.org.uk/history-and-heritage/archaeology/art500045-victorian-railway-infrastructure-discovered-by-archaeologists-near-london-tube-station\">http://www.culture24.org.uk/history-and-heritage/archaeology/art500045-victorian-railway-infrastructure-discovered-by-archaeologists-near-london-tube-station</a></span>\n</li>\n</ol></div></div>\n<dl><dt>Sources</dt></dl>\n<ul><li>Nock, O.S  1981  <i>Railway Archaeology</i>, Book Club Associates/Patrick Stephens Ltd.</li>\n<li>http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-derbyshire-22342239</li></ul>\n<p><br />\n</p>\n<table class=\"metadata plainlinks stub\" role=\"presentation\" style=\"background:transparent\"><tbody><tr><td><a href=\"/wiki/File:Aiga_railtransportation_25.svg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Stub icon\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Aiga_railtransportation_25.svg/19px-Aiga_railtransportation_25.svg.png\" width=\"19\" height=\"29\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Aiga_railtransportation_25.svg/29px-Aiga_railtransportation_25.svg.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Aiga_railtransportation_25.svg/38px-Aiga_railtransportation_25.svg.png 2x\" data-file-width=\"314\" data-file-height=\"472\" /></a></td><td><i>This rail-transport related article is a <a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub\" title=\"Wikipedia:Stub\">stub</a>.
