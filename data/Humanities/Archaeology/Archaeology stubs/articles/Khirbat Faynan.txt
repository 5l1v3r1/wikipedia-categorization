Khirbat Faynan, also known as Phaino, is an archaeological site in Wadi Faynan, southern Jordan. Located at the confluence of Wadi Dana and Wadi Ghuwayr, the settlement was occupied from the early Bronze Age  and has been identified with the biblical Punon, one of the stations of the Exodus. In the Roman-Byzantine period, it was the centre of the area's extensive copper mining complex, the largest in the Southern Levant.
