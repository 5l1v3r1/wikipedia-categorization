Madjedbebe or Malakunanja II is a rock shelter in Arnhem Land, in the Northern Territory of Australia. It is about 50Â km from the coast.  Madjedbebe was first occupied by humans around 65 thousand (at least 59.3 thousand) years ago.   This is the oldest known site showing the presence of humans in Australia. This date sets a new minimum age for: the arrival of humans in Australia, the dispersal of modern humans out of Africa and the subsequent interactions of modern humans with Neanderthals and Denisovans. More than 1500 items have been found in the shelter, including stone tools and grinding stones, ochre, and charcoal. Some of these were buried more than 2.5 metres below the surface. The shelter also includes faded paintings on the walls. The paintings are drawn with ochre. Archaeobotanical investigations have demonstrated a clear exploitation of plant foods, including: seeds, tubers and pandanus nuts. Fuel wood was also sourced from a local eucalyptus and moonson vine thicket forest.
