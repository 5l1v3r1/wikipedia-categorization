The Venus figurines of Gagarino are eight Palaeolithic Venus figurines made from ivory. The statuettes belong to the Gravettian industry and are about 21,000â€“20,000 years old. They were discovered near to the village of Gagarino in Lipetsk Oblast, Russia, and are now held in the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg.   The Figurine No. 1 (by Abramova 1962) is sculpted similar to the Venus of Willendorf: The depicted female body is naked and obese, which is not necessarily interpreted as pregant.   The small arms are at the side with no hands. The face is not depicted, but a headgear or a hairstyle is indicated. The breasts are heavy. The mons veneris is indicated.
