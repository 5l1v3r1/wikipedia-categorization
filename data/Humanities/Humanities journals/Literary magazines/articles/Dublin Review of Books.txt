The Dublin Review of Books (drb) is an Irish review of literature, history, the arts, and culture. The magazine publishes long-form essays exploring themes related to newly published books; shorter, more conventional book reviews; blog entries on a wider variety of topics; and short extracts from books that highlight their broader arguments.  Established in 2006, the drb launched its first full issue as an online quarterly review in Spring 2007. Founded and jointly edited by Enda O'Doherty, an Irish Times journalist, and Maurice Earls, the proprietor of Books Upstairs bookshop in Dublin, it is consciously modelled on its near-namesakes, the New York Review of Books and the London Review of Books.  The magazine aims to provide writers with a forum to develop their arguments and share knowledge in longer review-essays than those found in conventional newspapers and magazines.  Along with The Dublin Review, The Honest Ulsterman, The Stinging Fly, and various other titles, it is one of a number of periodicals to have contributed to a boom in Irish literary journals over the past decade.  Since Autumn 2012, the drb has been published fortnightly online, with additional material published between each issue in the form of shorter blog posts.  Since the magazine's inception, many notable writers, poets, academics, diplomats, and politicians from Ireland and further afield have contributed to it.  Previous contributors have included:
