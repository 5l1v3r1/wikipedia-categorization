Eye to the Telescope is a quarterly online journal of the Science Fiction Poetry Association,  which publishes  speculative poetry, including science-fiction, fantasy, horror, and poetry.  It was established in 2011.  It is a theme-based periodical  with rotating editors. The first issue, in May 2011, had the theme "The Long and Short of Speculative Poetry," and featured both short poems, including haiku, tanka, and other short poems, contrasted with long poems. It was edited by Samantha Henderson and Deborah P Kolodji. Since then the journal's editors are selected by the current SFPA president and change with each issue; as a result, editorial policies change with each issue as well.
