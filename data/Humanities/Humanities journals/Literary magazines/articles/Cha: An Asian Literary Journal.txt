Cha: An Asian Literary Journal is the first Hong Kong-based online English literary journal. It was founded in 2007, a decade after the handover, by Tammy Ho Lai-Ming and Jeff Zroback. The editorial team also includes Reviews Editor Eddie Tay. The journal publishes poetry, fiction, creative non-fiction, book reviews, and photography & art from and about Asia. Although Cha is primarily interested in Asia-related creative works and works by Asian writers and artists, it also publishes works by writers and artists from all over the world. In its first anniversary issue (November 2008), for example, former Poet Laureate of the United States Billy Collins contributed four Asian-themed poems. Other former contributors to the journal include, among others, Ai Weiwei, Louie Crew, Duo Duo, Eleanor Goodman, Ma. Luisa Aguilar Igloria, Alan Jefferies, Sushma Joshi, Christopher Kelen, Shirley Lim, Lyn Lifshin, Alvin Pang, Todd Swift, Amy Uyematsu, Eliot Weinberger, Alison Wong, Cyril Wong, Bryan Thao Worra, Xu Xi and Ouyang Yu. Cha was named Best New Online Magazine of 2008 and Best Online Magazine of 2011 by storySouth's Million Writers Award and was selected as The Gatekeeper's Site of the Week (Wednesday 1 July 2009), on Meet at the Gate, the website of Scottish publisher Canongate Books. Work published in Cha has been selected for publication in Best of the Web and Best of the Net anthologies (2009). A special feature of the journal is its critique column, "A Cup of Fine Tea", in which previously published works are discussed. Cha is currently catalogued in the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) Library and other places.
