Jintian (Chinese: 今天; literally: "Today") is the title of a Chinese literary journal. Founded in 1978,  it was the first non-official literary journal in the People's Republic of China since the 1950s. It ran for nine issues until it was censored in 1980.  It was revived in 1990.  Jintian was created in 1978 by Mang Ke, Bei Dao and others, and was first distributed on and around Democracy Wall in Beijing. It was instrumental in bringing the Misty Poets into the open, publishing work by Bei Dao, Duo Duo, Shu Ting, Yang Lian and others.  It ran for nine issues and published four books (poetry by Mang Ke, Bei Dao, and Jiang He, and a novella by Ai Shan [pen-name of Bei Dao]). It also ran two poetry readings (on 8 April and 21 October 1979), and two exhibitions of The Stars, the first non-official painters.   In 1990 Jintian was revived overseas, with Bei Dao as editor, and initially published from Stockholm. It is now an online journal, featuring writing in Chinese.  Some of the poems, short stories and essays first published in Jintian have been translated into English, notably in the series Chinese Writing Today, the first two volumes published by the Wellsweep Press, in the UK, and the third volume published by the Zephyr Press in the USA. The Jintian Series of Contemporary Literature is published by Zephyr Press, in the USA.  Chinese Writing Today The Jintian Series of Contemporary Literature (published by Zephyr Press)
