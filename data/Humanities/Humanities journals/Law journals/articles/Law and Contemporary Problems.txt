 Law and Contemporary Problems is a quarterly, interdisciplinary, faculty-edited publication of Duke University School of Law. Unlike traditional law reviews, L&CP uses a symposium format, generally publishing one symposium per issue on a topic of contemporary concern.  L&CP hosts an annual conference at Duke Law School featuring the authors of one of the yearâ€™s four symposia.  Established in 1933, L&CP is the oldest journal published at Duke University School of Law.
