This list includes notable journals and magazines concerned with intellectual property (IP) law and business, and their various sub-fields, such as copyright, patent and trademark laws. The list also includes official journals and gazettes of patent offices. Most  national and supranational patent and trade mark offices publish official gazettes, in which applications, registrations, and other official actions relating to specific intellectual property rights are officially published. In many countries, publication in the gazette is required for an action to take effect. Some patent and trade mark offices additionally publish journals or periodicals, which contain more general notices, new guidance and procedural rules, and other information. The list below is of a very small selection of official gazettes and journals, and indicates the publishing office after each gazette or journal listed.
