The Journal of Moral Theology is a journal that publishes peer-reviewed scholarly articles in the field of Roman Catholic moral theology. The journal is published semi-annually, with regular issues in January and June, that cover theological treatments of related topics in philosophy, economics, political philosophy, and psychology. Articles published in the journal undergo at least two double blind peer reviews before being selected for publication.  The journal was established by David Matzko McCarthy of Mount St. Mary's University, then the Fr. James M. Forker Professor of Catholic Social Teaching. He received considerable assistance from Joshua Hochschild, who was the Mount’s Dean of the College of Liberal Arts at that time, and from David Cloutier and William Mattison III, who edited the inaugural issue (January 2012). McCarthy’s work on the journal started in early in 2009, and by the end of the year, an intrepid editorial board was formed. The initial board membership was constituted by Melanie Barrett, University of St. Mary of the Lake/Mundelein Seminary; Joseph Capizzi, The Catholic University of America; David Cloutier, The Catholic University of America; Kelly Johnson, University of Dayton; M. Therese Lysaught, Loyola University Chicago; Bryan Massingale, Fordham University; William C. Mattison III, University of Notre Dame; Jeanne Heffernan Schindler, John Paul II Institute; Christopher P. Vogt, St. John’s University. The affiliations noted are current (not 2012). David McCarthy is the Associate Provost at Mount St. Mary’s University.  In 2016, Jason King took on the role of associate editor, and in 2017, he became the editor. Dr. King is the chair of the Department of Theology, St. Vincent College, Latrobe, PA. The managing editor is Kathy Criasia, Dean's Assistant, the College of Liberal Arts, Mount St. Mary's University. William College is the associate editor; he is Emeritus Professor of Theology and Philosophy, Mount St. Mary's University.
