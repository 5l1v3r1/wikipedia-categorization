Buddhist Studies Review is a peer-reviewed academic journal published by Equinox on behalf of the UK Association for Buddhist Studies. It was founded in 1983 by Russell Webb and Sara Boin-Webb. The UK Association for Buddhist Studies was established in 1996 and took over publication of Buddhist Studies Review two years later. The journal publishes articles on any aspect of Buddhism. It covers the different cultural areas where Buddhism exists or has existed (in Central, East, South, and Southeast Asia), historical and contemporary aspects (including developments in "Western" Buddhism), theoretical, practical and methodological issues, textual, linguistic, archaeological and art-historical studies, and different disciplinary approaches to the subject (e.g. archaeology, art history, anthropology, Asian studies, comparative religion, law, oriental studies, philosophy, philology, psychology, religious studies, and theology).
