The Journal of Law and Religion is a peer-reviewed, interdisciplinary journal published through Cambridge University Press and edited by the Center for the Study of Law and Religion at Emory University School of Law.  Its primary interests include topics related to the relationship between religion and law, including subjects related to theological jurisprudence and political theology.  The journal was founded at Hamline University School of Law by the Harvard Law professor Harold J. Berman in 1982 along with Stephen B.Young, then Dean of the law school.  The Council on Religion and Law and Harvard Divinity School Professor James Luther Adams were also instrumental in starting the Journal. The goal of the Journal was to provide multiple frameworks of analysis for the study and discussion of structures of positive law. The Journal moved to the Center for the Study of Law and Religion at Emory in 2013, two years prior to Hamline's merger with William Mitchell College of Law.  The Journal's co-editors include Silas Allard, Abdullahi Ahmed An-Na'im, Michael Broyde, M. Christian Green, Michael J. Perry, and John Witte, Jr.
