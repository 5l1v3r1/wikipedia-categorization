The ATLA Religion Database (ATLA RDB) is an index of academic journal articles in the area of religion.  It is updated monthly  and published by the American Theological Library Association (ATLA). The database indexes articles, essays, and book reviews related to a wide range of scholarly fields related to religion. The database is available on a subscription basis through a database aggregator. The total database includes over 2.1 million article citations from over 1,940+ journals.  There are more than a quarter of a million essay citations from more than 18,000 multi-author works. The number of book reviews is over half a million.  ATLA indexes multi-author works, such as Festschriften and conference proceedings, with separate records for each essay. The ATLA Religion Database, formerly available on CD-ROM, is a MARC record format database  that incorporates several out-of-print indexes, including Religion Index One: Periodicals, Religion Index Two: Multi-Author Works, and Index to Book Reviews in Religion.  The database indexes scholarly works on major world religions.  There are, however, selection criteria for inclusion according to scholarly merit and scope. More than 60 languages are represented.
