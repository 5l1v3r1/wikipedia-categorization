The Journal of Religion and Film is a biannual peer-reviewed academic journal that "examines the description, critique, and embodiment of religion in film". The editor-in-chief is John C. Lyden (Grand View University). It was established in 1997 by William L. Blizek and Ronald Burke (University of Nebraska at Omaha), who became interested in the subject of religion and film after hearing Andrew Greeley speak about images of God in popular movies.
