Flow is an online journal of television and media studies, published by the Department of Radio-TV-Film at the University of Texas at Austin.  It was conceived by graduate students Christopher Lucas and Avi Santo and launched in October 2004. Flow is intended to foster conversations amongst media scholars and non-academic communities. Flow's mission is to provide a space where researchers, teachers, students, and the public can read about and discuss the changing landscape of contemporary media at the speed that media move. Flow is organized around short, topical columns written by respected media scholars on a bi-weekly schedule. These columns invite response from the critical community by asking provocative questions that are significant to the study and experience of media. The journal is edited and organized by RTF graduate students at the University of Texas at Austin. Issues are managed by coordinating editors, and columns are assembled, solicited, and edited by a team of graduate student editors. The Former Coordinating Editors include: Chris Lucas (Vols. 1-2) Avi Santo (Vols. 1-2) Marnie Binfield (Vols. 3-5) Bryan Sebok (Vols. 3-4) Matthew Thomas Payne (Vols. 5-6) Alexis Carreiro (Vols. 6-7) Peter Alilunas (Vol. 7) Annie Petersen (Vols. 8 - ?)
