Jump Cut: A Review of Contemporary Media is an online journal covering the analysis of film, television, video, and related media.  Its stated goal is to approach its subject from a "nonsectarian left, feminist, and anti-imperialist" perspective. It takes its name from the jump cut, a film editing technique in which an abrupt visual change occurs. Jump Cut was established in 1974 by John Hess, Chuck Kleinhans (Northwestern University), and Julia Lesage (University of Oregon). It was published in print in tabloid form until 2001. Soon after, it began publishing online.
