Raven: A Journal of Vexillology is a peer-reviewed academic journal covering the scholarly examination of flags (vexillology), including the social, historical, and political significance of flags of all kinds. The journal is named for the Raven banner of the Vikings, reported by the editor to be the first to fly over North America.  It is abstracted and indexed in America: History and Life and Historical Abstracts.  Raven is sponsored by the North American Vexillological Association and produced in cooperation with the Philosophy Documentation Center.  Raven occasionally publishes special issues dedicated to particular flags.
