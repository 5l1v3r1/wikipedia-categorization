Cambrian Medieval Celtic Studies (1981-1992: Cambridge Medieval Celtic Studies) is a bi-annual academic journal of Celtic studies, which appears in summer and winter. The journal was founded in 1981 by Patrick Sims-Williams, who has remained the journal's editor to this day. More recently, CMCS Publications has widened its publishing output to monographs, such as Helen McKee's The Cambridge Juvencus manuscript glossed in Latin, Old Welsh, and Old Irish: Text and Commentary (2000) and Marged Haycock's Legendary Poems from the Book of Taliesin (2007).
