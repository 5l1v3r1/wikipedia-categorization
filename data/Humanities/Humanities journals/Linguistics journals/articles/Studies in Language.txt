It is published by John Benjamins Publishing Company and was established in 1977. Its managing editors are Balthasar Bickel (University of Zurich), Bernard Comrie (Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology and University of California, Santa Barbara), and Ekkehard König (Freie Universität Berlin).
