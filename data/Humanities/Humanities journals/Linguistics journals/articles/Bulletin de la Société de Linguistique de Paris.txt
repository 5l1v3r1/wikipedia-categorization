The Bulletin de la Société de Linguistique de Paris (abbr. BSL or BSLP) is an academic journal published by the Société de Linguistique de Paris since 1869. Published annually, the journal contains two separate volumes: one of articles, and one dedicated to the review of books recently published in linguistics. The journal's coverage includes most traditional subdisciplines within linguistics: historical linguistics (with a strong tradition of Indo-European studies and comparative grammar, but also studies of other families); linguistic typology; theoretical and descriptive linguistics; history of linguistics; natural language processing; language acquisition, and so forth.
