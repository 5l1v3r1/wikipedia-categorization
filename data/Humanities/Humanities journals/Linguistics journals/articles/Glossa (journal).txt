Glossa: A Journal of General Linguistics is a peer-reviewed open access academic journal covering general linguistics. It was established in 2016 and is published by Ubiquity Press. The editor-in-chief is Johan Rooryck (Leiden University). The journal is funded by LingOA and the Open Library of Humanities. In October 2015, the editors and editorial board of Lingua resigned en masse to protest their inability to come to an agreement with Elsevier regarding fair pricing models for open access publishing.  The former editors and board of Lingua started a new journal, while Elsevier continues publishing Lingua with new editors and a new editorial board. The original editorial board of Lingua is supported in their protest by the Association of Research Libraries, the American Association of State Colleges and Universities, the American Council on Education, the Canadian Association of Research Libraries, the Confederation of Open Access Repositories, Educause, and the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition.            Glossa has been cited as a predecessor for Algebraic Combinatorics, a mathematics journal established under similar circumstances when the editorial board of Springer's Journal of Algebraic Combinatorics resigned en masse in 2017.   The editorial board criticized Springer for "double-dipping", that is, charging large subscription fees to libraries in addition to high fees for authors who wished to make their publications open access.
