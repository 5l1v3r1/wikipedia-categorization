It was established in 1978 and is published by Cambridge University Press for the Nordic Association of Linguists. It is also supported by the Nordic Publication Committee for Periodicals in the Humanities. The current editors in chief are Catherine O. Ringen (University of Iowa) and Sten Vikner (Aarhus University). Three issues are published each year, one of them devoted to a special topic.
