American Speech is a quarterly academic journal of the American Dialect Society, established in 1925 and published by  Duke University Press. It focuses primarily on the English language used in the Western Hemisphere, but also publishes contributions on other varieties of English, outside influences on the language, and linguistic theory.  The current editor-in-chief is Michael Adams (Indiana University). The  Chronicle of Higher Education's Lingua Franca  consideres it a  "consistently reliable peer-reviewed source of information" and states that  "though it is scholarly and research based, thereâ€™s a surprising amount of information that is intelligible to anyone, even without special training in linguistics."  The journal was established in 1925 by Kemp Malone, Louise Pound, and Arthur G. Kennedy "to present information about English in America in a form appealing to general readers", and was inspired by H. L. Mencken. It became the official journal of the American Dialect Society in 1970.   This journal is indexed by the following services:
