Die Sprache is a peer-reviewed academic journal that was established in 1949. It contains articles on historical and comparative linguistics, especially of Indo-European languages. The main focus is on comparative grammar and etymology, but there are contributions on linguistic interpretation of text sources, epigraphy, and aspects of cultural history as well. The journal is published by Harrassowitz Verlag and it usually appears biannually. The current editor-in-chief is Heiner Eichner (University of Vienna).
