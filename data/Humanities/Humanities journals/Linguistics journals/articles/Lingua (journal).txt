Lingua: An International Review of General Linguistics is a peer-reviewed academic journal of general linguistics that was established in 1949 and is published by Elsevier. Its editor-in-chief is Marta Dynel (University of Lodz). In October 2015 the editors and editorial board of Lingua resigned en masse to protest their inability to come to an agreement with Elsevier regarding fair pricing models for open access publishing.   They subsequently started a new journal, Glossa.
