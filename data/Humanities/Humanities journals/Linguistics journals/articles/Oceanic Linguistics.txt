Oceanic Linguistics is a peer-reviewed academic journal covering research on the indigenous languages of the Oceanic area and parts of Southeast Asia, including the indigenous Australian languages, the Papuan languages of New Guinea, and the languages of the Austronesian (or Malayo-Polynesian) family.  Monographs on the same languages are published as Oceanic Linguistics Special Publications.  The journal was established in 1962 by George W. Grace (Southern Illinois University, later University of Hawaii). It has been published by the University of Hawaii Press since 1966 (vol. 5). In 1992, the editorship passed to Byron W. Bender (University of Hawaii) and in 2007 it passed to John Lynch (University of the South Pacific). Beginning with the 2019 volume, the editorship will pass to Daniel Kaufman, Yuko Otsuka, and Antoinette Schapper. Owen Edwards will serve as Assistant Editor and Alexander D. Smith as Review Editor. Oceanic Linguistics appears biannually in June and December. Its first electronic edition appeared in 2000 on Project MUSE. Back volumes up to three years behind the current volumes of both the journal and the monograph series are available on JSTOR.
