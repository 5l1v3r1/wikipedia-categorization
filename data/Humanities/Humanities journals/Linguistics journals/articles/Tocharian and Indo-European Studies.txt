Tocharian and Indo-European Studies (TIES) is a scholarly journal on Tocharian in the Indo-European context, established in 1987 by the Icelandic linguist Jörundur Hilmarsson. The journal initially appeared in Reykjavík, Iceland, but after Hilmarsson's death in 1992, the Danish linguist Jens Elmegård Rasmussen became the new executive editor, and the journal is currently based at Museum Tusculanum Press in Copenhagen. Until 2008 it was based at C.A. Reitzel Publishers Ltd., also in Copenhagen. When Rasmussen died in 2013, Birgit Anette Olsen became the new executive editor.
