Voprosy Filosofii (Russian: Вопросы философии, Problems of Philosophy) is a Soviet and Russian scientific and theoretical philosophical peer-reviewed academic journal. It was established in July 1947 under the guidance of the Presidium of the Russian Academy of Sciences (ru). Bonifaty Kedrov was one of its initiators and held the position of editor in chief 1947-9.    "Whom Does Cybernetics Serve?" was an anonymous article from "Materialist" which appeared in No. 5, 1953, (pp. 210–219). They attacked cybernetics as a "misanthropic pseudotheory", "a sterile flower on the tree of knowledge generated as a result of the one-sided and unbounded exaggeration of one of the demons of knowledge."  Two years later the magazine published "The Main Features of Cybernetics" by Sergei Sobolev, Alexey Lyapunov and Anatoly Kitov which defended Cybernetics against the unwarranted criticism by philosophers of what they regarded as a bono-fide science.
