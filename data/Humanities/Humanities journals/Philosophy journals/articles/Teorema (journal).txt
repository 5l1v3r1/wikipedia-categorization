Teorema is a triannual peer-reviewed academic journal of philosophy, published in Spain. It was established in 1971 by Manuel Garrido (*1925-†(2015) and published without interruption until 1986. Teorema also organised a significant number of conferences and symposia, on a wide variety of topics. In December 1996, Teorema resumed publication. The current editor-in-chief is Luis M. Valdés-Villanueva (University of Oviedo). Teorema publishes original articles in Spanish or in English in the following areas: logic, philosophy of language, philosophical logic, philosophy of mind, philosophy and history of science, epistemology, and related areas. The journal also regularly publishes special issues on specific themes and includes a supplement, limbo, a bulletin covering studies on the Anglo-Spanish philosopher Jorge Santayana. The journal is abstracted and indexed in the Arts and Humanities Citation Index, Latindex, Répertoire bibliografique de la philosophie, and The Philosopher's Index.
