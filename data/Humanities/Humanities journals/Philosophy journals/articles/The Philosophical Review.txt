The Philosophical Review is a quarterly journal of philosophy edited by the faculty of the Sage School of Philosophy at Cornell University and published by Duke University Press (since September 2006). The journal publishes original work in all areas of analytic philosophy, but emphasizes material that is of general interest to academic philosophers. Each issue of the journal contains approximately two to four articles along with several book reviews.  It was ranked the best English-language general philosophy journal in a poll conducted on the popular philosophy blog Leiter Reports.  The journal has been in continuous publication since 1892. Volume I contained articles by William James and John Dewey.
