The Journal of Philosophical Research is a peer-reviewed academic journal sponsored by the University of Notre Dame and the Canadian Philosophical Association. It publishes articles in English or French, from any philosophical orientation. The current editor-in-chief is Heather Battaly (University of Connecticut). It is published by the Philosophy Documentation Center. The journal was established as the Philosophy Research Archives in 1975 by the Philosophy Documentation Center, American Philosophical Association, and the Canadian Philosophical Association. It was jointly planned by these organizations as a solution to the space limitations of traditional journals.  Microfiche was the original format of publication and no limit was placed on the length of submissions. The journal accepted submissions in English or French, and the editorial team was led by William Alston. Volumes 1-7 (1975–1981) were published exclusively in microfiche format; volumes 8-14 (1982–1989) were published in a combination of microfiche and print formats. Shorter articles were published in the print portion of these volumes and longer pieces were placed in the microfiche supplements. In 1990 the journal was reorganized as the Journal of Philosophical Research, and it continues to publish works of unusual length, such as bibliographies, translations, and commentaries. All material originally published on microfiche is available online. The Journal of Philosophical Research has occasionally published special supplements in cooperation with the International Federation of Philosophical Societies and the American Philosophical Association.  The journal is abstracted and indexed in:
