The Revue de métaphysique et de morale is a French philosophy journal co-founded in 1893 by Léon Brunschvicg, Xavier Léon and Élie Halévy. The journal initially appeared six times a year, but since 1920 has been published quarterly.  It was the leading French-language journal for philosophical debates at the 20th century, hosting articles by Victor Delbos, Bergson, etc., and still exists today.  Xavier Léon served as the first editor of the journal until his death in 1935, when he was succeeded by Dominique Parodi.  On Parodi's death in 1955, the journal was headed by Jean Wahl.  It published in 1906 Bertrand Russell's article on the Berry paradox, as well as articles by Louis Bachelier, the logicist Jean Nicod, the mathematician Henri Poincaré, Félix Ravaisson, Célestin Bouglé, Henri Delacroix (concerning William James), Louis Couturat, Sully Prudhomme, Henri Maldiney, Francine Bloch, Frédéric Rauh, Jean Cavaillès, Julien Benda, Georges Poyer, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Georg Simmel, etc. More recently: Barbara Cassin, etc.
