Archiv f√ºr Begriffsgeschichte ('Archive for Conceptual History') is a German peer-reviewed academic journal. It was founded by Erich Rothacker, and is published by Christian Bermes, Ulrich Dierse and Michael Erler. The editor is Annika Hand. The journal publishes works on concepts of the history of philosophy and sciences, both from the European and from non-European traditions, on mythological and religious concepts, and on concepts of common parlance which have a characteristic significance for a special era or culture. The journal also embraces articles on revealing metaphors, on problems at translating concepts, as well as on theory and criticism of the method of conceptual history.
