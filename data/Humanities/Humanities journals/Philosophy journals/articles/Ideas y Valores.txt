Ideas y Valores is an academic journal of philosophy edited and published by the National University of Colombia. It appears three times per year and publishes articles in all areas of philosophy. The Revista Ideas y Valores was founded in 1951 by Cayetano Betancurt, the dean of the School of Philosophy (how it was called at that time) at the National University of Colombia. The journal was initially named Ideas, a title that was meant to evoke Plato and that reflected the speculative orientation that Betancurt wanted to give to the journal. The name was changed for the second issue due to the existence of another journal at the university that had the same name. Publication was interrupted between 1954 and 1962, and between 1972 and 1974. The Revista Ideas y Valores is indexed in Publindex of COLCIENCIAS (Category A2), Philosopher's Index, Ulrich's, The International Philosophical Bibliography, Biblioteca Electrónica Scielo Colombia, DIALNET, Redalyc, Latindex, and the Rèpertoire Bibliographique de la Philosophie.
