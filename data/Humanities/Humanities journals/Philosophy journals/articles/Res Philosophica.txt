Res Philosophica  (formerly The Modern Schoolman) is a peer-reviewed academic journal covering all major areas of philosophy from antiquity to the present. Established in 1925, it is one of the oldest philosophy publications in North America. The journal publishes both articles and reviews, and occasionally publishes special issues on specific topics. Contributors include Robert Audi, Lynne Rudder Baker, Jean Bethke Elshtain, Étienne Gilson, Jürgen Habermas, Norman Kretzmann, Bernard Lonergan, Jacques Maritain, Wildrid Parsons, Kristin Shrader-Frechette, Paul Draper, and Nicholas Wolterstorff.   The Modern Schoolman is published by the philosophy department at Saint Louis University, in cooperation with the Philosophy Documentation Center. In 2013, beginning with volume 90, The Modern Schoolman was relaunched as Res Philosophica.
