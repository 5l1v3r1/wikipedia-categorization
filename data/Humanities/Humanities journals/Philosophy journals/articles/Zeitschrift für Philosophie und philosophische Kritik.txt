The Zeitschrift für Philosophie und philosophische Kritik was an academic journal. It was established in 1837 by editor-in-chief Immanuel Hermann Fichte as Zeitschrift für Philosophie und spekulative Theologie and renamed in 1847. Notable early contributors included Christian Hermann Weisse. Publication was suspended from 1848 to 1852, after which Hermann Ulrici and Johann Ulrich Wirth (de) joined Fichte as editors. The journal served as an outlet for Fichte's views, especially about the philosophy of religion. It was published by Pfeffer in Halle (Saale) and Haacke in Leipzig.  The last volume (165) was issued in 1918.
