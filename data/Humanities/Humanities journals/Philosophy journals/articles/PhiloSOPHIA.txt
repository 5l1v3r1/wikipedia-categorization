philoSOPHIA: A Journal of Continental Feminism is a biannual peer-reviewed academic journal covering feminist theory and continental philosophy.    Published by SUNY Press, the journal was established by philoSOPHIA: the Society for Continental Feminism, which was founded in 2008.   The editors-in-chief are Lynne Huffer (Emory University) and Shannon Winnubst (Ohio State University).  The journal aims to "broaden the discipline of philosophy and enrich the practices of feminist theory".  In particular, it seeks to explore the idea of the feminine throughout the history of European philosophy, and how it relates to language, subjectivity, the body, and nature.  The journal is the product of philoSOPHIA: the Society for Continental Feminism, which was founded in Tennessee in 2008—initially as the French Feminism Circle—by Kelly Oliver (Vanderbilt University) and Stacy Keltner (Kennesaw State University). The journal was established in 2011, after the society's third annual conference. The founding co-editors were Elaine Miller and Emily Zakin (Miami University).  According to its founding editors, the society and journal were named after Sophia, the feminine aspect of God who fell from grace because of her love of knowledge.  The name serves to illustrate that women who love philosophy are not necessarily in love with the patriarchy.  The journal is abstracted and indexed in:
