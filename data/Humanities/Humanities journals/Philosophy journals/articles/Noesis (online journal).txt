Noesis is a domain-specific search engine and open access journal for academic philosophy.  The current online version is a prototype release.  Noesis may be treated as a sort of clearinghouse for scholarly e-journals in philosophy.   Noesis is currently undergoing development at Indiana University, thanks to a Digital Humanities Initiative of the National Endowment for the Humanities. The editor in chief is Anthony Beavers (University of Evansville).
