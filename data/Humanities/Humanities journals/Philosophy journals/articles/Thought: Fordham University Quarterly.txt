Thought: Fordham University Quarterly was a peer-reviewed academic journal that published articles and reviews on a broad range of topics in the Catholic tradition. The journal was established in 1926 at the America Press and moved to Fordham University in 1939,  with the first Fordham edition of the journal appearing in March 1940.  It continued to be published at Fordham until 1992. During this time the journal published a total of 267 issues containing over 5,000 English-language contributions from well-known philosophers, theologians, social activists, and intellectuals in several countries. The entire collection is available online from the Philosophy Documentation Center.
