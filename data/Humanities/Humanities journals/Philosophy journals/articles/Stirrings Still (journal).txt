Stirrings Still: The International Journal of Existential Literature (ISSNÂ 1551-0433) is an  academic journal founded in 2004 by members of Binghamton University's English Department. The journal was published biannually, in the winter and the summer, from 2004 to 2006 inclusive, and annually from 2007. Founded as a response to the growing perception of existentialism as anachronistic to literary study, Stirrings Still serves as a forum for the discussion of the relationship between existential literature & philosophy and postmodern literature & theory. The journal's name is a reference to the last piece of prose published by Samuel Beckett. The founding editor of Stirrings Still is Erik Grayson.
