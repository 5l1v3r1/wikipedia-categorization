Think: Philosophy for Everyone is an academic journal created to forge a direct link between contemporary philosophy and the general public. The central aim of the journal is to provide easily accessible and engaging writing by philosophers pre-eminent in their fields to a wide audience, unimpeded by academic jargon and technicality. The journal is sponsored by the Royal Institute of Philosophy in London and published by Cambridge University Press. Think's editor is Stephen Law. Think expressly aims to counter the popular impression that philosophy is pointless and wholly detached from everyday life. It also aims to expose some of the bad philosophy that currently passes as accepted wisdom, and offers contemporary philosophers the chance to help nurture and encourage philosophers of the next generation.
