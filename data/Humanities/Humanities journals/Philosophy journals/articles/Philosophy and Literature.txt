Philosophy and Literature is an academic journal founded in 1977 by Denis Dutton.  It explores the connections between literary and philosophical studies by presenting ideas on the aesthetics of literature, critical theory, and the philosophical interpretation of literature. The journal, which has been characterized as "culturally conservative",  aims to challenge "the cant and pretensions of academic priesthoods by publishing an assortment of lively, wide-ranging essays, notes, and reviews that are written in clear, jargon-free prose".   The journal is normally published twice a year, in April and October, by the Johns Hopkins University Press. Circulation is 823 and the average length of an issue is 224 pages. The current editor is Garry Hagberg of Bard College.
