The Numismatist (formerly Numismatist) is a monthly publication by the American Numismatic Association. Its current editor is Barbara Gregory. The Numismatist contains articles written on such topics as coins, tokens, medals, paper money, and stock certificates. All members of the American Numismatic Association receive the publication as part of their membership benefits. The Numismatist was originally published as a four-page leaflet in 1888 by George F. Heath in Chicago. The name was purchased by the American Numismatic Association many years later when the organization began to print a monthly publication for the benefit of its members.
