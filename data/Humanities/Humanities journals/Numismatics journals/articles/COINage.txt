COINage, a monthly American special-interest magazine, targets  numismatists and coin investors. Behn-Miller Publications, Inc. - under the joint ownership of Gordon Behn and COINage editorial director James L. Miller - originally published the magazine on a quarterly basis. In 1965 the magazine moved to a bimonthly publishing schedule, and has been published monthly since 1966. Behn retired in 1982, making Miller the sole publisher of COINage, as well as sole owner of the renamed Miller Magazines, Inc. Trimbach Media, Inc. purchased COINage, in 2012. COINage focuses primarily on American coins, although articles on paper money and non-American coins have appeared. Some of the topics covered by the magazine include: A monthly feature entitled "Coin Capsule" features information on coins from a specific year, interspersed with world history from that year. Not wanting to stick with any particular topics, the magazine does not have any specific editorial calendar.
