Perspectivia.net is an international and interdisciplinary online academic publication platform. The platform publishes articles and reviews in the humanities. Perspectivia.net operates as part of the German Max Weber Stiftung – Deutsche Geisteswissenschaftliche Institute im Ausland (Max Weber Foundation – German Humanities Institutes Abroad), which is in turn financially supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research. Articles and reviews are primarily submitted throughout the world by the German Historical Institutes and their invited scholars. The organization publishes electronic and retro-digitized texts which are then made available to the general public on its website. All material is published according to the open access principle, mostly under a creative commons license (CC-BY-NC-ND). Academic and scholarly articles are published in various languages, including German, English, French, Italian, Polish and Russian. The website may also be viewed in as many as eight different languages. Perspectivia.net started as an independent, government-subsidized project in 2007. It officially launched its online publication website in 2008.
