It has some relation to the <a href=\"/wiki/Problem_play\" title=\"Problem play\">problem play</a>. The viewer of the picture is invited to speculate about several different possible explanations of the scene.  The genre has much in common with that of <a href=\"/wiki/Book_illustration\" title=\"Book illustration\">book illustration</a>, then at its most popular, but with the text belonging to the illustration omitted.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>  \n</p><p>The genre began to emerge in the second half of the nineteenth century, along with the development of book illustrations that depicted \"pregnant\" moments in a narrative. One of the earliest problem pictures is <a href=\"/wiki/John_Everett_Millais\" title=\"John Everett Millais\">John Everett Millais</a>' <i>Trust Me</i>, which depicts an older man demanding that a young woman hand him a letter she has received. Either character might be uttering the words. The significance and content of the letter is left to the imagination.  Their relationship is also unclear; in view of their ages, they might be a married couple, or a father and daughter. \n</p><p>Other artists who worked in the genre included <a href=\"/wiki/William_Frederick_Yeames\" title=\"William Frederick Yeames\">William Frederick Yeames</a>, whose <i>\"<a href=\"/wiki/And_When_Did_You_Last_See_Your_Father%3F_(picture)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"And When Did You Last See Your Father? (picture)\">And when did you last see your father?</a>\"</i> became the most famous example of the genre. It depicts a young boy of the <a href=\"/wiki/English_civil_war\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"English civil war\">English civil war</a> period being gently interrogated by <a href=\"/wiki/Oliver_Cromwell\" title=\"Oliver Cromwell\">Cromwellian</a> troops who are looking for his Royalist father. It is implied that they are asking a trick question designed to discover his location. The painting is poised at the moment the child is about to answer. Yeames painted many other works of this type, including <i>Amy Robsart</i> and <i>Defendant and Counsel</i>. When the latter was exhibited a newspaper ran a competition for readers to guess what crime the woman was accused of.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tleft\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:252px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Sickert.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Sickert.jpg/250px-Sickert.jpg\" width=\"250\" height=\"178\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Sickert.jpg/375px-Sickert.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Sickert.jpg/500px-Sickert.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"1500\" data-file-height=\"1070\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Sickert.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Walter Sickert, <i>The Camden Town Murder</i>, originally titled, <i>What Shall We Do for the Rent?</i> or <i>What Shall We Do to Pay the Rent</i> 1908</div></div></div>\n<p>Some <a href=\"/wiki/Avant_garde\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Avant garde\">avant garde</a> artists also experimented with the genre, notably <a href=\"/wiki/Edgar_Degas\" title=\"Edgar Degas\">Edgar Degas</a> and his follower <a href=\"/wiki/Walter_Sickert\" title=\"Walter Sickert\">Walter Sickert</a>. Degas's <a href=\"/wiki/Interior_(Degas)\" title=\"Interior (Degas)\"><i>Interior</i></a> (1869) depicts an ambiguous scene suggestive of sexual transgression and violence (hence the alternative title of \"the Rape\").
