title=\"Yared\">Yared</a></div></div></div>\n<p>It is believed that  <a href=\"/wiki/Yared\" title=\"Yared\">Saint Yared</a> is the originator of Q\u0259ne.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> Since most of Saint Yared\u2019s works are based on the Bible, thus it can be assumed that the Bible is the original source of Q\u0259ne composition. Some parts of the Bible such as the Psalms and the <a href=\"/wiki/Song_of_Songs\" title=\"Song of Songs\">Song of Songs</a> (<a href=\"/wiki/Song_of_Songs\" title=\"Song of Songs\">Song of Solomon</a>)  are written in poetry form. Some books of the Bible such as the Song of Songs and the teachings (sermons) of Jesus use a lot of metaphorical and allegorical language similar to the S\u00e4m \u0259na W\u00e4rq mode of Q\u0259ne.  Saint Yared\u2019s non-sparing use of the content and style of the Bible helped in making his compositions acceptable and popular. Some of his compositions are still used as prayers in their original form.\n</p><p>Although Saint Yared was the earliest composer of Q\u0259ne, he does not appear to have set the forms and meters for the genre. There are, in fact, several possible candidates deemed responsible. One possibility lies with Q\u0259ne scholars during the reign of  <a href=\"/wiki/Eskender\" title=\"Eskender\">Emperor Eskender</a> (1478-1494) - Hawira, Menkera, Eskendera, Poeskenedera and Abidira. Another explanation \u2013 commonly referred to as the Wadla claim \u2013 attributes it to an early 15th-century scholar from Wadla named Yohann\u0259s Geblawi. And then there is the Gonj claim - attributing the deed to a certain T\u00e4wan\u00e4y who flourished after the 15th century. T\u00e4wan\u00e4y is alleged to have learned his Q\u0259ne alongside W\u00e4ld\u00e4 Mariam from a certain Eliab, who in turn learned it from alongside Lehib from S\u00e4mr\u00e4 Ab, who in turn learned it from Yohann\u0259s Geblawi.\n</p><p>Oral traditions also mention a certain D\u00e4q\u00e4 Est\u2019ifa as the scholar responsible for setting the meters for Q\u0259ne. D\u00e4q\u00e4 Est\u2019ifa is alleged to have acquired seven crafts from Greece - six having to do with magic, and the seventh Q\u0259ne - and returned to Ethiopia during the reign of <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=B%C3%A4%27ed%C3%A4_Mariam&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"B\u00e4&#39;ed\u00e4 Mariam (page does not exist)\">Emperor B\u00e4'ed\u00e4 Mariam</a> (1468-1478). He is then said to have taught the seventh craft to Prince Eskinder, Hawira, Menkera, Behur, and another Eskinder.\n</p><p>D\u00e4q\u00e4 Est\u2019ifa was quite popular at his former pupil Emperor Eskinder's court. One tradition claims he seduced the Emperor's wife and used one of his other crafts to vanish with her. Shortly thereafter, the Emperor set fire to the house D\u00e4q\u00e4 Est\u2019ifa and the Empress were hiding in. However, D\u00e4q\u00e4 Est\u2019ifa allegedly used another of his crafts to again disappear with his lover - and is said to still roam the island.\n</p><p>Yohann\u0259s Geblawi, in contrast to D\u00e4q\u00e4 Est\u2019ifa's worldly crafts, is said to have acquired his Q\u0259ne during a spiritual meditation. Yohann\u0259s was born at Geblon in Wadla (Lasta), and flourished at the time of <a href=\"/wiki/Zara_Yaqob\" title=\"Zara Yaqob\">Emperor Zar'a Yacob</a> (1434-1468). He and is said to have taught near Mount Tabor at Amara Saynt. Yohannes taught Q\u0259ne to the monk Aba W\u00e4ld\u00e4 Gabriel, who in turn taught S\u00e4mr\u00e4  Kristos (S\u00e4mr\u00e4  Ab). S\u00e4mr\u00e4  Kristos (S\u00e4mr\u00e4  Ab) is said to have given <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=B%C3%A4%27ed%C3%A4_Mariam&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"B\u00e4&#39;ed\u00e4 Mariam (page does not exist)\">Emperor B\u00e4'ed\u00e4 Mariam</a> (1468-1478) Q\u0259ne lessons. He also taught Lehib and Eliab, the latter of whom taught Q\u0259ne to T\u00e4wan\u00e4y and D\u0259d\u0259q W\u00e4ld\u00e4 Mariam.\n</p><p>Emperor Be'ede Mariam was so taken by the art of Q\u0259ne that he is said, on the advice of his teacher S\u00e4mr\u00e4  Kristos, to have gone into a week-long meditation to determine its origin. The answer was revealed to him on the festival of the changing of water unto wine (Qana ZeGelila), when he composed the following Q\u0259ne by divine inspiration,\n</p>\n<pre>       \u12f5\u1205\u1228 \u1270\u1230\u1265\u1228 \u12a0\u133d\u1295\u12a6 \u1208\u1230\u1265\u12a5\u1293\u1295 \u1295\u1201\u12ad\u1275\n       \u1208\u1265\u1203\u12ca \u12ad\u122d\u1235\u1276\u1235 \u1260\u121b\u12e8 \u1203\u12f2\u1235 \u1325\u121d\u1240\u1275\u1361\u1361\n</pre>\n<pre>       After man's strength was shattered with grief,\n       Christ the potter remade him with baptism.\n</pre>\n<p>As Be'ede Mariam's Q\u0259ne was composed during a gathering (Gubae) at the festival of <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Qana_ZeGelila&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Qana ZeGelila (page does not exist)\">Qana ZeGelila</a>, its form and meter has been known as Guba\u02bee Qana. S\u00e4mr\u00e4  Kristos was then said to have composed a Z\u00e4\u02be\u00e4mlak\u0259ye Q\u0259ne, after which the Emperor composed a Mib\u00e4zhu Q\u0259ne - the tradition claims.\n</p><p>One tradition also claims T\u00e4wan\u00e4y as D\u00e4q\u00e4 Est\u2019ifa's student. However, D\u00e4q\u00e4 Est\u2019ifa flourished during the reign of <a href=\"/wiki/Eskender\" title=\"Eskender\">Emperor Eskender</a> - a period when third generation disciples of Yohannes Geblawi also taught. This casts into doubt the alleged role of D\u00e4q\u00e4 Est\u2019ifa as the originator of Q\u0259ne - as the line of Yohannes Geblawi would have precedence. Furthermore, the more than fifty years that span between D\u00e4q\u00e4 Est\u2019ifa and T\u00e4wan\u00e4y would make it hard to take the latter as a disciple. Moreover, other accounts put T\u00e4wan\u00e4y's time at the early 18th century.\n</p><p>Accordingly, along the Q\u0259ne line of Yohannes Geblawi, S\u00e4mr\u00e4 Ab taught Lehib and Eliab. Eliab, in turn, taught D\u0259d\u0259q W\u00e4ld\u00e4 Mariam and T\u00e4wan\u00e4y. Tradition also holds that due to unfavorable conditions caused by the wars of Ahmad Gragn (mid-16th century), D\u0259d\u0259q W\u00e4ld\u00e4 Mariam and T\u00e4wan\u00e4y formed two separate Q\u0259ne styles - the Wadla and the Gonj schools, respectively.\n</p><p>Another interesting tradition holds that both disciples made the trip to D\u00e4q Island to further their knowledge. While D\u0259d\u0259q W\u00e4ld\u00e4 Mariam chanced upon mystical teachers that helped him further his Q\u0259ne, T\u00e4wan\u00e4y had no such luck. Instead, he fell into the carnal snares of mystical women who thwarted his many attempts to escape. When he turned into an eagle and tried to fly away, they would turn into pebbles and stone him. When he turned into a worm to wiggle his way off the island, they would turn into chickens and peck at him. He finally managed to escape by turning into a flea and attaching himself to a sack of Gesho leaves destined for sale on the mainland! Perhaps the notion of T\u00e4wan\u00e4y as the disciple of D\u00e4q\u00e4 Est\u2019ifa stems from his legendary exploits at D\u00e4q  Island.\n</p><p>The same tradition claims that by the time T\u00e4wan\u00e4y escaped from D\u00e4q, he had only retained a fraction of what Eliab had taught him. Hence, the Gonj school of Q\u0259ne associated with T\u00e4wan\u00e4y stresses Q\u0259ne composition, but only fleetingly covers Ge'ez verb conjugation and syntax - whereas the Wadla school associated with D\u0259d\u0259q W\u00e4ld\u00e4 Mariam teaches all these elements. The Wadla school was led by a succession of seven teachers - all with the title D\u0259d\u0259q - the last of whom was also named D\u0259d\u0259q W\u00e4ld\u00e4 Mariam. He was succeeded by Ma'ibel W\u00e4ld\u00e4 Hiwot (MeCha), who was then succeeded by Aleka Getahun (Gete Amoraw). The other disciple of S\u00e4mr\u00e4  Kristos, Lehib, taught Q\u0259ne to Zetre Wengel - who was succeeded by Zikri. He was in turn succeeded by Bekuru, and followed by Yonathan, who taught ZeNebiyat and QaleAwadi. Qale Awadi was succeeded by Aleka Maru of Amhara Sayint, who then taught Aqabe Se'at Kabte of Gonder.\n</p><p>Nevertheless, the multiplicity of Q\u0259ne lines of transmission does not imply multiple origins for Q\u0259ne. Saint Yared remains to be held as the founder of Q\u0259ne. Moreover, the many schools of Q\u0259ne can be seen in parallel to the various types of musical notations (such as Bethleheme, Qome, WenChere, AChabre, Wadle and Tegulete schools) that developed out of Saint Yared's Deggwa.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Q.C9.99ne_and_Poetry\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Q\u0259ne_and_Poetry\">Q\u0259ne and Poetry</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Qene&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Q\u0259ne and Poetry\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Traditionally any metrical verse with a rhyming scheme is defined as a poem, and since Q\u0259ne fulfills these requirements it can be considered to be a poem. However, while most poems have literal meaning, Q\u0259ne has to have a literal as well as a symbolic meaning by using the mode of S\u00e4m \u0259na W\u00e4rq. One can say that all Q\u0259ne are poems, but not all poems can be Q\u0259ne. Q\u0259ne is different in that a profound idea can be veiled underneath an every-day idea through the mode of S\u00e4m \u0259na W\u00e4rq (i.e. metaphorical representation). \nSince Q\u0259ne is sung as a hymn at a church service, one has to adhere to a standard metrical pattern.  The different types of Q\u0259ne have their own metrical pattern. The measure for the types of Q\u0259ne is not only numbers of verse but the syllabic metrical pattern as well. Thus, even though a poem uses a mode of S\u00e4m \u0259na W\u00e4rq, unless it follows a certain metrical pattern it can\u2019t be classified as a Q\u0259ne.\n</p>\n<pre>    \u12a5\u1293\u1295\u1270 \u12c8\u1323\u1276\u127d \u1240\u1295 \u12a0\u1208 \u1218\u1235\u120f\u127d\u1201\u1363\n    \u12a8\u1308\u1320\u1229 \u1291\u122e \u12a8\u1270\u121b \u1308\u1265\u1273\u127d\u1201\u1363\n    \u1218\u1220\u1228\u1275 \u12e8\u120c\u120b\u1275 \u130e\u1306 \u1218\u1225\u122d\u1273\u127d\u1201\u1363\n    \u12d8\u121b\u1208\u127d \u12a0\u12f0\u122b \u12a5\u1295\u12f3\u1275\u12c8\u12f5\u1245\u1263\u127d\u1201\u1361\u1361\n</pre>\n<pre>    Oh! Youth thinking it is your time\n    You left the countryside to settle in the city\n    But your house is without foundation\n    So be alert before the leaning house / harlot falls and/destroys you.\n</pre>\n<p>The poem has two W\u00e4rq phrases, the former is about the harlot and the latter warns about being destroyed by promiscuity. Even with such complex mode of S\u00e4m \u0259na W\u00e4rq, the author called it a poem and not a Q\u0259ne.

Since Q\u0259ne is sung as a hymn at a church service, classifying Q\u0259nes according to the metrical pattern is commonplace. Accordingly, there are 9 major Q\u0259ne types. And since some of them have sub-types, we can say that there are 17 types of Q\u0259ne.\n</p><p>The Q\u0259ne type is determined by the quantity and length of the verses. Thus there are some Q\u0259nes which have the same quantity of verses but are classified as different types of Q\u0259ne because of the variation in the length of the verses. A student starts his Q\u0259ne education starting from the shorter Q\u0259nes and working up to the lengthy Q\u0259nes. Each Q\u0259ne stage uses the previous stage as a building block. When a student is able to compose all the different types of Q\u0259ne, he is said to <i>Bet Molla</i>.

This shows that the one who is doing the N\u00e4t\u2019\u00e4qa already knows what the other composer was going to recite.\nExample: Emahoy G\u00e4lan\u00e4sh\u2019s N\u00e4t\u2019\u00e4qa of her father\u2019s Q\u0259ne\n</p><p>When the father was reciting\n</p>\n<pre>  \u201c\u1260\u1273\u1266\u122d\u1202 \u12a0\u1218 \u1240\u1290\u1338 \u121d\u120d\u12ae\u1275\u12a8 \u1348\u1228\u1235\u1363\u201d - When your divinity / horse galloped\n</pre>\n<p>And the daughter finished the Q\u0259ne by saying,\n</p>\n<pre>  \u201c\u12a2\u12ad\u1202\u1209 \u1235\u1265\u1216\u1276\u1219 \u1219\u1234 \u12c8\u12a4\u120d\u12eb\u1235\u1361\u1361\u201d - Moses and Elijah could not restrain it.\n</pre>\n<p>The amazed father then said,\n</p>\n<pre>  \u201c\u1260\u12a8\u1218 \u1230\u121b\u12a5\u12a9\u12aa \u12a0\u1290 \u12a2\u12ed\u1230\u121b\u12a5\u12aa \u1333\u12cd\u120e\u1235!\u201d - I hope St Paul does not hear what I have heard.\n</pre>\n<p>Meaning:  When a strong horse gallops it is hard for the rider to restrain it.\n</p><p>Hidden Meaning:  When Jesus took Peter and John with him to the top of Mount Tabor and showed them his transfiguration amongst Moses and Elijah, the disciples were overwhelmed and fell on the ground. The part about St Paul is referring to the Paul\u2019s edict barring women from teaching in public.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"G.C9.99lb.C3.A4t.E2.80.99a\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"G\u0259lb\u00e4t\u2019a\">G\u0259lb\u00e4t\u2019a</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Qene&amp;action=edit&amp;section=16\" title=\"Edit section: G\u0259lb\u00e4t\u2019a\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>G\u0259lb\u00e4t\u2019a involves taking someone\u2019s Q\u0259ne creating a new Q\u0259ne by changing the message and rhyming scheme. For example, it is common to wish newlyweds to have a marriage like Abraham and Sarah. But another person can use G\u0259lb\u00e4t\u2019a and overturn the blessing by saying let your marriage be not like Abraham and Sarah.  When asked why, one can say may the bride not be mentally anguished as Sarah was when Abraham had a child from Sarah\u2019s Servant Hagar. On the other hand, a fearful Abraham gave away his wife to King Abemelek saying she was his sister \u2013 and this is a good reason to overturn the first blessing.\n</p><p>Thus, likewise, one can overturn the message of a Q\u0259ne being recited and create a whole new Q\u0259ne.  Such practice will help open up new viewpoints of things we are accustomed to and help us list the advantages and disadvantages of a particular knowledge system.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"T.C3.A4m.C3.A4st.E2.80.99o\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"T\u00e4m\u00e4st\u2019o\">T\u00e4m\u00e4st\u2019o</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Qene&amp;action=edit&amp;section=17\" title=\"Edit section: T\u00e4m\u00e4st\u2019o\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>When composing Q\u0259ne, one is usually immersed in deep contemplation (T\u00e4m\u00e4st\u2019o) and becomes oblivious to one\u2019s surrounding. A well known example of such a deep contemplation is the story of the Bal\u00e4Q\u0259ne K\u0259fl\u00e4 Yohann\u0259s who was active during the reign of Emperor Iyassu I (1674 \u2013 1698).  It is said that K\u0259fl\u00e4 Yohann\u0259s lived a very humble life and was not popular among the luxury-seeking clergy of the court who were constantly at work to put a rift between him and the emperor.   On one occasion, K\u0259fl\u00e4 Yohann\u0259s,  deep in contemplation, did not salute   as the Emperor entered the D\u00e4br\u00e4 B\u0259rhan S\u0259llase Church with his entourage.  The clergy were quick to point out  K\u0259fl\u00e4 Yohann\u0259s\u2019 faux pas to the Emperor. Knowing that K\u0259fl\u00e4 Yohann\u0259s meant no malice, the Emperor threw at him a gold nugget to rouse him from his meditation. K\u0259fl\u00e4 Yohann\u0259s then approached the Emperor and composed the following  Q\u0259ne:\n</p>\n<pre>   \u1260\u12a5\u1235\u1322\u134b\u1296\u1235 \u12a0\u12a5\u1263\u1295 \u12a5\u1218 \u12e8\u1280\u120d\u1241\u1363\n   \u12d8\u1260\u1320\u1292 \u12a2\u12eb\u1231 \u1260\u12c8\u122d\u1241\u1361\u1361\n</pre>\n<pre>   Since all the stones were used on (the martyr) Stephen\n   Iyassu stoned me with gold.\n</pre>\n<p>The clergy were further disgraced when the Emperor rewarded K\u0259fl\u00e4 Yohann\u0259s the gold nugget.  K\u0259fl\u00e4 Yohann\u0259s donated the gold nugget to the church.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Qene&amp;action=edit&amp;section=18\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-kweschn-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\">^ <a href=\"#cite_ref-kweschn_1-0\"><sup><i><b>a</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-kweschn_1-1\"><sup><i><b>b</b></i></sup></a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Yigzaw, Mariye. <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://kweschn.com/2011/09/01/qene-or-sem-enna-werq-wax-and-gold/\">\"Qene or Sem enn\u00e1 Werq\"</a>, <i><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Kweschn&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Kweschn (page does not exist)\">kweschn</a></i>, 2011.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-2\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Yigzaw, Mariye. <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.qeneonnet.org/aboutqene.php?contentid=6\">\"Origin &amp; Source of Q\u0259ne Subject Matter\"</a>, <i><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=QeneOnNet&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"QeneOnNet (page does not exist)\">QeneOnNet</a></i>, Addis Ababa, 2016.</span>\n</li>\n</ol></div></div>\n<dl><dt>Bibliography</dt></dl>\n<ul><li><cite class=\"citation book\">Levine, Donald J (2007). <i>Wax and Gold: Tradition and Innovation in Ethiopian Culture</i>.
