If not a prerequisite for the superhero genre, the origin... is certainly a prominent and popular trope that recurs so frequently as to offer clues to the nature of this narrative tradition.

[T]he death of Peter Parker's uncle powerfully shapes his hero ethos and his desire to fight crime. ... [Footnote 1] There are three notable differences between the film and the comic versions of the Spider-Man origin. The first is that in the comic, Peter Parker was not provoked in any way to allow the thief to escape (as he was in the film by the rude behavior of the promoter). The second is that in <i>Amazing Fantasy #15</i>, Uncle Ben never utters the line \"With great power comes great responsibility.\" Rather, this line is stated in the final narration. The third is that in the film, Uncle Ben is killed while waiting for Peter in the car, but in the comic, he's killed in a home invasion. Notably, in more recent issues of the comic, Uncle Ben's murder and the origin of the \"great responsibility\" line have been retroactively changed (\"<a href=\"/wiki/Retroactive_continuity\" title=\"Retroactive continuity\">retconned</a>\") to fit with the movie version.</q></cite><span title=\"ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Abook&amp;rft.genre=bookitem&amp;rft.atitle=6.+With+Great+Power+Comes+Great+Culpability%3A+How+Blameworthy+is+Spider-Man+for+Uncle+Ben%27s+Death%3F&amp;rft.btitle=Spider-Man+and+Philosophy%3A+The+Web+of+Inquiry&amp;rft.place=Hoboken%2C+New+Jersey&amp;rft.series=%28Blackwell+philosophy+and+pop+culture+series%29&amp;rft.pages=86%2C+99&amp;rft.pub=John+Wiley+%26+Sons%2C+Inc.&amp;rft.date=2012&amp;rft.isbn=978-0-470-57560-4&amp;rft.aulast=Tallon&amp;rft.aufirst=Philip&amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fen.wikipedia.org%3AOrigin+story\" class=\"Z3988\"><span style=\"display:none;\">&#160;</span></span></span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-10\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-10\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><cite class=\"citation book\">Duncan, Randy; Smith, Matthew J.
