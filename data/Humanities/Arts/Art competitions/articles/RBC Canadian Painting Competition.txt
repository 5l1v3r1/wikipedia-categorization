The RBC Canadian Painting Competition is an open competition for emerging Canadian artists that was established in 1999. The RBC Canadian Painting Competition is supported by the Canadian Art Foundation, the publisher of Canadian Art (magazine).  Initially naming three regional winners, since 2004 there are one national winner and two honourable mentions.  The competition has 15 finalists, five from three regions in Canada, Eastern Canada (Quebec, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, PEI, Newfoundland and Labrador), Central Canada (Ontario), Western Canada (Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, British Columbia, Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut). Three regional juries convene to determine one national winner and two honourable mentions from the 15 finalists. The national winner receives a purchase prize of $25,000, the two honourable mentions each receive $15,000 and the remaining 12 finalists receive $2,500 each. The winning work and the honourable mentions become part of the RBC Corporate Art Collection which holds more than 4,500 works.   In 2016, 586 works were submitted.  In 2008 an exhibition at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa and the Musée d'art contemporain de Montréal provided an overview of the first ten years of the competition.
