Opus signinum ('cocciopesto' in modern Italian) is a building material used in ancient Rome. It is  made of tiles broken up into very small pieces, mixed with mortar, and then beaten down with a rammer.  Pliny in his Natural History describes its manufacture: "Even broken pottery has been utilized; it being found that, beaten to powder, and tempered with lime, it becomes more solid and durable than other substances of a similar nature; forming the cement known as the "Signine" composition, so extensively employed for even making the pavements of houses."  Pliny's use of the term "Signine" references "Signia (modern Segni), the name of a town in Latium which was famous for its tiles."  The technique began in North Africa, some time before 256 B.C., and spread north from there to Sicily and finally to the Italian peninsula.   Floors of signinum are found extensively in the Punic towns of North Africa and commonly in the Hellenistic houses on Sicily.  While some signinum pavements have been found in Rome, the technique is not common there.  Vitruvius describes the process of laying a floor, whether signinum or mosaic.  The trend began in the 1st century BC, proliferating in private homes as well as public buildings.  By the 2nd century, opus signinum would give way to more patterned styles of pavement.
