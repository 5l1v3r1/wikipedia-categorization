In aesthetics, the human figure or human form in art, sculpture and other art forms involves a study and appreciation of the beauty of the human body in its depiction or presentation. The study involves an appreciation of the body shape, including body postures - sitting, standing or even sleeping, and movements - walking, running, dancing etc. Kant  refers to the human figure as the ideal of beauty.  The human figure conforms very well to the law that states that form follows function, which is believed to be a result of evolution over thousands of generations. The human figure is one of the most enduring themes in the visual arts. Very few art forms are not related to human figure such as music, though it figures in lyrics. A study of the human figure includes a detailed study of the following subjects: Body proportions are the study of relation of human body,  or in general, animal body, parts to each other and the whole, essential for depiction of the overall figure. A figure drawing is a study of the human form in its various shapes and postures. It is a study or stylized depiction of the human form, with the line and form of the human figure as the primary objective, rather than the subject person. It is a composed image of the subject in a still position. A life drawing is a work that has been drawn from an observation of a live model.
