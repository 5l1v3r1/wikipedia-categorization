It is unique in its method of allowing a group of <a href=\"/wiki/Painting\" title=\"Painting\">artists</a> to work simultaneously on a canvas without discussion or planning beforehand. The result is a painting created by a group of individuals that looks like the work of a single artist.\n</p><p>Tunisian artist <b>Hechmi Ghachem</b> created Tunisian Collaborative Painting in 1988 when <a href=\"/wiki/Zine_el-Abidine_Ben_Ali\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali\">Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali</a> became president and dictator of Tunisia. \u201cFreely expressing yourself in Ben Ali\u2019s Tunisia was dangerous,\u201d said Hechmi. He set out to reclaim freedom of expression for Tunisian artists. He formed groups called Brigades d'Intervention Plastique. \u201cThe brigades enabled artists to leave their professional loneliness and work in the same space, and on the same canvas\u201d said Hechmi.  \u201cThey created ties built on pleasure, excitement, struggle, jealousy, life, and love and death, as in every creative act. Together they produced paintings which mixed the best parts of themselves with the best parts of each of the other artists. One painting represented the individuality of all.\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-DB_Correspond_1-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-DB_Correspond-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Hechmi Ghachem took his Brigades all over Tunisia. When a painting was finished it was given to the host who supplied the space where it was painted. Over a period of several years, hundreds of paintings were created. Many artists participated, some of them well-known and others who were new. The paintings they created together preserved the freedom of artists during the dictatorship of Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali.<sup id=\"cite_ref-DB_Correspond_1-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-DB_Correspond-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Tunisian_Collaborative_Painting_in_America\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Tunisian Collaborative Painting in America</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Tunisian_Collaborative_Painting_in_United_Kingdom\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Tunisian Collaborative Painting in United Kingdom</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Form\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Form</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Notes\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Notes</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Tunisian_Collaborative_Painting_in_America\">Tunisian Collaborative Painting in America</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Tunisian_collaborative_painting&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Tunisian Collaborative Painting in America\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In November 2008, U.S. Ambassador to Tunisia, Robert Godec invited artist  David Black to a reception for his paintings which were hanging in the Ambassador\u2019s residence under the <a href=\"/wiki/Art_in_Embassies_Program\" title=\"Art in Embassies Program\">Art in Embassies Program</a> of the U.S. Department of State.

Seeing what emerges without any pre-determination gives the artist incredible insight into what is possible in art. As a teaching tool, with its potential for visual expression, Tunisian Collaborative Painting has the potential to be a school unto itself.\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> \n</p><p>On November 8, 2010, at the invitation of Ira Goldberg, David Black conducted five days of workshops in Tunisian Collaborative Painting at The Art Students League of New York. One hundred and twenty-five artists from 30 countries created 26 paintings and each one of them looked like the work of a single artist. The word most used by the artists to describe their experience was \u201cliberating.\u201d  In keeping with Tunisian tradition, the completed art works were donated to be auctioned off for the benefit of the school.\n</p><p>On December 17, 2010, a month after the workshops at The Art Students League, a 26-year-old Tunisian, <a href=\"/wiki/Mohamed_Bouazizi\" title=\"Mohamed Bouazizi\">Mohamed Bouazizi</a> was selling fruit to feed his family. Ben Ali\u2019s police took his fruit away and beat him. Mr. Bouazizi poured paint thinner on himself and lit a match. Word of his fiery death spread quickly and some of the Tunisian artists David Black had painted with risked their lives demonstrating in the streets. The <a href=\"/wiki/Tunisian_Revolution\" title=\"Tunisian Revolution\">Jasmine Revolution</a> ended a month later on January 10, 2011 when Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, the ruler of Tunisia for 23 years, fled the country. \n</p><p>In November 2011, the new government of Tunisia gave permission for the Tunisian artists to travel to America as guests of David Black.  The participation of the Tunisian artists in the Tunisian Collaborative Painting workshops at The Art Students League in New York generated worldwide interest.
