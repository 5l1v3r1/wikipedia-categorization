The North Sea Magical Realists are a collective of artists resident on the North Sea coast whose art is loosely influenced by the aesthetics of Magical Realism. Its leading members include the artists Peter Rodulfo (b. 1958) and Mark Burrell (b. 1957).           Aware of each other's work for a number of years, Burrell and Rudolfo first met in New York USA, when exhibiting at the New York Expo of 1998. In 2016 Burrell and Rodulfo elected Sir Thomas Browne as honorary 'Grand-father' of the movement, and simultaneously painted items found in Browne's Musaeum Clausum (section Rarities in Pictures); Rodulfo painting item number 3 in the medium of oils on canvas (157 x 143 cm) with a title of Dr. Browne goes Submarining; Burrell painting item 12 in the medium of alkyd resins on board (50 x 49 cm) with a title of Silent Presence.   In November 2017 the North Sea Magical Realists held their first show at the Tripp Gallery, Amwell Street, London. Rodulfo and Burrell exhibited paintings, sculptures, etchings and included assemblages by group member Guy Richardson (b.1932)
