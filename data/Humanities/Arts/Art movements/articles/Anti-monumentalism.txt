Anti-monumentalism (or Counter-monumentalism) is a philosophy in art that denies the presence of any imposing, authoritative social force in public spaces. It developed as an opposition to monumentalism whereby authorities (usually the state or dictator) establish monuments in public spaces to symbolize themselves or their ideology, and influence the historical narrative of the place.   According to artist Rafael Lozano-Hemmer,  anti-monument "refers to an action, a performance, which clearly rejects the notion of a monument developed from an elitist point of view as an emblem of power."  Krzysztof Wodiczko's Bunker Hill Monument Projections   and Do-Ho Suh's Public Figures can be considered examples of anti-monumentalism.
