Zenitism (Serbo-Croatian: Zenitizam / Зенитизам) was an art movement in Yugoslavia from 1921 until 1926, first in Zagreb from 1921 to 1924 and from 1924 in Belgrade. The movement was mainly involved in visual arts, graphic design, poetry, literature, theatre, film, architecture and music.  Like other avant-garde movements at the time, it held anti-war, anti-bourgeois and anti-nationalist views and rejected traditional culture and art. Micić defined the movement as "abstract metacosmic expressionism." Most of its ideas were communicated through the Zenit magazine which Ljubomir Micić launched and which published 43 issues. The movement was established following World War I, during which Yugoslavia lost a million inhabitants.  Although some artists from the region were known in Europe, Zenitism was the first notable art movement from the Balkans in Europe.  All Zenit issues can be viewed freely in the National Library of Serbia's digital archives:
