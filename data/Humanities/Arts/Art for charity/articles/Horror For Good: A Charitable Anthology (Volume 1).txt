Horror for Good: A Charitable Anthology (Volume 1) is a non-themed anthology of thirty-two horror short stories, featuring some of the biggest names in the horror fiction genre, including Joe R. Lansdale, Ramsey Campbell, Jack Ketchum, F. Paul Wilson, Ray Garton and Joe McKinney. It was published by Cutting Block Press in 2012 and 100 percent of the proceeds will go to amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research. The anthology was co-edited by Mark Scioneaux, Robert S. Wilson and R. J. Cavender.  Scioneaux, Horror for Good founder, writes in his original introduction that "The heart of the horror community is on full display, and it stretches from the very top with Horror Writers Association President Rocky Wood, all the way to an author whose first ever published work will appear in these pages. The Horror Community has heart!"  Scioneaux adds, "The authors contained within these pages are a mix of some of the brightest stars and some of the most promising new talent in horror. They have donated their stories, consisting of rare reprints, personal favorites, and brand new, never-before-published tales."  The anthology premiered at the World Horror Convention in Salt Lake City, Utah in March 2012.
