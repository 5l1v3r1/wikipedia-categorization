The Electronic Art Caf√© (EAC) is a touring art project, which consists of events and exhibitions by artists of international avant-garde. The seat was in the Exhibition Palace in Rome. Located in New York City in 1994 from an idea of Umberto Scrocca, was hosted in the Great Hall of The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art at the symposium "New York City - Sarajevo", was attended by Vanessa Redgrave, Susan Sontag and Lisa Gaye. Currently the seat is in Rome in Piazza Farnese at the Wine Bar Camponeschi and is curated by Achille Bonito Oliva, which invites artists on stage to perform with their work, a performance or a video, thus creating the brand of artist EAC.
