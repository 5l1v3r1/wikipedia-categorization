 The Icebergs is an 1861 landscape oil painting by American painter Frederic Edwin Church that was inspired by sketches created on a one-month voyage in 1859 to the North Atlantic around Newfoundland and Labrador.  He was accompanied by his friend, Louis Legrand Noble, who documented the voyage in his book, After Icebergs with a Painter.   The painting measures  1.64 × 2.85 metres (5.4 × 9.4 ft) and is exhibited at the Dallas Museum of Art, which acquired it in 1979.
