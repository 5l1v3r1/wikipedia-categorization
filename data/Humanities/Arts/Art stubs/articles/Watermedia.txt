In art, watermedia is the general term for media that are distinguished from oil or other media by being diluted with water when used.  Watermedia include watercolours, gouache and acrylic, amongst others. It is sometimes combined with other media, commonly collage.  There are some unusual examples of watermedia being diluted with Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, tequila  and sweat instead of water, and painter Johnny O'Brady has "added tea to [his] brush water".  There are a number of Watermedia societies.
