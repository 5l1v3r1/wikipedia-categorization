Anthropotechnic is a term used in art, science and literature to denote something with aspects of both man and machine.  Paintings such as Max Ernst's "Oedipus Rex" are early examples of the use of this quality.  In technology, it is any field of science that attempts to make machines and automation more user-friendly. In sociology, it is used to describe the relationship between man and anything that is perceived as inflexible or inhumane such as slavery, religion or animals.
