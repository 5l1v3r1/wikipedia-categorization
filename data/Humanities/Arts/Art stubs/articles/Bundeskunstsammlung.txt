The Bundeskunstsammlung (Sammlung zeitgenössischer Kunst der Bundesrepublik Deutschland) - The Federal Collection of Contemporary Art, is a collection of modern works of art held by the government of the Federal Republic of Germany. Based on  the principle that creative arts play  an  important  role in democratic society, it was founded in 1970 by Willy Brandt acting  on  a proposal by the then chairman of the German Federation  of Artists.  Although it contains works of Isa Genzken, Thomas Struth, Olafur Eliasson, Jonathan Monk, Georg Baselitz, Markus Lüpertz, A. R. Penck, Markus Oehlen, Gerhard Richter, Wolfgang Tillmans and others, the collection  does not  have a central,  permanent  home; instead, the works are exhibited in  various museums and government  offices throughout  the country.
