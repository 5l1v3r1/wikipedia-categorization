Oil stick, oil bar, or oilstick, is an art medium.  It is produced in a stick form similar to that of a crayon or oil pastel.  It is distinguished from oil pastel, to which it may appear similar, in that the oil used is comparatively volatile, causing a skin to develop on exposed surfaces. Oil sticks are oil paint in solid form. Oil sticks are made by compressing wax and oil until it forms into an oil stick. The same basic pigments and drying oils that are used in the formulation of tube paint are combined with wax and rolled into a crayon.  Oil sticks can be used to produce drawings, paintings, and sketches. It is not a common medium nor a much used medium however is highly effective in art.
