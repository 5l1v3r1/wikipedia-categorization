Raven Row is a free art exhibition centre in Spitalfields.  It was constructed from numbers 56 and 58, Artillery Lane.  These properties were built about 1690.  The area was formerly used for testing artillery and this portion of the lane was known as Raven Row until 1895.  The buildings have previously been used as shops of Huguenot silk weavers and traders.  They were converted into a gallery in 2009 by Alex Sainsbury who established a charity to run it.  The inaugural exhibition was of work by New York artist Ray Johnson.   Raven Row has held exhibitions by K.P. Brehmer, Iain Baxter, Adam Chodzko, Suzanne Treister, Peter Kennard, Hilary Lloyd, Harun Farocki, Eduardo Paolozzi, Stephen Willats and Yvonne Rainer. Other exhibitions have been curated by Richard Grayson,   Lars Bang Larsen  and Alice Motard.  Coordinates: 51°31′07″N 0°04′40″W﻿ / ﻿51.5185°N 0.0777°W﻿ / 51.5185; -0.0777
