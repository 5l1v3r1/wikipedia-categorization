Black Spark is an anonymous male American film director and photographer  (born on 14 August 1990) who is most noted for his hypersexualized music videos and unique surreal style.  He began posting videos in the fourth quarter of 2010. He has stated in interviews that he is bisexual, that all videos are about his own sex life, and that he is influenced by art pornography from the 1970s.  Much speculation about his identity has been made. Some sources claimed to have identified him as an adult film actor or model who has done scenes for a web company called "CollegeDudes".   Black Spark has given reasons in interviews as to why he has chosen to be anonymous. His everyday real life is the opposite of Black Spark's hypersexualized life, he works on other projects, and he doesn't want the Black Spark identity to hinder his "large-scale future plans in film".
