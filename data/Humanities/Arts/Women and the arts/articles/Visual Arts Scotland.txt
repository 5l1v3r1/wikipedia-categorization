In the year of 1924, William McDougall founded the Scottish Society of Women Artists due to the fact that his daughter, Lily McDougall, was a talented painter and could not be recognised simply because she was a woman. In the early 20th century, women didn't have the ability to gain acknowledgment for their artistic skills because it was male dominant. William McDougall created this organisation to give women the opportunity to expand their artistic horizons and to encourage them to continue with their artistic ventures. This organisation lasted until the late 1980s when it was reformed due to the changing times. It was called the Scottish Artists and Artist Craftsmen.  Alison Dunlop RSW was President of the Society in 1997-99, when it was re-named Visual Arts Scotland.  This organisation has various and diverse artists from across the country as its members
