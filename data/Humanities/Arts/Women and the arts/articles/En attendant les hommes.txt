En attendant les hommes is a 2007 documentary film about women muralists in Oualata, Mauritania. In this town on the far edge of the Sahara desert, three women practice traditional painting, and decorate the walls of the town. In a society apparently dominated by tradition, religion and men, these women unreservedly express themselves and comment freely on the relationship between men and women.
