The Australian party was founded in October 2013 by two Sydney-based artists, PJ Collins and Nicholas Gledhill,  and registered by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) in August 2014.   Money was raised for the party's registration through a crowd-funding campaign.  Two Arts Party members stood as independent candidates at the 2015 Queensland state election, as the party had not been registered in time to contest the election.  Later in the year, the party's leader, PJ Collins, stood as an ungrouped Legislative Council candidate at the 2015 New South Wales state election.  The first official Arts Party candidate was Lou Pollard in the 2015 North Sydney by-election,  who came 8th in a field of 13 candidates. The Arts Party fielded seven candidates for the House of Representatives and thirteen senate candidates across all states in the 2016 federal election.  The entire campaign was once again financed through a crowd-funding campaign.  The House of Representatives candidates were Michael Anthony Ackroyd in the seat of Wentworth NSW,  Shea Caplice in the seat of Warringah NSW,  Tim Sanderson in the seat of Franklin TAS,  Christopher Gordon in the seat of Bennelong NSW,  Sally Baillieu in the seat of Dunkley VIC,  Stephen Beck in the seat of Longman QLD   and Andrew Charles Tyrrell in the seat of Petrie QLD.
