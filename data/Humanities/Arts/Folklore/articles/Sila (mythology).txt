Sila (alternatively spelled Si'la or called Si'lat) is a supernatural creature assigned to the jinn in Arabian folklore. They are described as talented shapeshifters often appearing in human form and female.  Accordingly they are said to seduce men, marry them or even give birth a child from a relationship between human and jinn.
