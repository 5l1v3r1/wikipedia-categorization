The story of the Two Wolves is a popular 21st-century legend of unknown origin, attributed to Native Americans, sometimes Lenape  or Cherokee  or parable  that is also known as "Which one do you feed",  "Grandfather Tells",  "The Wolves Within",  and "Tale Of Two Wolves".  It likely originated with Billy Graham, where it mentioned Eskimoes instead,  and is a story of a grandfather using a metaphor of two wolves fighting within him to explain his inner conflicts to his grandson. When his grandson asks which wolf wins, the grandfather answers whichever he chooses to feed. The story is frequently quoted in various forms in media articles,    a podcast called The One You Feed,  and was summarized in the 2015 film Tomorrowland.   From Wikiquote:   The names and phrases from the following are likely referring to this legend: There is a story told by the Reverend Billy Graham in his book The Holy Spirit: Activating God's Power in Your Life (W Publishing Group 1978) about an Eskimo with a black dog and a white dog  that may be a variant of, or similar in some respects to, the Two Wolves.
