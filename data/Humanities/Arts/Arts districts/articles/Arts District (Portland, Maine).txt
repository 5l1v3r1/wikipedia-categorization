The Arts District of Portland, Maine, USA, covers a large part of upper Congress Street towards the West End. There are many art galleries, a theater company,  museums, and schools in the general area. It is near the Maine College of Art. An event that occurs in the district is the First Friday Art Walk — a self-guided tour that takes place on the first Friday of each month from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. All of the galleries, museums, and local businesses open their doors to the public for a view of everything that is going on in the art community. Most galleries host the event with food and drink. The Portland Museum of Art opens its doors to the public free of charge. The Arts District is home to two television stations (WCSH and WMTW) and several radio stations. Coordinates: 43°39′20″N 70°15′40″W﻿ / ﻿43.65556°N 70.26111°W﻿ / 43.65556; -70.26111
