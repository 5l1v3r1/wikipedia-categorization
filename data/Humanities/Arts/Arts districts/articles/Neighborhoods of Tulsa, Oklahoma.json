The area provides easy access to I 244, I 44, Hwy 169 (Mingo Valley Exp), The Creek Turnpike, and the Broken Arrow expressway. Such easy access makes it quick for driving to desired locations and businesses in Downtown, Midtown, Southside, Westside, the Airport, all the major shopping/entertainment areas of the city, and to the outlying cities of Broken Arrow, Owasso, Bixby, and Jenks. The area offers housing built from the early 1970s to the present.\n</p><p>The historic and now largely abandoned community of <a href=\"/wiki/Alsuma,_Oklahoma\" title=\"Alsuma, Oklahoma\">Alsuma, Oklahoma</a> lies in this area.  Alsuma was annexed by Tulsa in 1966, and is now listed as a ghost town.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Arnett_21-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Arnett-21\">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Southern_Hills\">Southern Hills</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Neighborhoods_of_Tulsa,_Oklahoma&amp;action=edit&amp;section=34\" title=\"Edit section: Southern Hills\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Southern Hills is an exclusive neighborhood on the south side that is centered on the <a href=\"/wiki/Southern_Hills_Country_Club\" title=\"Southern Hills Country Club\">Southern Hills Country Club</a> at 61st and Lewis. Southern Hills Country Club has hosted 13 major golf championships including four <a href=\"/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)\" title=\"U.S. Open (golf)\">U.S. Opens</a>.

Constructed largely in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, attractions in this part of the city include McClure Park, which is notable for its <a href=\"/wiki/Disc_golf\" title=\"Disc golf\">disc golf</a> course, the Carl Smith Athletic Complex, and the popular Admiral Twin Drive-In movie theatre. There is also a large portion of <a href=\"/wiki/U.S._Route_66\" title=\"U.S. Route 66\">Route 66</a> on Tulsa's east side. Areas that fall in Union and Broken Arrow School districts are increasingly attracting high-income professionals looking for suburban life within the city limits. Mayo Demonstration Academy, a magnet school of the Tulsa Public School system, is located in this area. Eastgate Metroplex and East Central High School are also in this area. Also the area is home to Tulsa's Eastern hospitality district, where many hotels are located.\n</p><p>East Tulsa is also home to growing <a href=\"/wiki/Mexican-American\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Mexican-American\">Mexican-American</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Vietnamese-American\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Vietnamese-American\">Vietnamese-American</a> populations (the latter centered around St. Joseph Vietnamese Catholic Church).\n</p><p>Redbud Valley Nature Preserve is also located in this part of the city.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Westside\">Westside</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Neighborhoods_of_Tulsa,_Oklahoma&amp;action=edit&amp;section=36\" title=\"Edit section: Westside\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/West_Tulsa,_Tulsa,_Oklahoma\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"West Tulsa, Tulsa, Oklahoma\">West Tulsa, Tulsa, Oklahoma</a></div>\n<p>Communities of Tulsa's west side in city limits are <a href=\"/wiki/Red_Fork,_Oklahoma\" title=\"Red Fork, Oklahoma\">Red Fork</a>, Carbondale, Garden City, and <a href=\"/wiki/Turkey_Mountain_(Oklahoma)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Turkey Mountain (Oklahoma)\">Turkey Mountain</a>.

The classic art deco <a href=\"/wiki/Webster_High_School_(Tulsa,_Oklahoma)\" title=\"Webster High School (Tulsa, Oklahoma)\">Webster High School</a> is here, as is the popular train-themed Ollie\u2019s Station Restaurant, sitting next to the Tulsa rail yard. Other schools in West Tulsa include Berryhill High School, Remington Elementary, Robertson Elementary, Park Elementary and Clinton Middle School. Webster is the oldest existing high school facility in Tulsa, and has an active alumni association. Portions of Route 66 pass through west side. The area is broken up into several sections, including Carbondale and Red Fork, among others.\n</p><p>The Riverparks system, also here on the bank of the river, includes the Riverwest Festival Park, with its floating stage amphitheater overlooking downtown. Riverwest is home to such popular events as Tulsa's <a href=\"/wiki/Oktoberfest\" title=\"Oktoberfest\">Oktoberfest</a>, one of the largest of its kind in <a href=\"/wiki/North_America\" title=\"North America\">North America</a>, and the Gatesway Balloon Festival.\n</p><p>Tulsa's westside is also home to The Oaks Country Club, one of Tulsa's three major country clubs, and Inverness Village, a large <a href=\"/wiki/Retirement_community\" title=\"Retirement community\">retirement community</a>.
