The art of flag throwing dates back to medieval guilds (principally in Italy, Germany and Flanders). A guild's banner or flag was considered a symbol of purity, and as such it was not allowed to touch the ground. There are two major categories of flag throwing: classical and acrobatical.  In classical flag throwing, the flag is turned left and right around the body in a standing posture.  In acrobatical flag throwing, the thrower uses both hands to move the flag in a sitting, laying, or kneeling posture.
