A stunt coordinator, usually an experienced stunt performer, is hired by a TV, film or theatre director or production company for stunt casting that is to arrange the casting (stunt players and stunt doubles) and performance of stunts for a film, television programme or a live audience. Where the film requires a stunt, and involves the use of stunt performers, the Stunt Coordinator will arrange the casting and performance of the stunt, working closely with the Director. In many cases, the stunt coordinator budgets, designs and choreographs the stunt sequence to suit the script and the director's vision. There are two Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Stunt Coordinationâ€”one for Outstanding Stunt Coordination for a Drama Series, Miniseries or Movie and another for Outstanding Stunt Coordination for a Comedy Series or Variety Program.
