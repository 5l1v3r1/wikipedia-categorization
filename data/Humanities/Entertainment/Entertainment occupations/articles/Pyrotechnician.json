The specific requirements for certification, along with any restrictions or prohibitions, however, can vary wildly from one jurisdiction to the next. Most jurisdictions do require some type of minimum professional fireworks training before being allowed to apply for certification.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Australia\">Australia</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Pyrotechnician&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Australia\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In <a href=\"/wiki/Australia\" title=\"Australia\">Australia</a>, individuals using, handling or storing pyrotechnics must receive government certification. All individuals must meet certain minimum requirements, including being at least 18 years of age and having received approved training, including working under the direct supervision of a licensed pyrotechnician, before being issued a license. All pyrotechnicians are required to maintain a log of their experience and to submit this log annually during the license renewal process.\n</p><p>There is a push to form a recreational pyrotechnic association, ARPA (Australian Recreational Pyrotechnic Association) that would benefit those who do not wish to shoot professional displays or acquire a professional license and would rather discharge smaller consumer fireworks that do not pose a higher risk as the professional devices. The association still has guidelines and requirements that form part of a safety strategy, but less training and expenses would be the benefit of the association as individuals do not need the training that the professional devices require.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Canada\">Canada</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Pyrotechnician&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Canada\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In <a href=\"/wiki/Canada\" title=\"Canada\">Canada</a>, individuals using, handling or storing pyrotechnics must receive government certification, administered by the Explosives Regulatory Division of <a href=\"/wiki/Natural_Resources_Canada\" title=\"Natural Resources Canada\">Natural Resources Canada</a>. All individuals must meet certain minimum requirements, including being at least 18 years of age and having received government training, before being issued a license. All pyrotechnicians, of any classification or certification, are required to maintain a log of their experience.   \n</p><p>Certification for the use of proximate (indoor) pyrotechnics in Canada is separate from certification for display <a href=\"/wiki/Fireworks\" title=\"Fireworks\">fireworks</a>, and different government training and certification must be obtained.\n</p><p>The available licenses for the use of proximate pyrotechnics are sub-divided into one of 6 categories.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Pyrotechnician\">Pyrotechnician</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Pyrotechnician&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Pyrotechnician\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>The Pyrotechnician classification is the primary classification in Canada. Individuals may use a restricted list of pyrotechnics individually, but may fabricate, handle, and set up a broader list of pyrotechnics typically prohibited to the pyrotechnician under the direct supervision of a higher-licensed individual. After two years of verifiable experience with a sufficient assortment of pyrotechnics, pyrotechnicians may apply for advancement to Senior Pyrotechnician certification. Certification is valid for five years.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Senior_Pyrotechnician\">Senior Pyrotechnician</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Pyrotechnician&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Senior Pyrotechnician\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>The Senior Pyrotechnician classification is the intermediate classification in Canada. Individuals can supervise other pyrotechnicians and use any pyrotechnic device or product approved for use in Canada, and may also fabricate, handle, and set up a special-purpose or custom-fabricated pyrotechnics typically prohibited while under the direct supervision of a Special Effects Technician. After two years of verifiable experience with a sufficient assortment of pyrotechnics, pyrotechnicians may apply for advancement to Special Effects Technician certification.

Individuals may use any pyrotechnic device or product approved for use in Canada, and may also fabricate, handle, and set up a special-purpose or custom-fabricated pyrotechnics device typically prohibited. A Special Effects Technician may also apply for special certification to use restricted material, such as detonating cord and exploding bolts.

Visitor Cards are valid for one year.\n</p><p>Alternately, pyrotechnicians based outside of Canada may apply for Canadian certification, provided they meet the minimum requirements and attend the Explosive Regulatory Division certification training.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"United_States\">United States</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Pyrotechnician&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: United States\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>There is no national certification or licensing requirements for pyrotechnicians in the United States, however, many individual states implement their own certification or licensing programs. Not all states have <a href=\"/wiki/Reciprocity_(cultural_anthropology)\" title=\"Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)\">reciprocity</a> agreements in regards to honouring another state's certification, so it is not uncommon for pyrotechnicians to have certifications from multiple states. Certain states require certification to store, handle and operate <a href=\"/wiki/Fireworks\" title=\"Fireworks\">fireworks</a> but not proximate (indoor) pyrotechnics; other states use the same certification for all pyrotechnics.\n</p><p>Professional pyrotechnic companies typically have licenses issued by the <a href=\"/wiki/Bureau_of_Alcohol,_Tobacco,_Firearms_and_Explosives\" title=\"Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives\">Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives</a> with regard to manufacturer and distribution of pyrotechnic materials.
