The Production Manager of a band is in charge of the technical crew. The technical crew moves independently of the band because the technical crew must arrive at the gig location by the morning of the show to start setting up the equipment. The band members usually arrive much later, just before the event itself. As the tour is being planned, the Production Manager must contract for services such as lighting, sound, trucking, rigging, bussing, and catering. The competition is fierce between the companies offering such services. Specific discussions must take place between the Production Manager and the providers clarifying the quality of the equipment, management and crew, as well as the prices bid.  At this point the tour manag, as the technical success of the tour depends on the crew members working together effectively and efficiently.
