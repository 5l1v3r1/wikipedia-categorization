In contrast to the other forms of <a href=\"/wiki/Trapeze\" title=\"Trapeze\">trapeze</a>, on static trapeze the bars and ropes mainly stay in place.\n</p><p>Most often, the static trapeze is about 1.5 feet wide and the bar is generally 2 inches in diameter.  The ropes are at least two human lengths, as many figures are performed on the ropes above the bar.  The ropes can be made of many materials, including cotton or hemp, and often have a wire woven inside.\nIt can be performed by a single artist or two partners working together. A single artist will do tricks above and below the bar, the ropes playing just as important a part as the bar. A partner act will involve the partners working together \u2014 supporting each other's weight, throwing, lifting and catching each other. \n</p><p>Self-standing trapezes can be purchased for home use.\n</p>\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:CJ_triple_trapeze_May.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/CJ_triple_trapeze_May.jpg/300px-CJ_triple_trapeze_May.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/CJ_triple_trapeze_May.jpg/450px-CJ_triple_trapeze_May.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/CJ_triple_trapeze_May.jpg/600px-CJ_triple_trapeze_May.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"640\" data-file-height=\"480\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:CJ_triple_trapeze_May.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Triple trapeze at <a href=\"/wiki/Circus_Juventas\" title=\"Circus Juventas\">Circus Juventas</a></div></div></div>\n<p><b>Multiple trapeze</b> is an act entailing the use of more than one <a href=\"/wiki/Trapeze\" title=\"Trapeze\">trapeze</a>, typically two or three. In these acts, multiple people perform simultaneously.\nThe most common type of multiple trapeze is a \"triple trapeze\". A triple trapeze has one long bar, held up by a ropes, basically three trapezes put together, with the middle trapeze sharing the ropes of the other two. Multiple trapeze can also refer to an abstract structure with trapeze like structures, inside which multiple artists may perform.\n</p><p>An experimental cage-like structure was created by  <a href=\"/wiki/Cirque_du_Soleil\" title=\"Cirque du Soleil\">Cirque du Soleil</a> for their show <a href=\"/wiki/Varekai\" title=\"Varekai\">Varekai</a>, but was ultimately scrapped in production.

Therefore, there are four ropes connecting this trapeze to its frame, or whatever it is hanging from. Performers specialize in synchronized tricks.
