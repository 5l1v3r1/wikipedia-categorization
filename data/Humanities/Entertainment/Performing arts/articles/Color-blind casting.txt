 Nontraditional casting, integrated casting, or sometimes color-blind/gender-blind casting is the practice of casting without considering the actor's ethnicity, skin color and/or gender. A representative of the Actors' Equity Association has disputed the use of the term "color blind", preferring the definition "nontraditional casting". Nontraditional casting "is defined as the casting of ethnic minority actors in roles where race or ethnicity is not germane".  The Non-Traditional Casting Project was founded in 1986 to examine problems of racial discrimination in theatre, film and television.  The Actors' Equity Association is a co-founder.
