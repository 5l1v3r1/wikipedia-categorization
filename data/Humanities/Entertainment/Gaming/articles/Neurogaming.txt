Neurogaming is a nascent form of gaming that involves the use of Brainâ€“computer interfaces such as EEG so that users can interact with the game without use of a traditional controller.   When using Multiplayer mode players can see the brain activity of other users.  Neurogaming can have applications in treating brain disorders like PTSD and ADHD.  Besides health industry neurogaming technologies represent interest to other various sectors like defense, sports   and education.  "The player becomes a virtual agent in the game.. In the classroom it translates into a form of differentiated instruction."  One of the earliest neurogames is the racing game NeuroRacer, which was designed by Adam Gazzaley to improve the cognitive functioning of aging adults.  Other early neurogames include "Throw Trucks With Your Mind" (which allows users to pick up and throw objects by mentally blocking distractions) and NeuroMage, which allows users to use a "relax the mind" technique to learn new spells and levitate the Millennium Falcon. There is an annual conference around neurogaming based in San Francisco.  Among possible dangers and concerns surrounding neurogaming are ethical issues like mind control, brain intrusion and mind reading.
