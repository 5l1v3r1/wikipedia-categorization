PMS Clan (formerly Psychotic Man Slayerz, now Pandora’s Mighty Soldiers) was born from the camaraderie of finding other girl gamers in a male dominated online gaming community. Because of the original sparseness of women in the online gaming community, and the amount of harassment female gamers are submitted to, the PMS Clan was founded to provide a competitive, fun and positive environment for female gamers.  Since its inception in 2002, PMS has become one of the most recognized female oriented Clans in the world. Members from all walks of life are integrated into one community, sharing one passion – gaming.
