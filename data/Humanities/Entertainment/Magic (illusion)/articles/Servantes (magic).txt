Servantes are theatrical properties or "props" used by magicians. Their purpose is to assist the magician to misdirect the audience.  An example of a "prop" is a simple bag or pouch hanging from the magician's belt or a small platform placed out of sight of onlookers (behind a magician's table).  Some magicians keep their props in plain sight; a ring may be used to keep the pouch open.    Common items stored in the servante are playing cards, cups, or balls. Other magicians keep their servantes concealed to enhance the illusion.
