 Furry conventions are organized gatherings of furries. Below is an incomplete list of current and discontinued furry conventions. Furry conventions are distinct from comic book conventions, anime conventions,  science fiction conventions, gaming conventions, horror conventions and multigenre conventions. Active events are annual conventions that have been held over the last 12 months, and those scheduled for the next 12 months, where at least one outside source has discussed the convention as a whole.
