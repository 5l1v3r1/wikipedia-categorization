Thus tricks such as the one ball cascade toss back and forth, 300,  for example, may not be considered valid patterns. Throws back and forth shower style, odd numbers, are the most common one prop practice. Invalid or practice patterns and tricks are marked with an X. The numbers are as follows:  Symbols: A pattern is symmetrical (S) if both hands play the same role and asymmetrical (A) if not. All asynchronous patterns whose periods are odd are symmetrical, and all asynchronous patterns whose periods are even are asymmetrical.
