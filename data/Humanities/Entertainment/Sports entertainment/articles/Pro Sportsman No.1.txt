Pro Sportsman No. 1 (最強の男は誰だ!壮絶筋肉バトル!!スポーツマンNo.1決定戦, Saikyō no Otoko wa Dare da! Sōzetsu Kinniku Batoru!! Supōtsuman Nanbā Wan Ketteisen, "Who is the Strongest Man?! Grand Muscle Battle!! Sportsman #1 Determining Battle") is an annual program made by Monster9, the same company that produces series such as Kinniku Banzuke and SASUKE and broadcast on TBS TV. It is traditionally held on New Year's Day. Competitors take on a series of physical and mental events, where better performance is rewarded with more points. Examples of events include "Tail Impossible", a running race where the last few competitors are eliminated every lap, and "Shotgun Touch", where competitors must try to catch up to a falling volleyball. Whoever has the most points at the end of the competition wins. In 2010, Monster9 held a "Monster Box Special" rather than the traditional format. 50 competitors were invited, including several members of Muscle Musical and three SASUKE All-Stars. Whoever could survive the Monster Box the longest was declared the winner. Occasionally, international competitors will be invited. Notable international competitors include American decathletes Paul Terek and Bryan Clay, and Philadelphia Phillies outfielder Shane Victorino.
