 Nitro Circus is an "action sport collective" led by Travis Pastrana, featuring his friends and him traveling around the world riding dirtbikes, base jumping, and performing stunts. It has spawned a tour, a second television series based on the tour, and a 3D feature film. The collective began by releasing about 10 DVDs during the early 2000s.   Good sales led to the creation of the television show. Originally run as a 2006 miniseries on Fuel TV, it began running as an episodic reality television show on MTV that featured people performing various dangerous stunts. Nitro Circus officially debuted on February 8, 2009; Season 2 premiered on August 27, 2009. Nitro Circus: The Movie 3D was released August 8, 2012 in the United States and November 15, 2012 in Australia and New Zealand for one week.  Release dates for other countries are to be announced.   Jim DeChamp suffered a serious back injury on June 29, 2011, while shooting for the 3D film. After undergoing surgery, his doctors indicated there was no spinal damage and that they expect him to make a full recovery.  Damien Starkey and Paul Phillips, both ex-Puddle of Mudd members, scored the movie and provided the majority of the music. This was done through Starkey's company Give 2 Get Music. Nitro Circus Live is a reality television show. It follows Travis Pastrana and the Nitro Circus crew as they perform live all around the world. Nitro World Games is an action sports competition held annually since 2016 at Rice-Eccles Stadium in Salt Lake City, featuring freestyle motocross, BMX, kick scooter and skateboard competitions.
