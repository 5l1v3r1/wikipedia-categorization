My Dad Is Better Than Your Dad was a reality sports TV show on NBC that premiered on February 18, 2008. The show was produced by Mark Burnett, producer of other shows like Survivor, The Apprentice, and Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?, and was hosted by actor Dan Cortese.  Four teams of children and their fathers competed in each episode, with the winning team having the chance to win up to $50,000. The series was cancelled on April 2, 2008 after NBC announced its 2008-2009 schedule.  Four dads, paired up with their kids, compete in each episode, playing in stunts and answering questions, in what may have been a cross between Double Dare and American Gladiators. During the third episode's first-round stunt, "Uphill Battle" (in which dads had three minutes to push as many balls up a hill into giant holes), contestant Al Gaines had a very strong lead over his opponents at the start, but towards the end, he ended up struggling to get more balls down the holes, even at the urging of his son. At the end of the round, it was quite apparent that Gaines was suffering from a heart attack, as teaser trailers show him being rushed from the Sony studios to an ambulance. According to the rules, if a father or child is unable to compete, a replacement family takes their place. The replacement family was the Gavero Family.
