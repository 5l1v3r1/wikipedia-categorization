Nickelodeon Robot Wars is a game show that aired on Nickelodeon from August 25, 2002 to October 6, 2002. Hosted by Dave Aizer, the show was Nickelodeon's take on Robot Wars, the popular and long-running robot-fighting game show. The show was canceled after one season, and subsequently aired on Nickelodeon GAS. The series of six shows was filmed at Shepperton Studios in England in January 2002 at the same time as the second season of the Robot Wars: Extreme Warriors series shown on The New TNN American television network (now Spike). Both shows featured American teams and robots flown to England for the filming. Seven different tournaments took place over the six show series. Most of the tournaments aired within a single show, but a few spread out over multiple shows. The show featured robot competitors familiar to fans of the American series of Robot Wars, such as 'Rosie The Riveter' and 'The Revolutionist,' but the robot operators were all children associated with the teams. To suit the younger audience, a few adjustments and changes were made to the arena and House Robots.
