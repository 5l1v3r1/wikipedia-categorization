The Titan Games is an upcoming sports competition series set to air on NBC. Starring Dwayne Johnson, the show will feature people from across the United States competing in an arena against one of 6 reigning "Titans" in a series of endurance-based mental and physical challenges of "epic proportions". If successful, the competitor will become a member of the group of Titans, who will have to defend their title every week against new competitors in order to remain in the group. The season finale will feature the remaining Titans challenge one another to determine the last male and female standing.  The format is similar to that of American Gladiators and its 2008 remake. NBC has ordered 10 episodes of the series. Filming is set to commence in September 2018. The show is set to premiere in January 2019.
