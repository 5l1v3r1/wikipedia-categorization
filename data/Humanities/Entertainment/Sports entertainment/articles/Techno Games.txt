 Techno Games is a robot competition television programme that aired on BBC Two from 20 March 2000 to 28 March 2003. It is a spin-off from the hugely successful Robot Wars. Schools, colleges, individuals and technology clubs competed to break world records, win medals and the grand series prize. For most events lifelike movement was required, so, for example, in the swimming event propellers were banned in favour of legs, paddles, flippers and fins. Not all the events appeared in all of the series.
