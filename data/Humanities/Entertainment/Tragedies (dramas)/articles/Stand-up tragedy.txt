Stand-up tragedy is a style of tragic performance where a performer performs in front of a live audience, speaking directly to them.  The goal of Stand-up tragedy is to make the audience members cry.  Stand-up tragedy performances are usually long and employ the use of various media such as video, audio, highly emotional monologues and rants where the performer recites a fast-paced succession of tragic and disturbing stories.  Stand-up tragedy is often performed in bars, nightclubs, private homes, art museums, galleries and universities.  The origin of the term Stand up tragedy is unknown.  The comedian Brother Theodore (1906â€“2001) used the term to describe his comedic act which was dark, and had an absurdist edge.  The Beat poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti (1919-) often refers to himself as a "stand-up tragedian",   and performance artist Bryan Lewis Saunders uses it to describe his own act in a more literal sense of the term.
