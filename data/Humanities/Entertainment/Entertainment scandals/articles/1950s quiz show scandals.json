The quiz show scandals were driven by a variety of reasons. Some of those reasons included the drive for financial gain, the willingness of contestants to \"play along\" with the assistance, and the lack of then-current regulations prohibiting the rigging of game shows.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Venanzi_1-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Venanzi-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In 1954, the <a href=\"/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States\" title=\"Supreme Court of the United States\">U.S. Supreme Court</a> ruled in <i>Federal Communications Commission v.

The prizes of these new shows were unprecedented. <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_$64,000_Question\" title=\"The $64,000 Question\">The $64,000 Question</a></i> became the first big-money <a href=\"/wiki/Television\" title=\"Television\">television</a> quiz show during the 1950s. In 1955, <a href=\"/wiki/Joyce_Brothers\" title=\"Joyce Brothers\">Joyce Brothers</a> first earned fame by becoming the first woman to earn the $64,000 prize. It was revealed later that the show was \"controlled\"; the producers did not want her to win and deliberately gave her questions perceived to be beyond her ability, which she answered correctly anyway. <i>The $64,000 Question</i> was one of the game shows ultimately implicated to be fixed in some fashion.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Venanzi_1-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Venanzi-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In 1956, the <a href=\"/wiki/Jack_Barry_(television_personality)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Jack Barry (television personality)\">Jack Barry</a>-hosted game show <i><a href=\"/wiki/Twenty-One_(game_show)\" title=\"Twenty-One (game show)\">Twenty-One</a></i> featured a contestant, <a href=\"/wiki/Herb_Stempel\" title=\"Herb Stempel\">Herb Stempel</a>, who had been coached by producer <a href=\"/wiki/Dan_Enright\" title=\"Dan Enright\">Dan Enright</a> to allow his opponent, <a href=\"/wiki/Charles_Van_Doren\" title=\"Charles Van Doren\">Charles Van Doren</a>, to win the game.

While Stempel was in the midst of his winning streak, both of the $64,000 quiz shows were in the top-ten rated programs but <i>Twenty-One</i> did not have the same popularity. Enright and his partner Albert Freedman were searching for a new champion to replace Stempel to boost ratings. They soon found what they were looking for in Charles Van Doren. Van Doren was an English teacher at <a href=\"/wiki/Columbia_University\" title=\"Columbia University\">Columbia University</a> when a friend suggested he try out for a quiz show. Van Doren decided to try out for the quiz show <i><a href=\"/wiki/Tic-Tac-Dough\" title=\"Tic-Tac-Dough\">Tic-Tac-Dough</a>.</i> Enright, who produced both <i>Tic-Tac-Dough</i> and <i>Twenty-One</i>, saw Van Doren's tryout and was familiar with his prestigious family background that included multiple <a href=\"/wiki/Pulitzer_Prize\" title=\"Pulitzer Prize\">Pulitzer Prize</a>-winning authors and highly respected professors at Columbia University. As a result, Enright felt that Van Doren would be the perfect contestant to be the new face of <i>Twenty-One</i>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>As part of their plan, the producers of <i>Twenty-One</i> arranged the first Van Doren-Stempel face-off to end in three ties. This strategy paid off as millions of viewers tuned in the next week to watch. After achieving winnings of $69,500, Stempel's scripted loss to the more popular Van Doren occurred on December 5, 1956. One of the questions Stempel answered incorrectly involved the winner of the <a href=\"/wiki/27th_Academy_Awards\" title=\"27th Academy Awards\">1955</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Academy_Awards\" title=\"Academy Awards\">Academy Award</a> for <a href=\"/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture\" title=\"Academy Award for Best Picture\">Best Motion Picture</a>. (The correct answer was <i><a href=\"/wiki/Marty_(film)\" title=\"Marty (film)\">Marty</a></i>, one of Stempel's favorite movies; as instructed by Enright, Stempel gave the incorrect answer <i><a href=\"/wiki/On_the_Waterfront\" title=\"On the Waterfront\">On the Waterfront</a></i>, winner of Best Motion Picture the <a href=\"/wiki/26th_Academy_Awards\" title=\"26th Academy Awards\">previous year</a>).  Although the manipulation of the contestants on <i>Twenty-One</i> helped the producers maintain viewer interest and ratings, the producers had not anticipated the extent of Stempel's resentment at being required to lose the contest against Van Doren.<sup id=\"cite_ref-autogenerated2_9-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-autogenerated2-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> After his preordained loss, Stempel spoke out against the operation, claiming that he deliberately lost the match against Van Doren on orders from Enright.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources. (January 2016)\">citation needed</span></a></i>&#93;</sup>\n</p><p>Initially, Stempel was dismissed as a sore loser, due in part to the fact that there was no solid reason to question the reputations of the quiz shows themselves. In August 1958 the abrupt cancellation of the quiz show <i>Dotto</i> bolstered his credibility. Edward Hilgemeier, Jr, a stand-by contestant on <i>Dotto</i> in May 1958, sent an affidavit to the Federal Communications Commission claiming that while backstage, he had found a notebook containing the very answers contestant <a href=\"/wiki/Marie_Winn\" title=\"Marie Winn\">Marie Winn</a> was delivering on stage in that episode.<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> Although the reason for <i>Dotto</i>'s August cancellation was never given to the press, it was worked out in the days after that the reason was the implication that the game had been fixed.  The story of fixing was widely known soon after. The American public's reactions were quick and powerful when the quiz show fraud became public: between 87% and 95% knew about the scandals as measured by industry-sponsored polls.<sup id=\"cite_ref-BoddyFiftiesTelevision_11-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-BoddyFiftiesTelevision-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Over the course second half of 1958, quiz shows implicated by the scandal were canceled rapidly. Among them, with their cancellation dates, were the following shows:\n</p>\n<ul><li><i>Dotto</i> (August 16)</li>\n<li><i>The $64,000 Challenge</i> (September 14)</li>\n<li><i>Twenty-One</i> (October 16)</li>\n<li><i>The $64,000 Question</i> (November 9)</li>\n<li><i>Tic-Tac-Dough,</i> primetime edition (December 29)</li></ul>\n<p>Late in August, New York prosecutor Joseph Stone convened a <a href=\"/wiki/Grand_jury\" title=\"Grand jury\">grand jury</a> to investigate the allegations of the fixing of quiz shows. At the time of the empaneling, neither being a party to a fixed game show nor fixing a game show in the first place were crimes in their own right. Some witnesses in the grand jury acknowledged their role in a fixed show, while others denied it, directly contradicting one another. Many of the coached contestants, who had become celebrities due to their quiz show success, were so afraid of the social repercussions of admitting the fraud that they were unwilling to confess to having been coached, even to the point of perjuring themselves to avoid backlash. Show producers, who had legally rigged the games to increase ratings but did not want to implicate themselves, the show sponsors, or the networks they worked for in doing so, categorically denied the allegations. After the nine-month grand jury, no indictments were handed down, and the judge sealed the grand jury report in Summer 1959.<sup id=\"cite_ref-:0_5-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:0-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The <a href=\"/wiki/86th_United_States_Congress\" title=\"86th United States Congress\">86th United States Congress</a>, by then in its first session, soon responded; in October 1959, the <a href=\"/wiki/House_Subcommittee_on_Legislative_Oversight\" title=\"House Subcommittee on Legislative Oversight\">House Subcommittee on Legislative Oversight</a>, under Representative <a href=\"/wiki/Oren_Harris\" title=\"Oren Harris\">Oren Harris</a>'s chairmanship, began to hold hearings investigating the scandal. Stempel, Snodgrass, and Hilgemeier all testified.<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> Van Doren, initially reluctant, finally agreed to testify also.\n</p><p>The gravity of the scandal was confirmed on November 2 when Van Doren said to the Committee in a nationally televised session that \"I was involved, deeply involved, in a deception. The fact that I too was very much deceived cannot keep me from being the principal victim of that deception, because I was its principal symbol.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Aftermath\">Aftermath</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=1950s_quiz_show_scandals&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Aftermath\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Law_and_politics\">Law and politics</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=1950s_quiz_show_scandals&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Law and politics\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The entire matter was called \"a terrible thing to do to the American people\" by President <a href=\"/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower\" title=\"Dwight D. Eisenhower\">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-14\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup> The rapid growth of television as a new technology in the 1950s occurred at such a rate that laws and prohibitions could not keep up. This medium was so new that people recognized neither its dangers nor its potential for manipulation. All of the regulations regarding television at that time were defined under the Federal Communications Act of 1934, which dealt with the advertising, fair competition, and labeling of broadcast stations. The Act and regulations written by the <a href=\"/wiki/U.S._Federal_Communications_Commission\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"U.S. Federal Communications Commission\">U.S. Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC) were indefinite in regards to fixed television programs. Due to the fact that there were no specific laws regarding the fraudulent behavior in the quiz shows, it is debatable whether the producers or contestants alike did anything wrong. Instead, it could be inferred that the medium was ill-used.<sup id=\"cite_ref-autogenerated2_9-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-autogenerated2-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>After concluding the Harris Commission investigation, Congress passed a law prohibiting the fixing of quiz shows (and any other form of contest).<sup id=\"cite_ref-15\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup> These public hearings triggered amendments passed to the Communications Act in 1960. Therefore, the bill that President Eisenhower signed into law on September 13, 1960, was a fairly mild improvement to the broadcast industry. It allowed the FCC to require license renewals of less than the legally required three years if the agency believes it would be in the public interest, prohibited gifts to FCC members, and declared illegal any contest or game with intent to deceive the audience.<sup id=\"cite_ref-autogenerated2_9-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-autogenerated2-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> However, at the time, while the actions may have been disreputable, they were not illegal. As a result, no one went to prison for rigging game shows. The individuals who were prosecuted were charged because of attempts to cover up their actions, either by <a href=\"/wiki/Obstruction_of_justice\" title=\"Obstruction of justice\">obstruction of justice</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Perjury\" title=\"Perjury\">perjury</a>.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources.

Barry was effectively <a href=\"/wiki/Blacklisting\" title=\"Blacklisting\">blacklisted</a> from national television until 1969. Enright went to <a href=\"/wiki/Canada\" title=\"Canada\">Canada</a> to continue working in television, and was unable to get a job in American television until 1975.\n</p><p>Although he went through a difficult five-year period (according to an interview with <i><a href=\"/wiki/TV_Guide_(magazine)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"TV Guide (magazine)\">TV Guide</a></i> before his death in 1984), Barry moved to <a href=\"/wiki/Los_Angeles\" title=\"Los Angeles\">Los Angeles</a>, eventually finding work on local television. He would later admit in an article in <i>TV Guide</i> that, in order to determine if he still had a bad reputation (because of the requirement to have a license with the FCC), he raised money to buy a <a href=\"/wiki/Redondo_Beach,_California\" title=\"Redondo Beach, California\">Redondo Beach</a> radio station. Barry returned to hosting with <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Generation_Gap\" title=\"The Generation Gap\">The Generation Gap</a></i> in 1969 and had success with <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Joker%27s_Wild\" title=\"The Joker&#39;s Wild\">The Joker's Wild</a></i>, which premiered in 1972. Barry and Enright resumed their partnership full-time in 1976. Their production of game shows, notably the syndicated <i>Tic-Tac-Dough</i> (which Barry did not host) and <i>Joker</i> (which he did) in the 1970s and 1980s resulted in millions of dollars in revenue and, more importantly for both, forgiveness from the public for their involvement in the scandals.\n</p><p>Indeed, Barry and Enright were able to sponsor the teen-sex comedy film <i><a href=\"/wiki/Private_Lessons_(1981_film)\" title=\"Private Lessons (1981 film)\">Private Lessons</a></i>, based on <a href=\"/wiki/Dan_Greenberg\" title=\"Dan Greenberg\">Dan Greenberg</a>'s novel <i><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Philly_(novel)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Philly (novel) (page does not exist)\">Philly</a></i> and starring <a href=\"/wiki/Eric_Brown_(actor)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Eric Brown (actor)\">Eric Brown</a> alongside <a href=\"/wiki/Sylvia_Kristel\" title=\"Sylvia Kristel\">Sylvia Kristel</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Howard_Hesseman\" title=\"Howard Hesseman\">Howard Hesseman</a>, using revenue from their renewed success.\n</p><p>Other producers met the same fate as Barry and Enright, but were unable to redeem themselves afterwards.

Narz, who passed a lie-detector test at the time of the <i>Dotto</i> affair, had an extensive career as a game show host after the incident (as did his brother <a href=\"/wiki/Tom_Kennedy_(television_presenter)\" title=\"Tom Kennedy (television presenter)\">Tom Kennedy</a>), retiring in 1982; he died in October 2008 after suffering two massive strokes. <a href=\"/wiki/Sonny_Fox\" title=\"Sonny Fox\">Sonny Fox</a>, the original host of <i>The $64,000 Challenge</i>, left that show long before it could become tainted and became a popular children's host in the northeast, remembered best as the suave, genial host of the Sunday morning learn-and-laugh marathon <i><a href=\"/wiki/Wonderama\" title=\"Wonderama\">Wonderama</a></i>. Fox's replacement, <a href=\"/wiki/Ralph_Story\" title=\"Ralph Story\">Ralph Story</a>, went on to become a newscaster for KNXT-TV/<a href=\"/wiki/KCBS-TV\" title=\"KCBS-TV\">KCBS-TV</a> in Los Angeles.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Television\">Television</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=1950s_quiz_show_scandals&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Television\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The quiz show scandals exhibited the necessity for an even stronger network control over programming and production. Quiz show scandals also justified and accelerated the growth of the networks' power over television advertisers concerning licensing, scheduling and sponsorship of programs. The networks claimed to be ignorant and victims of the quiz show scandals. The NBC president at the time stated, \"NBC was just as much a victim of the quiz show frauds as was the public.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-17\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-17\">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Quiz shows virtually disappeared from <a href=\"/wiki/Prime_time\" title=\"Prime time\">prime time</a> American television for decades. Those that continued to air had substantially reduced prizes, and many shows adopted limits on the number of games a player could win (usually five, the amount of programs that could make up one broadcast week). <i>Quiz</i> shows became <i>game</i> shows, shifting focus from knowledge to puzzles and word games. NBC's comedy/game show <i><a href=\"/wiki/Jackpot_Bowling\" title=\"Jackpot Bowling\">Jackpot Bowling</a></i> and ABC's more serious <i><a href=\"/wiki/Make_That_Spare\" title=\"Make That Spare\">Make That Spare</a>!</i> were the only big-money game shows still on television after the fallout; as <a href=\"/wiki/Bowling\" title=\"Bowling\">bowling</a> is not a game that can easily be rigged for television, those shows continued to air into the early 1960s. A quiz for big money would not return until <a href=\"/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company\" title=\"American Broadcasting Company\">ABC</a> premiered <i><a href=\"/wiki/100_Grand_(game_show)\" title=\"100 Grand (game show)\">100 Grand</a></i> in 1963; it went off the air after three weeks.\n</p><p>It would not be until the late 1960s that five-figure prizes would again be offered on American television, and not until the late 1970s that six-figure prizes could be won. ABC limited a contestant's winnings to $30,000 (although contestants were retired after winning $20,000) before removing the limit in 1984. CBS initially limited a contestant's winnings to $25,000 beginning in 1972; contestants were allowed to keep up to $10,000 (and later $25,000) in excess of the limit, which would increase to $50,000 in 1984, to $75,000 in 1986, and to $125,000 in 1990 (with no money being allowed above the limit) before being eliminated in 2006. NBC never utilized a winnings limit on any of its game shows but kept cash and prizes within a reasonable range that created a <i>de facto</i> limit (for instance until its 1989 NBC cancellation, <i><a href=\"/wiki/Wheel_of_Fortune_(U.S._game_show)\" title=\"Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)\">Wheel of Fortune</a></i> forced contestants to cash in their winnings per round on presented merchandise or apply it to a gift certificate, or build their winnings for a later round at the risk of losing those winnings on penalties such as a \"Bankrupt\" spin). Some syndicated game shows also used a winnings limit (for example, contestants on <i><a href=\"/wiki/Jeopardy!\" title=\"Jeopardy!\">Jeopardy!</a></i> were not allowed to win more than a specific amount of money in regular play between 1984 and 2003).\n</p><p>The demise of the big-money quiz shows also gave rise to television's newest phenomenon: <a href=\"/wiki/Westerns\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Westerns\">westerns</a>.\n</p><p>The disappearance of quiz shows, many of which were (apparent) demonstrations of highbrow intelligence, and their replacement by dumbed-down game shows may have been one of many factors in the end of the <a href=\"/wiki/Golden_Age_of_Television\" title=\"Golden Age of Television\">Golden Age of Television</a>; by 1960, numerous television critics were lamenting the rise of a <a href=\"/wiki/Vast_wasteland\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Vast wasteland\">vast wasteland</a> of lowbrow television.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Rigging_in_other_countries\">Rigging in other countries</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=1950s_quiz_show_scandals&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Rigging in other countries\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"United_Kingdom\">United Kingdom</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=1950s_quiz_show_scandals&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: United Kingdom\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In 1958, <a href=\"/wiki/ITV_(TV_network)\" title=\"ITV (TV network)\">ITV</a> pulled its version of <i>Twenty-One</i> almost immediately after contestant Stanley Armstrong claimed that he had been given \"definite leads\" to the answers. In 1960, this resulted in the Independent Television Authority's placement of a permanent winnings cap for ITV game shows of \u00a31,000, which the Independent Broadcasting Authority increased to \u00a36,000 in 1981 (though the British version of <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_$64,000_Question_(UK_game_show)\" title=\"The $64,000 Question (UK game show)\">The $64,000 Question</a></i> did receive special permission to offer \u00a36,400 when it premiered in 1990). The winnings cap was permanently eliminated by the Independent Television Commission in 1993.\n</p><p>For many decades, British game shows earned a reputation for being cheap, low-budget affairs that focused more on entertainment than actual game play and prizes, in large part because of the restrictions put on game shows following the scandal. In addition to prize limits, games of chance were also largely forbidden, meaning that a number of American game shows could not be faithfully reproduced in the UK. The lifting of these limits initially allowed more American shows to be adapted into British versions, and within a few years, the rise of game shows with much higher prize limits - most notably <i><a href=\"/wiki/Who_Wants_to_Be_a_Millionaire%3F\" title=\"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\">Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</a></i>, would originate largely in the UK and make its way to the U.S. in the late 1990s.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=1950s_quiz_show_scandals&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Quiz_channel#2007_television_phone-in_scandals\" title=\"Quiz channel\">2007 British television phone-in scandal</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/American_game_show_winnings_records\" title=\"American game show winnings records\">American game show winnings records</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/College_Bowl\" title=\"College Bowl\">College Bowl</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Martin_Flood\" title=\"Martin Flood\">Martin Flood</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Charles_Ingram\" title=\"Charles Ingram\">Charles Ingram</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Jay_Jackson\" title=\"Jay Jackson\">Jay Jackson</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Michael_Larson\" title=\"Michael Larson\">Michael Larson</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Quizbowl\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Quizbowl\">Quizbowl</a></li>\n<li><i><a href=\"/wiki/Slumdog_Millionaire\" title=\"Slumdog Millionaire\">Slumdog Millionaire</a></i></li>\n<li><i><a href=\"/wiki/Quiz_Show_(film)\" title=\"Quiz Show (film)\">Quiz Show</a></i></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=1950s_quiz_show_scandals&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap mw-references-columns\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-Venanzi-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\">^ <a href=\"#cite_ref-Venanzi_1-0\"><sup><i><b>a</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Venanzi_1-1\"><sup><i><b>b</b></i></sup></a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><cite class=\"citation web\">Venanzi, Katie (1997). <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.plosin.com/beatbegins/projects/venanzi.html\">\"An Examination of Television Quiz Show Scandals of the 1950s\"</a><span class=\"reference-accessdate\">.
