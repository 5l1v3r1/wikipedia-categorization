Due to the arrangement of the booths and the studio lighting, the contestants could not see or hear each other or the audience. At any given moment during the game, one booth would be \"open,\" meaning that the occupant could hear the host in the headphones and be heard by him through the booth's microphone. The other booth would be \"closed,\" with its microphone disabled and the headphones playing music so that the occupant could not hear the game.\n</p><p>The game was played in rounds, with Barry announcing the category for each round as it was dispensed from a machine on his podium; there were over 100 possible categories. The challenger played first in each round, with their booth open and the champion's closed, and selected the point value (1 to 11) they wanted to attempt. Higher-value questions were more difficult, and questions often had several parts. If the challenger answered correctly, the points were added to their score; a miss subtracted the points, but the score could never go below zero. The challenger's booth was then closed and the champion's opened so they could take a turn. Barry did not tell either contestant about the other's score or performance.\n</p><p>The goal was to earn a total of 21 points. If the challenger reached this score first, their booth was left open to hear the champion's turn, but they were cautioned not to speak or give away any information. Barry did not tell the champion that the challenger had already reached 21 unless the champion asked for a question that would give him or her 21 points if answered correctly. If the champion failed to match that score, the challenger won. The champion won by reaching 21 first on their own turn. If a round ended in a 21\u201321 tie, the scores were erased and a new game was played. Contestants were given extra time to think on any question that would bring them up to 21.\n</p><p>After two rounds, both booths were opened and the contestants were given a chance to stop the game. If either of them asked to do so, the contestant in the lead was declared the winner. The game was automatically stopped after five rounds.\n</p><p>The winner of the game received $500 per point in the margin of victory (e.g., a 21\u201315 win paid $3,000). Whenever a game ended in a tie, the stakes were raised by $500 per point and a new game was played. If the champion won, they could choose to leave the show with all winnings intact or play again, basing this decision on a small amount of information about the next challenger. However, if the challenger won, their winnings for that game were paid out of the defeated champion's total.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"2000_version\">2000 version</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Twenty-One_(game_show)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: 2000 version\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Questions were still worth 1 to 11 points, but all main-game questions were multiple-choice, with no \"multiple-part\" questions. Questions worth 6 or fewer points had one correct answer out of three choices. Questions worth 7 to 10 points had one correct answer out of four choices; for 10-point questions, \"None of the above\" was an option. Questions worth 11 points had <i>two</i> correct answers out of five, and both were required.\n</p><p>Incorrect answers no longer deducted points from a contestant's score. Instead, contestants received a strike for each incorrect response; accumulating three strikes resulted in an automatic loss. This rule change meant that games could end without a winner, as the rounds again were played to completion. If one contestant had struck out on their turn and the second contestant had two strikes, they could also lose the game on an incorrect answer. However, a contestant did not know how their opponent had struck out unless explicitly told by the host.<sup id=\"cite_ref-note_1-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Each contestant could call for a \"Second Chance\" once per game, allowing an opportunity to receive help from a friend or family member before answering. An incorrect response on a Second Chance penalized the contestant with two strikes instead of one. If the challenger struck out, and the champion had either one or two strikes and had not yet used their Second Chance, the round was played to completion since they could still strike out.\n</p><p>Games were still played to a maximum of five rounds, and beginning with the second episode, contestants had the option to stop the game after the second round if neither had reached 21. If time ran out during a game and at least two complete rounds had been played, the contestant in the lead was declared the winner and advanced to the Perfect 21 bonus round at the beginning of the next episode.\n</p><p>Unlike the 1950s version, if the game ended in a tie, no new game was played. Instead, the contestants would be asked one question, and the first contestant to ring-in got to answer. If right, he or she won the game and went on to play the bonus round; an incorrect answer gave the opponent a chance to respond. If both contestants missed the question, a new one was asked.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Payoff\">Payoff</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Twenty-One_(game_show)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Payoff\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>Losing challengers received $1,000 as a consolation prize. Rather than receiving a dollar value multiplied by the point difference after winning each game, champions received progressively larger amounts for each opponent defeated. Originally, the payoff structure was as follows:\n</p>\n<table class=\"wikitable\">\n\n<tbody><tr>\n<th style=\"width:94px\">Game number\n</th>\n<th style=\"width:65px\">Prize\n</th></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1\n</td>\n<td>$100,000\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2\n</td>\n<td>$200,000\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3\n</td>\n<td>$300,000\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4\n</td>\n<td>$400,000\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>These amounts accumulated, so winning four games would be worth $1,000,000. After winning a fourth game, the contestant started the chain again at $100,000 for defeating a fifth opponent, $200,000 for defeating a sixth, and so on.\n</p><p>After a few early episodes, the prize ladder changed to the following:\n</p>\n<table class=\"wikitable\">\n\n<tbody><tr>\n<th style=\"width:94px\">Game number\n</th>\n<th style=\"width:65px\">Prize\n</th></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1\n</td>\n<td>$25,000\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2\n</td>\n<td>$50,000\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3\n</td>\n<td>$100,000\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4\n</td>\n<td>$250,000\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5\n</td>\n<td>$500,000\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6\n</td>\n<td>$750,000\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7\n</td>\n<td>$1,000,000\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>These amounts accumulated, so winning seven games would be worth at least $2,675,000. As before, any contestant who defeated a seventh opponent started from the beginning of the chain.\n</p><p>When the rules changed, the returning champion had won one game and $100,000 in his appearance on the final show under the old prize structure. Instead of being \"grandfathered\" under the old prize structure, he played and won his second game for $250,000 (the next amount after $100,000), and played but lost his third game for $500,000.\n</p><p>Under both prize structures, champions remained on the show until being defeated, and new champions' winnings were not deducted from the totals of dethroned ones.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Contestant_selection\">Contestant selection</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Twenty-One_(game_show)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Contestant selection\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>During the first six episodes, the audience chose the winner's next opponent. The audience would be presented with two potential challengers to face the current champion, and the audience would vote for an opponent using keypads. The person who received the higher vote played against the champion; the other person would be one of the two potential challengers to be voted on for the next game. In the first episode, there were three potential opponents to face the champion. After the sixth episode, the process was changed to a random selection. At the beginning of the show, six potential challengers would be introduced, and would be selected randomly from that group for each new game. People who had not been selected by the end of the show were not guaranteed to return on the following show, although some people did appear on the show multiple times before being selected to play.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Bonus_round:_Perfect_21\">Bonus round: Perfect 21</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Twenty-One_(game_show)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Bonus round: Perfect 21\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>The champion was asked a maximum of six true/false questions in a single category, starting at one point and increasing by one per question to a maximum value of six. After any correct answer, the champion could stop playing and receive $10,000 per point; an incorrect answer ended the round and forfeited this money. Correctly answering all six questions won the top prize of $210,000.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Big_winners\">Big winners</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Twenty-One_(game_show)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Big winners\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Under the first payoff structure, Rahim Oberholtzer was the biggest winner, collecting $1,120,000 (at the time, the all-time game show winnings record) over four victories, three of which were due to his opponents striking out.\n</p><p>David Legler won $1,765,000 over six wins with the new payout structure.

The producers ordered him to answer the question with <a href=\"/wiki/26th_Academy_Awards\" title=\"26th Academy Awards\">1954</a>'s Best Motion Picture winner, <i><a href=\"/wiki/On_the_Waterfront\" title=\"On the Waterfront\">On the Waterfront</a></i>.\nStempel later recalled that there was a moment in the booth when his conscience and sense of fair play warred with his sense of obligation and that he almost disrupted the scripted outcome by giving the correct answer. Stempel answered incorrectly as he was instructed, but redeemed himself by staying in the game and earning enough points to tie Van Doren's score, unlike the depiction of events in <i>Quiz Show</i>. Stempel was finally defeated in the next game, with Van Doren leading: the surviving <a href=\"/wiki/Kinescope\" title=\"Kinescope\">kinescope</a> of the broadcast shows Stempel failing to come up with the title of <a href=\"/wiki/William_Allen_White\" title=\"William Allen White\">William Allen White</a>'s August 15, 1896, editorial in the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Emporia_Gazette\" title=\"Emporia Gazette\">Emporia Gazette</a></i>, \"What's the Matter with Kansas?\" After the missed question, Van Doren quit with 18 points, which was enough to win. Van Doren's victory began one of the longest and most storied runs of any champion in the history of television game shows. Van Doren's popularity soared as a result of his success on <i>Twenty-One</i>, earning him a place on the cover of <a href=\"/wiki/Time_Magazine\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Time Magazine\"><i>Time</i> magazine</a> and even a regular feature spot on NBC's <a href=\"/wiki/Today_(NBC_program)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Today (NBC program)\"><i>Today</i></a> show; at one point, the program even surpassed <a href=\"/wiki/CBS\" title=\"CBS\">CBS</a>' <i><a href=\"/wiki/I_Love_Lucy\" title=\"I Love Lucy\">I Love Lucy</a></i> in the ratings. He was finally unseated as champion by Vivienne Wax Nearing (1926\u20132007) on March 11, 1957, after winning a total of $129,000 (the equivalent of $1,124,012 today).\n</p><p>In the meantime Stempel, disgruntled over being ordered to \"take a dive\", attempted to blow the whistle on what exactly was going on behind the scenes at <i>Twenty-One</i>, even going so far as to have a federal investigator look into the show. Initially, little came of these investigations and Stempel's accusations were dismissed as jealousy because there was no hard evidence to back up his claims. While a congressional investigation did affect <i>Twenty-One</i> during this period, the investigation in question was the <a href=\"/wiki/HUAC\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"HUAC\">HUAC</a> hearings into possible Communists in entertainment; the show's director, <a href=\"/wiki/Charles_S._Dubin\" title=\"Charles S. Dubin\">Charles S. Dubin</a>, was fired by NBC in June 1958, after he refused to answer whether he ever had been part of the Communist party.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ousted_5-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ousted-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In August 1958 <i><a href=\"/wiki/Dotto\" title=\"Dotto\">Dotto</a></i>, a popular <a href=\"/wiki/CBS\" title=\"CBS\">CBS</a> daytime game show, was abruptly canceled after a contestant found a notebook containing the answers to every question that was to be asked to the show's current champion, future journalist <a href=\"/wiki/Marie_Winn\" title=\"Marie Winn\">Marie Winn</a>. Stempel's allegations about <i>Twenty-One</i> began to gain credulity. A grand jury was convened in Autumn 1958 to investigate <i>Dotto</i> and other possible game show fixing, investigated by Joseph Stone, assistant New York district attorney. Stone says in his book <i>Prime Time and Misdemeanors</i> that question writer Glorianne Rader was instructed by Dan Enright and associate producer Al Freedman, who had chosen the categories for the next broadcast earlier in the week, to place them in Barry's dispensing machine a few minutes before airtime; this was done to avoid any slipups in the planned outcome. Stone reached out to former contestants of <i>Twenty-One</i>, including one Richard Jackman. Jackman, asked by Enright if he would tell the truth if approached by Stone, said that he would confess to the fixing of <i>Twenty-One</i>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-:0_3-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:0-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> Three days after Jackman confessed to Stone,<sup id=\"cite_ref-:0_3-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:0-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> and without advance public warning, <i>Twenty-One</i> was canceled after its broadcast of October 17, 1958, amid plummeting ratings. A nighttime version of <i><a href=\"/wiki/Concentration_(game_show)\" title=\"Concentration (game show)\">Concentration</a></i> took over its time slot the following week.\n</p><p>Further eroding Barry and Enright's claims of honesty, another former contestant, James Snodgrass, came forward with corroborating proof the show was rigged: in a series of registered letters he had mailed to himself, Snodgrass documented each and every answer he was coached on prior to air time and testified to the fact in front of Congress in 1959.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The scandal forced producers Barry and Enright into virtual exile.  Barry would not host another national TV show for more than a decade, and Enright moved to <a href=\"/wiki/Canada\" title=\"Canada\">Canada</a> to continue his production career.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Aftermath\">Aftermath</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Twenty-One_(game_show)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10\" title=\"Edit section: Aftermath\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>The scandal also caused the <a href=\"/wiki/Federal_Communications_Commission\" title=\"Federal Communications Commission\">Federal Communications Commission</a> to mandate the sale of Barry-Enright's <a href=\"/wiki/Radio\" title=\"Radio\">radio</a> station in <a href=\"/wiki/Hollywood,_Florida\" title=\"Hollywood, Florida\">Hollywood, Florida</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/WLQY\" title=\"WLQY\">WGMA</a> (now WLQY). The station was purchased by its general manager, C. Edward Little, who promptly affiliated the station with the <a href=\"/wiki/Mutual_Broadcasting_System\" title=\"Mutual Broadcasting System\">Mutual Broadcasting System</a>. After serving for a time as the head of Mutual's affiliates association, Little became the president of Mutual from 1972\u201379. During this time Little created the <a href=\"/wiki/Mutual_Black_Network\" title=\"Mutual Black Network\">Mutual Black Network</a>, the first U.S. broadcast network catering exclusively to African-Americans, in addition to the Mutual Spanish Network and the Mutual Southwest Network. Under Little's administration, Mutual became the first commercial broadcasting entity to use <a href=\"/wiki/Satellite\" title=\"Satellite\">satellite</a> technology for program delivery. During his tenure as head of Mutual, Little hired <a href=\"/wiki/Larry_King\" title=\"Larry King\">Larry King</a> to host an all-night phone-in talk show Little had created. King was a one-time announcer for Little at WGMA. King, who had previously hosted a similar morning show on Miami radio station WIOD, went on to national fame on both radio and television, winning a coveted <a href=\"/wiki/Peabody_Award\" title=\"Peabody Award\">Peabody Award</a> along the way.\n</p><p>Jack Barry finally returned to game show hosting in 1969, succeeding <a href=\"/wiki/Dennis_Wholey\" title=\"Dennis Wholey\">Dennis Wholey</a> on ABC's <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Generation_Gap\" title=\"The Generation Gap\">The Generation Gap</a></i> for which he publicly thanked the producers and ABC-TV for giving him a chance for a comeback. In 1971, he sold ABC his first new game show <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Reel_Game\" title=\"The Reel Game\">The Reel Game</a></i> which he also hosted. It ran for 13 weeks. He became a success again as a producer-host with <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Joker%27s_Wild\" title=\"The Joker&#39;s Wild\">The Joker's Wild</a></i>, which ran on CBS from 1972\u20131975 and in syndication from 1977\u20131986 (Barry died in May 1984 and was replaced by <a href=\"/wiki/Bill_Cullen\" title=\"Bill Cullen\">Bill Cullen</a> for the final two years). Enright would work as <i>Joker</i><span class=\"nowrap\" style=\"padding-left:0.1em;\">&#39;</span>s executive producer in the final year on CBS, and the two revived their partnership full-time in 1976, reviving <i><a href=\"/wiki/Tic-Tac-Dough\" title=\"Tic-Tac-Dough\">Tic-Tac-Dough</a></i> which also ran until 1986. It was revived once more in 1990, but was cancelled after a few months.

The contestant promptly requested and successfully answered a 1-point question (the easiest question possible), accompanied by the applause of the audience and a clear expression of chagrin and horror on Povich's face as he realized the mistake he had made (as he was not supposed to say anything until after the question choice was made). Immediately after a commercial break, Povich acknowledged his mistake in revealing to the contestant that his opponent had already lost, but explained that the only effect had been essentially to give a \"gift\" to that contestant since his opponent had already lost the game and was not affected by the mistake.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-2\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.classictvhits.com/tvratings/1957.htm\">http://www.classictvhits.com/tvratings/1957.htm</a></span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-:0-3\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\">^ <a href=\"#cite_ref-:0_3-0\"><sup><i><b>a</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-:0_3-1\"><sup><i><b>b</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-:0_3-2\"><sup><i><b>c</b></i></sup></a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><cite class=\"citation web\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/quizshow/peopleevents/pande04.html\">\"The American Experience | Quiz Show Scandal | People &amp; Events | Dan Enright\"</a>. <i>www.pbs.org</i><span class=\"reference-accessdate\">.
