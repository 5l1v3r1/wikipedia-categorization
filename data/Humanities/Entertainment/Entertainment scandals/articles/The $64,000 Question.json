It was first hosted by <a href=\"/wiki/Bob_Hawk\" title=\"Bob Hawk\">Bob Hawk</a> (1940\u201341), followed by <a href=\"/wiki/Phil_Baker_(comedian)\" title=\"Phil Baker (comedian)\">Phil Baker</a> (1941\u201347).\n</p><p>Contestants were asked questions devised by the series' writer-researcher Edith Oliver. She attempted to make each question slightly more difficult than the preceding one. After answering a question correctly, the contestant had the choice to \"take\" the prize for that question or \"leave it\" in favor of a chance at the next question. The first question was worth one dollar, and the value doubled for each successive question, up to the seventh and final question worth <a href=\"/wiki/United_States_dollar\" title=\"United States dollar\">$64</a>.\n</p><p>During the 1940s, \"That's the $64 question\" became a common <a href=\"/wiki/Catchphrase\" title=\"Catchphrase\">catchphrase</a> for a particularly difficult question or problem. In addition to the common phrase \"Take it or leave it\", the show also popularized another phrase, widely spoken in the 1940s as a taunt but now mostly forgotten (except in <a href=\"/wiki/Warner_Bros.\" title=\"Warner Bros.\">Warner Bros. cartoons</a>). Chanted in unison by the entire audience when someone chose to risk their winnings by going for the $64 prize, it was vocalized with a rising inflection: \"You'll be sorrr-REEEE!\"\n</p><p>The popularity of the radio program inspired a 1944 <a href=\"/wiki/20th_Century_Fox\" title=\"20th Century Fox\">20th Century Fox</a> feature film, <i><a href=\"/wiki/Take_It_or_Leave_It_(1944_film)\" title=\"Take It or Leave It (1944 film)\">Take It or Leave It</a></i>, about a man who needs $1,000 to pay his wife's obstetrician. When he is chosen as a contestant on the radio quiz show, the prize money is increased beyond the usual $64.\n</p><p>In 1947, the series switched to NBC, hosted at various times by Baker, <a href=\"/wiki/Garry_Moore\" title=\"Garry Moore\">Garry Moore</a> (1947\u201349), <a href=\"/wiki/Eddie_Cantor\" title=\"Eddie Cantor\">Eddie Cantor</a> (1949\u201350) and <a href=\"/wiki/Jack_Paar\" title=\"Jack Paar\">Jack Paar</a> (beginning June 11, 1950). On September 10, 1950, the title of <i>Take It or Leave It</i> was changed to <i>The $64 Question</i>. Paar continued as host, followed by Baker (March\u2013December 1951) and Paar (back on December 1951). The series continued on NBC Radio until June 1, 1952.\n</p><p>Only two recordings of <i>Take It or Leave It</i> are known to survive.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"The_.2464.2C000_Question\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_$64,000_Question\"><i>The $64,000 Question</i></span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=The_$64,000_Question&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: The $64,000 Question\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><i>The $64,000 Question</i> was created by Louis G. Cowan, formerly known for radio's <i><a href=\"/wiki/Quiz_Kids\" title=\"Quiz Kids\">Quiz Kids</a></i> and the television series <i><a href=\"/wiki/Stop_the_Music_(TV_series)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Stop the Music (TV series)\">Stop the Music</a></i> and <i><a href=\"/wiki/Down_You_Go\" title=\"Down You Go\">Down You Go</a></i>. He drew the inspiration for the name from the earlier show \"Take It or Leave It\", and its $64 top prize offering. He decided to expand the figure to $64,000 for the new television program.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> Cowan had difficulty locating sponsorship for <i>The $64,000 Question</i>. Cosmetics giant <a href=\"/wiki/Helena_Rubenstein\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Helena Rubenstein\">Helena Rubenstein</a>, which eventually did become a familiar television advertiser, rejected the idea, reportedly because its wealthy founding namesake did not own a television set at the time and had no idea of the medium's advertising potential. The <a href=\"/wiki/Chrysler_Corporation\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Chrysler Corporation\">Chrysler Corporation</a> turned down the chance to launch the show because the automaker reportedly feared sponsoring a big-money quiz show would outrage company workers whose wages they were trying not to inflate. A vacuum cleaner company also said no to Cowan, reportedly because the concept would be too glamorous for its product.\n</p><p>Finally, Cowan convinced <a href=\"/wiki/Revlon\" title=\"Revlon\">Revlon</a>. The key: Revlon founder and chieftain <a href=\"/wiki/Charles_Revson\" title=\"Charles Revson\">Charles Revson</a> knew top competitor <a href=\"/wiki/Hazel_Bishop\" title=\"Hazel Bishop\">Hazel Bishop</a> had fattened its sales through sponsoring the popular <i><a href=\"/wiki/This_Is_Your_Life\" title=\"This Is Your Life\">This Is Your Life</a></i>, and he wanted a piece of that action if he could have it. According to <i>Fire and Ice</i><sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> (1976), <a href=\"/wiki/Andrew_Tobias\" title=\"Andrew Tobias\">Andrew Tobias</a>' biography of Revson, Revlon first signed a deal to sponsor Cowan's brainchild for 13 weeks with the right to withdraw when they expired.\n</p><p><i>The $64,000 Question</i> premiered June 7, 1955 on CBS-TV, sponsored by cosmetics maker Revlon and originating from the start live from CBS-TV Studio 52 in New York (later the disco-theater <a href=\"/wiki/Studio_54\" title=\"Studio 54\">Studio 54</a>). The first contestant on the show was Thelma Farrell Bennett, a housewife from <a href=\"/wiki/Trenton,_New_Jersey\" title=\"Trenton, New Jersey\">Trenton, New Jersey</a> who failed to make it to the first plateau but won a 1955 Cadillac convertible.\n</p><p>To increase the show's drama and suspense, it was decided to use an actor rather than a broadcaster as the host. Television and film actor <a href=\"/wiki/Hal_March\" title=\"Hal March\">Hal March</a>, familiar to TV viewers as a supporting regular on <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_George_Burns_and_Gracie_Allen_Show\" title=\"The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show\">The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show</a></i> and <i><a href=\"/wiki/My_Friend_Irma_(radio-TV)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"My Friend Irma (radio-TV)\">My Friend Irma</a></i>, found instant fame as the quiz show's host, and Lynn Dollar stood nearby as his assistant. Author and TV panelist <a href=\"/wiki/Bergen_Evans\" title=\"Bergen Evans\">Dr. Bergen Evans</a> was the show's expert authority, and actress <a href=\"/wiki/Wendy_Barrie\" title=\"Wendy Barrie\">Wendy Barrie</a> did the \"Living Lipstick\" commercials. (Coincidentally, in 1978, Evans and Barrie died within 72 hours of each other.) To capitalize on the initial television success, the show was also simulcast for two months on CBS Radio where it was heard from October 4, 1955 to November 29, 1955.\n</p><p>The J. Fred &amp; Leslie W. MacDonald Collection of the <a href=\"/wiki/Library_of_Congress\" title=\"Library of Congress\">Library of Congress</a> contains one kinescoped episode featuring Virgil Earp, elderly nephew of <a href=\"/wiki/Wyatt_Earp\" title=\"Wyatt Earp\">Wyatt Earp</a>, winning $32,000.  It was broadcast in early 1958.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Gameplay\">Gameplay</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=The_$64,000_Question&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Gameplay\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Contestants first chose a subject category (such as \"Boxing\", \"Lincoln\" or \"Jazz\") from the Category Board. Although this board was a large part of the set, it was seen only briefly, evidently to conceal the fact that categories were sometimes hastily added to match a new contestant's subject.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> The contestant would then be asked questions only in the chosen category, earning money which doubled ($64, $128, $256 to $512, then $1,000, $2,000, $4,000, $8,000, $16,000, $32,000 to $64,000) as the questions became more difficult. At the $4,000 level, a contestant would return each week for only one question per week. They could quit at any time and retire with their money, but until they won $512, if they got a question wrong, they were eliminated without winning anything. Missing a question worth between $1,000 and $4,000 left the contestant with $512. Once the contestant won $4,000, if they missed a question they received a <a href=\"/wiki/Consolation_prize\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Consolation prize\">consolation prize</a> of a new <a href=\"/wiki/Cadillac_(automobile)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cadillac (automobile)\">Cadillac</a>. Starting with the $8,000 question, they were placed in the <a href=\"/wiki/Revlon\" title=\"Revlon\">Revlon</a> \"<a href=\"/wiki/Isolation_booth\" title=\"Isolation booth\">isolation booth</a>\", where they could hear nothing but the host's words. As long as the contestant kept answering correctly, they could stay on the show until they had won $64,000. The first contestant to win the top prize money, on September 13, 1955, was Richard S. McCutchen, a <a href=\"/wiki/United_States_Marines\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"United States Marines\">Marine</a> whose subject was <a href=\"/wiki/Cooking\" title=\"Cooking\">cooking</a>.

Regarded as one of the <a href=\"/wiki/Golden_Age_of_Television\" title=\"Golden Age of Television\">Golden Age of Television</a>'s best quiz show parodies, the <i>Honeymooners</i> episode depicted Kramden spending a week intensively studying popular songs, only to blow the first question on the subject when he returned to play on the show.

A <i>Challenge</i> contestant, Rev. Charles Jackson, told the federal grand jury probing the quiz shows that he received answers during his screening for his appearance. That prompted <i>Challenge'</i>s sponsor, the <a href=\"/wiki/Lorillard_Tobacco_Company\" title=\"Lorillard Tobacco Company\">Lorillard Tobacco Company</a> (Kent, Old Gold cigarettes), to drop the show.\n</p><p><i>The $64,000 Question</i> had the opposite problem: sponsor <a href=\"/wiki/Revlon\" title=\"Revlon\">Revlon</a>\u2014possibly under pressure from its chieftain, Charles Revson, who has been credited with expressing the desire for famous faces that prompted <i>Challenge'</i>s expansion to include celebrities\u2014often tried to interfere with the production of <i>Question</i>, including and especially trying to bump contestants it simply disliked, no matter whether the audience liked them. Revson's brother, Martin, was assigned to oversee <i>Question</i>\u2013including heavy discussions of feedback the show received. The would-be bumpees included Joyce Brothers herself, who managed to outwit the question writers and Revlon long enough to win the maximum prize.\n</p><p>According to producer Joe Cates in a PBS documentary on the scandals, he used an IBM sorting machine to give the illusion that the questions were randomly selected \u2013 in fact, all of the cards were identical.

Unlike <i>Twenty-One</i> and <i>Dotto</i>, where contestants got the answers in advance, Revlon was reportedly far more subtle: they may have depended less on asking questions on the air that a contestant had already heard in pre-air screenings than on switching the questions kept secure in a bank vault at the last minute, to make sure a contestant the sponsor liked would be suited according to his or her chosen expertise.\n</p><p>The most prominent victim may have been the man who launched the franchise in the first place. Louis Cowan, made CBS Television president as a result of <i>Question'</i>s fast success, was forced out of the network as the quiz scandal ramped up, even though it was <a href=\"/wiki/NBC\" title=\"NBC\">NBC</a>'s and not CBS' quiz shows bearing the brunt of the scandal \u2013 and even though CBS itself, with a little help from sponsor <a href=\"/wiki/Colgate-Palmolive\" title=\"Colgate-Palmolive\">Colgate-Palmolive</a>, had moved fast in cancelling the popular <i><a href=\"/wiki/Dotto\" title=\"Dotto\">Dotto</a></i> at almost the moment it was confirmed that that show had been rigged. Cowan had never been suspected of taking part in any attempt to rig either <i>Question</i> or <i>Challenge</i>; later CBS historians suggested his reputation as an administrative bottleneck may have had as much to do with his firing as his tie to the tainted shows. Cowan may have been a textbook sacrificial lamb, in a bid to preempt any further scandal while the network scrambled to recover, and while president <a href=\"/wiki/Frank_Stanton_(executive)\" title=\"Frank Stanton (executive)\">Frank Stanton</a> accepted complete responsibility for any wrongdoing committed under his watch.\n</p><p>The quiz show scandals ultimately resulted in a \"shift in the power to program television\". The networks used the scandal as an argument to eliminate the abuse of sponsor controlled programming in prime-time broadcasting, which would then allow the networks to take control of program production into their own hands.<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Aftermath\">Aftermath</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=The_$64,000_Question&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11\" title=\"Edit section: Aftermath\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>By the end of 1959, all first generation big-money quizzes were gone with single-sponsorship television following and a federal law against fixing television game shows (an amendment to the 1960 Communications Act) coming.

However, the questions in <i>Millionaire</i> are of a broader variety than <i>Question'</i>s one-category line of questioning and have a different category for each question, contestants are allowed to leave the game with their money after a question is revealed but before it is answered, and <i>Millionaire</i> offers three chances for help (called \"lifelines\"), which were not present in <i>Question</i>.\n</p><p>In 2000, responding to the success of <i>Millionaire</i>, <a href=\"/wiki/CBS\" title=\"CBS\">CBS</a> bought the rights to the property in a reported effort to produce another revival attempt, <i>The $1,064,000 Question</i>, to be hosted by <a href=\"/wiki/Sportscaster\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sportscaster\">sportscaster</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Greg_Gumbel\" title=\"Greg Gumbel\">Greg Gumbel</a>.
