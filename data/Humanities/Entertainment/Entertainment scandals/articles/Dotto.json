The champion and the challenger were both given their own version of the portrait, which contained fifty dots for each contestant to connect. The contestants were positioned on stage in a manner where neither one could see the other or their progress. There was also an overhead projector on stage that was called the \"Dottograph\", which would come into play as the game progressed.\n</p><p>Play in each game started with the challenger and he/she was given a category along with a choice of three questions, each with a corresponding number of dots to connect. The questions were worth five, eight, or ten dots and more dots meant a higher difficulty. Answering correctly enabled the challenger to have his/her dots connected, but a wrong answer or failure to answer gave that privilege to the champion. \n</p><p>To further assist the contestants in identifying the subjects of the portrait, three clues were provided. These were unlocked once a contestant reached a certain number of connections. The first required a total of twenty-five connections, the second thirty-five, and the last forty-five.\n</p><p>At any point in the game, including during the opposing player's turn, a contestant could signal that he/she knew the answer by pressing a button. Narz would then direct that contestant to walk to the Dottograph, which the opposing player could not see, and write that answer on the projecto  screen.\n</p><p>After the answer was recorded, Narz would reveal if the contestant had answered correctly. If he/she did, the opponent was given one last chance to force a tie and play on by correctly identifying the subject based on his/her own progress during the game; if he/she could not do so the first contestant won the game. If the first contestant was incorrect, the opponent automatically won the game. \n</p><p>The winning player won money for each unconnected dot left on his/her picture, and the amount increased for each tie up to two. On the daytime series, the payout was $10 per dot and it doubled for each tie up to a maximum of $40. On the nighttime series, the payout was $100 per dot and increased by that amount for each tie, resulting in a maximum of $300 per dot.\n</p><p>After a game was completed, usually during the middle of each episode, a \"Home Viewer Dotto\" game was played, in which a person selected by postcard drawing was called by <a href=\"/wiki/Telephone\" title=\"Telephone\">telephone</a> live on the air for a chance to guess the person being drawn. If correct, the home viewer won a new car or other valuable prizes, and if incorrect, the viewer received a consolation prize (the daytime version gave away a supply of products advertised by the show's sponsor, <a href=\"/wiki/Colgate-Palmolive\" title=\"Colgate-Palmolive\">Colgate-Palmolive</a>, while the nighttime version gave away a <a href=\"/wiki/Tourism\" title=\"Tourism\">trip</a>).

A notebook belonging to contestant (and later journalist) <a href=\"/wiki/Marie_Winn\" title=\"Marie Winn\">Marie Winn</a> was found by stand-by contestant, Edward Hilgemeier Jr., who realized that the notebook included questions and answers to be used during Winn's appearances, one of which was against a woman named Yaffe Kimball. He tore out the relevant pages of the notebook for himself. Hilgemeier then told Kimball after her onstage loss that her competitor had been given answers in advance. Hilgemeier later reported that <i>Dotto's</i> producers paid him $1,500 to keep quiet about his discovery, and Kimball, as the loser of a fixed match, $4,000.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> <i>Dotto</i> on CBS, meanwhile, grew in popularity as 1958 went on and became the highest rated Daytime show on the air.<sup id=\"cite_ref-dottopartial2_2-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-dottopartial2-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Hilgemeier Jr. eventually decided to break his silence. He contacted the <a href=\"/wiki/Colgate-Palmolive\" title=\"Colgate-Palmolive\">Colgate-Palmolive</a> company on approximately August 8, 1958 with his story, which was then relayed to CBS. Executives at <a href=\"/wiki/CBS\" title=\"CBS\">CBS</a> and the show's sponsor quickly moved to confirm the allegation internally and worked the issue between August 11 and 16.<sup id=\"cite_ref-dottopartial2_2-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-dottopartial2-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> CBS executive vice president Thomas Fisher tested <a href=\"/wiki/Kinescope\" title=\"Kinescope\">kinescopes</a> of the show against Winn's notebook and concluded that the show looked fixed.

In interviews, host Jack Narz stated that he was not notified of <i>Dotto's</i> cancellation until some point after the final episodes had been recorded.

Stempel's statements gained more credibility once the match fixing at <i>Dotto</i> was publicized, and investigations (in the form of a grand jury, and later, congressional hearings) followed.\n</p><p>Jack Narz eventually replaced Warren Hull as host of <i>Top Dollar</i> by November 1958. That series ran in daytime until October 23, 1959. <a href=\"/wiki/Jack_Narz\" title=\"Jack Narz\">Narz</a> continued to work as a game show host for most of the next twenty years after <i>Top Dollar</i> ended.\n</p><p>Frank Cooper would never do another game show after <i>Dotto,</i> which was his longest-running game and his only one for CBS. His previous gaming efforts did not fare as well &#8211; his first game, an NBC show called <i>Guess What Happened?</i> (dropping the \"Guess\" after the first show), bombed after three episodes in 1952. <i>Droodles,</i> starring <a href=\"/wiki/Roger_Price_(comedy)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Roger Price (comedy)\">Roger Price</a>, ran for three months in 1954 while ABC's <i><a href=\"/wiki/Keep_It_in_the_Family_(U.S._game_show)\" title=\"Keep It in the Family (U.S. game show)\">Keep It in the Family</a></i> ran for four months from 1957-1958.\n</p><p>Connie Hines was revealed to have been coached for her <i>Dotto</i> appearance, but unlike Marie Winn, she was not given questions and answers in advance. She enjoyed a five-year run as Carol Post on <i><a href=\"/wiki/Mister_Ed\" title=\"Mister Ed\">Mister Ed</a></i> and, after a few subsequent television guest roles, retired from acting entirely.\n</p><p>Marie Winn eventually became a journalist whose books include <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Plug-In_Drug\" title=\"The Plug-In Drug\">The Plug-In Drug</a></i>, a scathing critique on television's influence over children.
