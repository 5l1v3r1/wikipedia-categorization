European Arenas Association (EAA) is an international association that represents 31 indoor arenas from 20 European countries. These structures must be enclosed, multifunctional, with a capacity of at least 6,000 seats, and managing to maintain high quality standards in all areas.  The European Arenas Association was formed in the early 1990s, with its main goal to create a common platform for a number of leading venues in Europe. The membership at the EAA involves a maximum of three arenas per country (until 2007, only two arenas per country were allowed). However, each of the countries of the United Kingdom is counted separately, so United Kingdom currently has five members – three from England and one from both Scotland and Northern Ireland. The main subjects of cooperation between the EAA members include commercial activities, technical and maintenance requirements, technology and market trends.  Below is a complete list of the EAA members (as of  September 2017[update]):
