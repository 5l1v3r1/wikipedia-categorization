Lion taming is the taming and training of lions either for protection, or more commonly, entertainment, particularly in the circus. The term often applies to the taming and display of other big cats such as tigers, leopards, jaguars, cheetahs, and cougars. People often use lion taming as a metaphor for a dangerous activity, due to the obvious risks of toying with powerful, instinctive carnivores. Lion taming occurs in zoos across the world, to enable the keepers to carry out medical procedures and feedings. The Captive Animals Protection Society maintains that animal welfare cannot be guaranteed in circuses.
