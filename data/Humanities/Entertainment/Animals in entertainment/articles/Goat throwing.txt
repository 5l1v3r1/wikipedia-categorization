Celebrated on the fourth Sunday of January, Goat throwing (in Spanish: Lanzamiento de cabra desde campanario or Salto de la cabra) was a festival in Manganeses de la Polvorosa, province of Zamora, Spain where a group of young men threw a live goat from the top of a church based on local legend. A crowd below would then catch the falling goat with a canvas sheet. In 2004 it was banned against animal rights and since then, toy goats have been used.  Animal rights groups demanded the end of this festival several times,   until the practice was banned in 2000. The legend states that a goat, which miraculously fed the poor with its milk, fell out of the tower, but landed safely.  A toy plush goat was thrown in the 2014 celebration.
