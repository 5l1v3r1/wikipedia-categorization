Christian comedy is a subgenre of comedy where the material presented is aimed towards a Christian audience. The performances are typically held on church grounds or at off-site, church-sponsored venues. The material often contains Christian references, although this is not a requirement. Recently, notable performers like Victoria Jackson, Tim Conway, Sinbad and Patricia Heaton have appeared on a DVD series for the Christian market entitled, "Thou Shalt Laugh"  Christian comedy is increasingly being used as an outreach, with the idea that a comedy show is a great way to bring people into church who may have never thought about coming.  Christian comedy is also used as a method to renew and refresh the spirit of church members, based on the Bible passage that says laughter does a heart good, like medicine.
