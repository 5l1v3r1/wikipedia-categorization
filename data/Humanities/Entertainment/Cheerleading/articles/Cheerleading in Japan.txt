Cheerleading is a recognized sport in Japan that requires physical strength and athletic ability.  Cheerleading is available at the junior high school, high school, collegiate, club, and all-star level. Teams can either be all female or coed featuring males and females. Competition routines are held on a 12-meter square mat in which the entire surface can be used. Each team must perform a 2 minutes and 30 seconds routine in which 1 minute and 30 seconds of the routine may contain music. Routines showcase different elements including sideline cheers, pyramids and stunts, dance, and gymnastics. There is also a division for group stunt competition where a group of five participants perform a 60–65 seconds routine of strictly stunts. There is also a division for partner stunt competition that includes one male and one female and one spotter. These routines last around 55–60 seconds and can only incorporate stunting.  On July 13, 1988 the Foundation of Japan Cheerleading Association was founded with the purpose of supervising the cheerleading world as a competitive sport in Japan and to promote a healthy spread and promotion of the cheerleading competition. The Japan Cheerleading Association (JCA) also holds cheerleading and leadership workshops, holds domestic and international competitions, trains trainers, certifies competition equipment, and handles publications.  The International Federation of Cheerleading (IFC) is also based in Tokyo, Japan and is the world governing body of cheerleading.  The Asian Federation of Cheerleading (AFC) is the governing body of cheerleading in Asia and is one of the continental confederations that makes up the International Federation of Cheerleading. It was formed in 2007 and has its headquarters in Tokyo, Japan.
