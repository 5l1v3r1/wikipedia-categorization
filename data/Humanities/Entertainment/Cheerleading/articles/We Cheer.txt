We Cheer is a dance video game published by Namco Bandai Games. The game sees the player leading a squad of cheerleaders through a routine by following lines and swirls that appear on screen by motioning the Wii Remote. For single player and two player games, two Remotes for each player (one per hand) are required, but in four player games each player can use a single Remote only.  The game has the player performing physical motions ranging from single motion thrusts, to elaborate zig-zagging actions and windmilling whole arm motions.  We Cheer also allows players to customize their cheer squad including their hair color and uniforms (though only female cheerleaders will be available), and additional outfits and squad members can be unlocked by collecting gold pompoms earned after a successful routine.  The game also features a workout mode that keeps track of the number of calories burned by the player during play.  The game features 36 licensed music tracks, including The Great Escape by Boys Like Girls, That's the Way (I Like It) by KC & the Sunshine Band, and ...Baby One More Time by Britney Spears.  The game received "mixed" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.
