American Cheerleader is the first and largest national teen magazine dedicated to covering sideline and competitive cheerleading. It was founded in 1995 and is currently based in Memphis, Tennessee. Staff includes Editor-in-Chief Jackie Martin and Managing Editor Kim Conley. Inspired by the popularity and competitive nature of cheerleading in the early 1990s, publishing executive Michael Weiskopf started a magazine to take advantage of its evolving culture. The first issue was published in New York in January 1995. It was published by Lifestyle Ventures, LLC, and the first issue featured University of Maryland cheerleader Penny Ramsey, who went on to become a castaway in Thailand on the CBS show Survivor in 2002.  Special Collector’s Editions were produced in February 2005 and February 2010 to commemorate the magazine’s 10th and 15th anniversaries. Lifestyle Media, Inc. was acquired by Macfadden Performing Arts Media, LLC in 2006. Varsity Spirit bought the magazine in 2012.   American Cheerleader covers training tips for stunting and tumbling, tryout advice, team building activities, beauty, fashion, fitness and how to balance schoolwork and cheer. All issues feature a Cheerleader of the Month, Spotlight Squad and Awesome Athletes.   Cheerleaders of the Month are recognized for their talent, academic achievement and community involvement.
