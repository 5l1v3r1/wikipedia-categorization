In spring 2011, USA Cheer announced that 21 universities are now committed to this sport.  STUNT requires high athletic skills and its competition format and scoring systems are unique. The maximum number of players on each team can reach 30 athletes. STUNT athletes are engaged from multiple backgrounds, including traditional cheerleading schools, \u201cAll Stars\u201d who are non-school cheerleaders and acrobatics and/or gymnastics athletes. STUNT is being considered for NCAA Emerging Sport status and has been designed to meet Title IX's requirements for intercollegiate sports.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#STUNT_History\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">STUNT History</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#The_four_Quarters_of_Play,_Competition_Formats_and_Routines\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">The four Quarters of Play, Competition Formats and Routines</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#The_four_quarters_of_play\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">The four quarters of play</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Competition_format\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Competition format</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#STUNT_routines&gt;\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">STUNT routines&gt;</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#General_STUNT_framework\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">General STUNT framework</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#Staff\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Staff</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#Season/Post-season\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Season/Post-season</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-9\"><a href=\"#Field_of_play\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Field of play</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-10\"><a href=\"#Equipment\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Equipment</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-11\"><a href=\"#Event_staffing\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Event staffing</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-12\"><a href=\"#Skill_rules\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Skill rules</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-13\"><a href=\"#Game/_tournament_timeline\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.7</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Game/ tournament timeline</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-14\"><a href=\"#Game_rules\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Game rules</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-15\"><a href=\"#Scoring\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Scoring</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-16\"><a href=\"#Timeouts\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Timeouts</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-17\"><a href=\"#Possession\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Possession</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-18\"><a href=\"#Playoff_for_final_score_tiebreaker\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Playoff for final score tiebreaker</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-19\"><a href=\"#Final_score\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Final score</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-20\"><a href=\"#Other_definitions\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Other definitions</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-21\"><a href=\"#See_also\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">See also</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-22\"><a href=\"#Sources\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">7</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Sources</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-23\"><a href=\"#External_links\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">8</span> <span class=\"toctext\">External links</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-24\"><a href=\"#Notes\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">9</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Notes</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"STUNT_History\">STUNT History</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Stunt_(sport)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: STUNT History\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In 2011\u20132013 University of Louisville have kept the title of Champions for Division I Stunt.

A major deduction (marked as an \u201cX\u201d) is counted for an incomplete skill or incorrect body position such as the performance of a single full twist instead of the required double full twist. A double major deduction (XX) is counted for a fall to the ground. Two minor errors equal one major error.\nThe decision of the final ranking for the round is based on combining the individual scoring official\u2019s rankings.

The points from each category are accumulated to obtain a combined score for the routine.\nIn order to obtain equal balance between quarters, the round score is multiplied by three because there is only one round in the fourth quarter.\nAt any time does one of the players who are not in the specific play steps onto the mat then they will receive a minor deduction.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Timeouts\">Timeouts</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Stunt_(sport)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=16\" title=\"Edit section: Timeouts\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>\u2022Each team gets sixty seconds timeout per half.<br />\n</p><p>\u2022Timeouts are signaled by displaying the hands in a \u201cT\u201d figuration.\n</p><p>\u2022During timeouts all teams are allowed to use their warm-up area.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Possession\">Possession</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Stunt_(sport)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=17\" title=\"Edit section: Possession\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>\u2022<b>Start of the Game</b> A random drawing by the team head coaches, overseen by the game official, determines the team that will start the game.\n</p><p>\u2022<b>Quarter Change</b> The initial possession in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th quarters is given to the team with the lowest overall game score.\n</p><p>\u2022<b>Second and Third Rounds of Each Quarter</b> The team winning the preceding round gets possession for the following round.\n</p><p>\u2022<b>Forfeits</b> If a team forfeits the round, it will automatically obtain possession for the following round.\n</p><p>\u2022<b>Ties</b> If there is a tie between two teams, the team that did not have possession in the tie round will get possession.\n</p><p>\u2022<b>Quarter Change</b> If none of the tying team had possession in that round, possession defaults to the highest point total at that time.
