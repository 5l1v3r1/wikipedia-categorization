In recent years, some schools have implemented a third and even fourth flag in routines. This performing art is mainly prominent in <a href=\"/wiki/Southern_California\" title=\"Southern California\">Southern California</a> high schools in various school districts. It is mainly in high schools but a few are in elementary, middle school and college/university levels.\n</p><p>Although pep flags has been around for many decades (and has evolved much since then), it has been gaining more and more popularity.

Not to be confused with auxiliary or <a href=\"/wiki/Colorguard\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Colorguard\">colorguard</a>, pep flags is a separate discipline. However, much like other auxiliary and spirit teams, Pep Flags takes much hand and eye coordination, athleticism, showmanship and overall teamwork and good sportsmanship. Many flag routines involve choreography to music, <a href=\"/wiki/Dance\" title=\"Dance\">dance</a>/<a href=\"/wiki/Cheer\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cheer\">cheer</a> elements (such as kicklines, pyramid mounts, etc.), numerous combinations of twirls, flag tricks, and flag tosses (also known as exchanges).\n</p><p>Many schools that have a Pep Flag squad can generally be seen performing at school pep rallies, football games (pre-game, half-time or even along the sideline with the cheerleaders), and cheering at other sporting events during the fall. Some may be seen marching with their school's band during parade season.  In the spring, teams compete in several indoor competitions against other schools. Some of the main competitions that occur are United Spirit Association (USA) Regionals and Nationals, Miss Dance Drill/Team USA, Sharp competitions as well as smaller school-sponsored competitions throughout the Southern California area. Generally, these competitions have two separate divisions for one flag and two flag routines. In addition, they may also include solo, duet, and trio divisions as well.\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Schools\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Schools</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Pep_Flags_in_media\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Pep Flags in media</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Competition_history\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Competition history</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#See_also\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">See also</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#External_links\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">External links</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Schools\">Schools</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Pep_flags&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Schools\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Adolfo_Camarillo_High_School\" title=\"Adolfo Camarillo High School\">Adolfo Camarillo High School</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Arapahoe_High_School_(Centennial,_Colorado)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Arapahoe High School (Centennial, Colorado)\">Arapahoe High School</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Arcadia_High_School_(Arcadia,_California)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Arcadia High School (Arcadia, California)\">Arcadia High School</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Bell_High_School_(Bell,_California)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Bell High School (Bell, California)\">Bell High School</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Bishop_Montgomery_High_School\" title=\"Bishop Montgomery High School\">Bishop Montgomery High School</a> earned the Championship titles at <a href=\"/wiki/Miss_Dance_Drill_Team_USA\" title=\"Miss Dance Drill Team USA\">Miss Dance Drill Team USA</a> in 1986 (Two Flag), 2014 (both one and two flag), 2017(1 Flag) and the International Championship titles in 1986 and 1990.
