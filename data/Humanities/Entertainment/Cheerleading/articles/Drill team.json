The team is one of five infantry companies that are assigned the mission to protect His Majesty the King of Norway and the royal family, as well as guarding the Royal Palace. The 3rd company, HMKG are also used to represent the Norwegian armed forces at state-related matters such as state-visits, ceremonies, national festivities, and were also prominent in the Winter World Cup 2010 as guards. As of 2012, His Majesty the King's Guard is also responsible for the safety and defence of the city of Oslo, in case of a national crisis. A total of six companies make up His Majesty The King's Guard (<a href=\"/wiki/Hans_Majestet_Kongens_Garde\" title=\"Hans Majestet Kongens Garde\">Hans Majestet Kongens Garde</a>), and is a part of the Norwegian army.\n</p><p>The band is hand picked through interviews and playing tests prior to the draft date. The band consists of signal horns, a drumline, a pit and the main band. Most of the members year goes to practising and basic military training as the year is a part of their military service. The band is probably the only troop that almost never have \"green\" duty (as in field duty). Also, the band never stand guard at the castle nor the other guarding posts around Oslo, neither does the drill platoon.\n</p><p>The drill platoon consists of 32\u201340, first-year servicing soldiers. These are all hand picked through a rigorous selection process that lasts from their drafting at the start of October till December. The soldiers go through basic military training as well as having to learn how to march, weapons drill, and how to perform synchronically. Throughout the selection process, the soldiers have to prove themselves worthy a spot on the drill team, as these soldiers will be representing not only the King's guard, but also the Norwegian military and the Norwegian state both national and internationally. Everything in their daily duty from the bed, room, facilities, closets, uniforms, and physique needs to be at excellent standards 24/7. These men strive for perfection in all that they do and are often seen running around the various woods nearby the base as well as working out at the gym. Every year, these soldiers finish their service with one of the highest average physical results in the army. Their uniforms are spotless and wrinkleless, in addition their boots are so well polished that you can literally reflect yourself in them. As opposed to what one might think, these soldiers draft year have been compared to as even harder than what the first-year service in the special forces is. Though most likely not as hard physically, the mentality and the pressure in being the best of the best puts these soldiers under a tremendous amount of pressure every hour of every day, every day of the year. Their rigorous training results in being one of the best drill teams in the world.\n</p><p>The band and drill platoon (3rd company) is the only drill team that have been invited to the legendary <a href=\"/wiki/Royal_Edinburgh_Military_Tattoo\" title=\"Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo\">Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo</a> nine times, 2012 being the most recent.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_drill_meet\">The drill meet</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Drill_team&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: The drill meet\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>A drill meet is a competition for military-style drill teams.

This grading is based strictly on the military drill manuals in use for the meet (i.e., Army TC 3-21.5, Marine Corps Order P-5060.20, Air Force Manual 36-2203, etc.) Using this evaluating technique closely parallels what most of these individuals have done throughout their military careers at various levels throughout their training (most of these evaluators come from military training facilities and/or base honor guards). Judges score teams within ranges from POOR, to AVERAGE, to EXCEPTIONAL. Most meets using this system have a \"Judge's Notes\" section where judges are either encouraged or required (depending on the meet) to write some candid notes for the team to utilize to interpret the numerical scores delivered on the score sheets.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Dance_and_semi-military_teams\">Dance and semi-military teams</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Drill_team&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: Dance and semi-military teams\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Texas\">Texas</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Drill_team&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10\" title=\"Edit section: Texas\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Dance drill teams evolved from early pep squads and military-style drum and bugle corps that performed in the stands and/or during halftimes at football games.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Gussie_Nell_Davis\" title=\"Gussie Nell Davis\">Gussie Nell Davis</a>, from <a href=\"/wiki/Farmersville,_Texas\" title=\"Farmersville, Texas\">Farmersville, Texas</a>, created a pep squad at <a href=\"/wiki/Greenville_High_School_(Texas)\" title=\"Greenville High School (Texas)\">Greenville High School</a> in <a href=\"/wiki/Greenville,_Texas\" title=\"Greenville, Texas\">Greenville</a>, Texas in 1929.

Masters, contacted Gussie Nell Davis about coming to <a href=\"/wiki/Kilgore,_Texas\" title=\"Kilgore, Texas\">Kilgore</a>, Texas, to start a group that would \u201cbe interesting and keep the folks in their seats at half-time.\u201d They also needed to recruit women to the school since the enrollment was primarily made up of men who were seeking to learn more about the oil business. Dr. Masters was not quite sure what he wanted, but he knew he did not want a traditional drum and bugle corps. He wanted something new, something that did not yet exist, and left the decisions up to Miss Davis.<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Miss Davis created the \u201c<a href=\"/wiki/Kilgore_College_Rangerettes\" title=\"Kilgore College Rangerettes\">Rangerettes</a>\" to perform at Kilgore College football game halftimes. The Rangerettes almost immediately became the gold standard for all teams, both high school and college, and almost all Texas drill teams now consist of a line of performers with the officers in front of the team leading them in at every game.\n</p><p>In <a href=\"/wiki/Tyler,_Texas\" title=\"Tyler, Texas\">Tyler</a>, Texas, just 30 miles from Kilgore, the second college drill team to be created in Texas was the <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.tjc.edu/belles/\">Tyler Junior College Apache Belles</a> in 1947.<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> A fierce but friendly rivalry between the Apache Belles and the Rangerettes developed quickly, and continues to this day.\n</p><p>Much like Miss Davis, Barbara Tidwell, a former Kilgore College Rangerette, was recruited by Southwest Texas State University (now <a href=\"/wiki/Texas_State_University\" title=\"Texas State University\">Texas State University</a>) in 1960 to create the \u201cStrutters\u201d, the first drill team at a four-year college.\n</p><p>There are over a thousand high school drill teams in the state of Texas today with over 30,000 students participating every year. The traditional uniform for these teams usually consists of a white hat with white boots. The officers of the teams also typically wear an all white uniform, while the line members wear school colors. Teams perform visual routines at football games, both in the stands during the game, and on the field at halftime. During the spring, teams often perform at basketball game halftimes, and compete in many different dance styles at competitions sponsored by dance and drill team companies.\n</p><p>Traditionally, Texas high school drill teams have been all female, but males have auditioned and been selected to teams in recent years.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"California\">California</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Drill_team&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11\" title=\"Edit section: California\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The first dance-drill teams in <a href=\"/wiki/California\" title=\"California\">California</a> were school affiliated. Teams in <a href=\"/wiki/California\" title=\"California\">California</a> now typically identify as either a pep squad, drill team, dance team, dance-drill team, or dance company. But these affiliations began to widen greatly as parks &amp; recreation programs, independent performing arts programs, and dance studios opened across the state in the late 1980s and developed their own dance-related programs. More traditional drill teams march in parades with school marching bands during the fall/winter, perform field shows (halftime shows) at athletic events, and compete at indoor dance/drill competitions during the late-winter and/or spring seasons.\n</p><p>After moving from <a href=\"/wiki/Texas\" title=\"Texas\">Texas</a> to <a href=\"/wiki/California\" title=\"California\">California</a> following her collegiate studies, drill team founder Dr. <a href=\"/wiki/Kay_Teer_Crawford\" title=\"Kay Teer Crawford\">Kay Teer Crawford</a> eventually started the world's first national precision dance-drill team competition in 1967: <a href=\"/wiki/Miss_Dance_Drill_Team_USA\" title=\"Miss Dance Drill Team USA\">Miss Dance Drill Team USA</a> (aka U.S. Nationals &amp; Pageant, MDDTUSA). In 1981, Crawford also created the world's first international dance competition: Miss Dance Drill Team International. The U.S. National dance competition and world championships are now held annually in Southern <a href=\"/wiki/California\" title=\"California\">California</a>.\n</p><p>But there are now numerous drill team &amp; dance team competition circuits in California (i.e. <a href=\"/wiki/Miss_Dance_Drill_Team_USA\" title=\"Miss Dance Drill Team USA\">Miss Dance Drill Team USA</a>, Varsity/USA/UDA, CADTD, etc.). And while most current school-affiliated teams do not compete on the festival level, those that do are consistently adjudicated in the following areas as developed by Dr. <a href=\"/wiki/Kay_Teer_Crawford\" title=\"Kay Teer Crawford\">Kay Teer Crawford</a> (Different competition circuits place different point/percentage weight on the importance of each of the following three areas in determining a final score):\n</p>\n<ul><li>Routine choreography</li>\n<li>Technical execution</li>\n<li>Showmanship</li></ul>\n<p>There are also quite a variety of categories in which a team can compete. Examples are as follows:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Jazz</li>\n<li>Lyrical</li>\n<li>Contemporary</li>\n<li>Military</li>\n<li>Kick</li>\n<li>Hip Hop</li>\n<li>Pom/songleader</li>\n<li>Character</li>\n<li>Novelty</li>\n<li>Prop</li>\n<li>Dance-drill</li>\n<li>Co-ed dance</li>\n<li>Show production</li></ul>\n<p>Unlike other states where schools are placed in separate divisions based on their school attendance size (as associated with state-organized athletic organizations), no such affiliation currently exists in California because dance is not considered an athletic sport. As a result, competition divisions are sub-divided into size of the performance group in a given routine, with teams allowed to compete in as many sizes as they wish:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Small</li>\n<li>Medium</li>\n<li>Intermediate</li>\n<li>Large</li></ul>\n<p>All teams are adjudicated on a point system, with total points deciding ordinal rankings in determining winners.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Washington\">Washington</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Drill_team&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12\" title=\"Edit section: Washington\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In Washington state, the phrase \"drill team\" usually refers to high school performance/spirit teams that compete in the \"drill\" and/or \"military\" category at local, regional and statewide \"dance/drill\" competitions. Drill routines (sometimes referred to as \"drills\") typically entail (indeed some argue <i>should</i> entail):\n</p>\n<ul><li>highly regimented procedures for entering and exiting the stage;</li>\n<li>precise symmetry and/or spacing in the team's formations (a.k.a. line straightness);</li>\n<li>precise transitions between formations that do not compromise line straightness;</li>\n<li>perfect or near-perfect synchronization and sharpness in the teams' marching and other bodily movements; and</li>\n<li>interesting music selection.</li>\n<li>(Many drill teams incorporate <a href=\"/wiki/Kickline\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Kickline\">kicklines</a> into their routines; many other successful drill routines have been accomplished without them.)</li></ul>\n<p>Judging is currently known as ordinal judging and ratings categorized by superior, exceptional, excellent, and good.\n</p><p>The WIAA Dance/Drill competition is the annual championship event for qualified dance and drill teams held annually in the last weekend of March.\n</p><p><br />A Washington drill team member, or \"driller\", is not a dancer, but a dancer can be a driller. Since the foci of drill are presentation and spatial precision, drillers do not necessarily need attributes typically ascribed to dancers, such as a high level of flexibility (although this is a large portion of what many teams exhibit in their routines and part of their score) or an aptitude for expressing emotions with the body. This generally allows for larger team sizes, with most teams having about 20 or more members.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Utah\">Utah</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Drill_team&amp;action=edit&amp;section=13\" title=\"Edit section: Utah\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In Utah, most 3A, 4A, 5A, and 6A schools have a drill team. This sport is incredibly competitive in this state, probably due to the high number of dancers. Tryouts are normally held the school year before the performing season during the months of April and May, giving teams the entire summer to work on their technique. During this time, drill teams often attend a dance camp to learn small dances to perform at school events such as sports games and assemblies. Along with these shorter routines, teams also learn longer and more technical competition routines to compete at a few invitational competitions and later a regional competition. The teams that place at the top at region (usually the top 4) go to state to compete against other teams in other regions. \n</p><p>Performed dance styles include military, kick, character, lyrical, hip hop, pom, jazz, and officer, among others.\n</p><p>Every year at region and state competitions, teams compete in military and dance, and every other year, compete in kick or character.\n</p>\n<ul><li>Dance - Dance routines feature technique and performance above all. Teams are judged on their precision, flexibility, leaps, turns, kicks, and other skills such as projection, facials, vocals, and visuals.</li>\n<li>Military - Military is a unique style and surprising at first. Military routines use intricate formations, walking patterns, arm sequences, kicks, and drop splits, and require the team to appear as one person, every move being incredibly precise and sharp. Facials are typically intense or neutral, and the music is usually instrumental. It is typically part of a marching ensemble, or marching band.</li>\n<li>Kick - A kick routine is all about legs. The majority of the routine is kicking, either in a line, partnership, or alone. Scores are based on the number of kicks in the routine, how together they are, how high they are, and how straight and pointed the legs and feet are.</li>\n<li>Character - Character is about becoming a certain person, thing, or idea and performing as such. Technique is still a priority like in other styles, but it must be done as the character. Teams are judged on how well they fit the persona, use any props, their technique, and their performance as a whole in the way of projection and facials.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Drill_team&amp;action=edit&amp;section=14\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Ceremonial_Guard\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Ceremonial Guard\">Ceremonial Guard</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Dance_squad\" title=\"Dance squad\">Dance squad</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Equestrian_drill_team\" title=\"Equestrian drill team\">Equestrian drill team</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Pep_flags\" title=\"Pep flags\">Pep flags</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Marching_girls\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Marching girls\">Marching girls</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Parade_(military)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Parade (military)\">Parade (military)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Foot_drill\" title=\"Foot drill\">Foot drill</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Military_parade\" title=\"Military parade\">Military parade</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Cadet_Kelly\" title=\"Cadet Kelly\">Cadet Kelly</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Exhibition_Drill\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Exhibition Drill\">Exhibition Drill</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Pershing_Rifles\" title=\"Pershing Rifles\">Pershing Rifles</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Blue_Ridge_Rifles\" title=\"Blue Ridge Rifles\">Blue Ridge Rifles</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Reserve_Officers%27_Training_Corps\" title=\"Reserve Officers&#39; Training Corps\">Reserve Officers' Training Corps</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Honor_guard\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Honor guard\">Honor guard</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Broom_brigade\" title=\"Broom brigade\">Broom brigade</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Notes\">Notes</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Drill_team&amp;action=edit&amp;section=15\" title=\"Edit section: Notes\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://iaxd.org/index.htm\">[1]</a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20120103135051/http://iaxd.org/index.htm\">Archived</a> January 3, 2012, at the <a href=\"/wiki/Wayback_Machine\" title=\"Wayback Machine\">Wayback Machine</a>.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-2\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.i-w-d-c.com\">[2]</a>  <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20090303234503/http://www.i-w-d-c.com/\">Archived</a> March 3, 2009, at the <a href=\"/wiki/Wayback_Machine\" title=\"Wayback Machine\">Wayback Machine</a>.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-3\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-3\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><cite class=\"citation web\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://drill.thenationals.net\">\"Drill Main Flash-like HomePage\"</a>. <i>thenationals.net</i>.</cite><span title=\"ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rft.genre=unknown&amp;rft.jtitle=thenationals.net&amp;rft.atitle=Drill+Main+Flash-like+HomePage&amp;rft_id=http%3A%2F%2Fdrill.thenationals.net&amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fen.wikipedia.org%3ADrill+team\" class=\"Z3988\"><span style=\"display:none;\">&#160;</span></span></span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-4\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-4\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><cite class=\"citation web\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.competitive-outcomes.com\">\"Competitive Outcomes -
