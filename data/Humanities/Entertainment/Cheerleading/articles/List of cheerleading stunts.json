Stunting in <a href=\"/wiki/Cheerleading\" title=\"Cheerleading\">cheerleading</a> has been previously referred to as building <a href=\"/wiki/Human_pyramid\" title=\"Human pyramid\">pyramids</a>. Stunts range from basic two-legged stunts, to one-legged extended stunts, and high flying basket tosses. There are numerous variations of each stunt, multiple entries and dismounts out of the stunt. Stunts vary at each level (level 1\u20136 according to the USASF). Each level increases the difficulty of the stunt. There are few recognized styles of stunting, coed, all-girl, and hybrid. Cheerleading teams are restricted to specific stunt rules based on the guidelines of certain associations and organizations; Therefore, some stunts may be permitted in certain divisions but illegal in others due to the different stunt regulations. The level of difficulty depends on where the teams stunt and practice as well as the organization they are a part of since cheer associations want to maintain the safety of the cheerleaders by restricting them to try stunts that are too advanced for their level.\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Athletes_involved\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Athletes involved</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Flyer\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Flyer</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Bases_and_Spotters\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Bases and Spotters</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-3 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Main_Base\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.2.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Main Base</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-3 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Secondary_Base\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.2.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Secondary Base</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-3 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#Back_Spot\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.2.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Back Spot</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-3 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#Front_Spot\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.2.4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Front Spot</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-3 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#Additional_Spot\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.2.5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Additional Spot</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-9\"><a href=\"#Types_of_stunts\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Types of stunts</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-10\"><a href=\"#Rules/Safety\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Rules/Safety</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-11\"><a href=\"#Body_positions\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Body positions</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-12\"><a href=\"#Two-and-a-half_high_stunts\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Two-and-a-half high stunts</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-13\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Athletes_involved\">Athletes involved</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=List_of_cheerleading_stunts&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Athletes involved\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>A flyer, 2 bases (usually, side and main base), and a backspot.

The flyers are usually (but not always) the smallest people on a cheerleading squad. Before beginning to stunt a flyer must learn the correct posture. A flyer must hold their own weight by pushing off of the bases shoulders and keep their chest up.<sup id=\"cite_ref-The_Basics_of_Cheerleading_Stunts_2-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-The_Basics_of_Cheerleading_Stunts-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> The flyer must control their own weight by keeping their abdominal muscles tight to stabilize the spinal column while in the air. In addition, they need to use their shoulders and their upper bodies to pull their weight off their bases underneath them. Flyers also need to learn to tuck their legs when loading into a stunting position in order to be completely stable off of the ground.<sup id=\"cite_ref-The_Basics_of_Cheerleading_Stunts_2-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-The_Basics_of_Cheerleading_Stunts-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> They also need to lock out their legs. If they don't stay tight, there is a greater risk of them becoming off of their center of balance and falling. It is also vital that the flyer knows how to properly dismount from the stunt. The flyer must stay tight and keep legs straight while the bases pop them, which is when the bases bend their knees and release the flyers feet from their hands. The flyer places their arms in a T formation and let the bases catch them in a piked position.<sup id=\"cite_ref-The_Basics_of_Cheerleading_Stunts_2-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-The_Basics_of_Cheerleading_Stunts-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> They must keep a steady focus on what they are doing. A strong core and good sense of balance are key qualities for a flyer to possess. In order to keep everyone as safe as possible while practicing stunts it is the groups best interest to have a <a href=\"/wiki/Coach_(sport)\" title=\"Coach (sport)\">coach</a> always present.\n</p><p>Flyers may be extremely flexible and have a good sense of balance. In order to do accomplish more advanced skills flyers need to be flexible so they can maintain their balance and position on one leg while pulling other tricks with the other leg.  Therefore, the more flexibility a flyer has the more successful their stunts will be. Flyers are typically the shorter and leaner people on the team, but other members can act as a flyer depending on their exceptional abilities.<sup id=\"cite_ref-usasf-glossary_3-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-usasf-glossary-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-aacca.org_4-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-aacca.org-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> The flyers must always look up and never down. Flyers tend to look out, whether it\u2019s into the crowd, or staring at a point on the wall but looking straight ahead will help keep them balanced. If flyers feel like they are going to fall because they cannot hold their balance, be sure to stay tight by keeping legs and arms tight next to the body so they don\u2019t hit or hurt the cheerleaders under the flyer holding them in the air.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Bases_and_Spotters\">Bases and Spotters</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=List_of_cheerleading_stunts&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Bases and Spotters\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Bases are the athletes that hold the flyer or top in the air during the stunt. They are responsible for keeping their flyer in the air, as well as making sure she is safe at all times. Bases are very strong and are usually assigned together based on height to create level platform for the flyer to perform an action. There are few recognized styles of stunting: <a href=\"/wiki/Coed\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Coed\">coed</a>, all-girl, and hybrid. There are no gender requirements for a base, both males and females can be bases.<sup id=\"cite_ref-usasf-glossary_3-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-usasf-glossary-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-aacca.org_4-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-aacca.org-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>  A base must be in direct contact of the floor where a stunting skill is being performed.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Bases have the responsibility of carrying out the stunt and keeping the flyer in the air.  The bottom person needs to complete every stunt to the exact way it\u2019s supposed to be performed in order for it to work every single time, especially when it needs to count the most in a sports game or a competition.  Their most important tool is their legs because they use it too extend cradles and basket tosses higher.  Both bases at all times, should be looking at their flyer in the air because it is their responsibility to hold them up and keep them safe.  If at any time the flyer is falling, both bases should actively try to stop the flyer from touching the floor so they don\u2019t get seriously injured. Spotters should stand behind the stunt with their hands together and ready to catch if the stunt for some reason must come down.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Main_Base\">Main Base</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=List_of_cheerleading_stunts&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Main Base\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>This base has the majority of the flyer's foot and the majority of her weight. The main base will be almost directly under the stunt until it is cradled or brought down. In a one leg extension stunt, the main base will lift the toe and heel of the foot to increase stability from moving forwards or backwards. With single base extensions the main base with grip onto the heel of the flyers foot having a nice and stable transition. The main base is the \"powerhouse\" of one legged stunts because she/he holds a majority of the weight but keeps their arms somewhat towards the center of the stunt to share the rest of the weight with the secondary base. The main base cups the flyers foot from toe to heel, creating a \"floor\" for the flyers foot and stability.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Secondary_Base\">Secondary Base</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=List_of_cheerleading_stunts&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Secondary Base\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>The term second base only applies when doing a one-legged stunt, this position can also be considered a \"side base.\" The second bases catches the flyer's foot during a prep or a \"sponge.\" The secondary bases help lift the flyer up into the air and support the flyer's foot. The hand position for the side base can vary depending on preference. The more common placement, which is also more reliable and sturdy, is to have one hand under the middle of the foot and the other hand pushing up on the wrist of the main base to lift from underneath.  The other approach is to have one hand under the middle of the foot and the other hand on top of the foot for stability. The problem with keeping the hand on top of the stunt is that the side base can tend to push down on the stunt instead of pulling up because they might not be as tall as the rest of the stunt to get their hand on top enough, which can create extra weight for the other cheerleaders on the bottom of the stunt. The second base's hand positioning functions to lift and to stabilize the flyer's foot from shifting from side to side.<sup id=\"cite_ref-aacca.org_4-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-aacca.org-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Back_Spot\">Back Spot</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=List_of_cheerleading_stunts&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Back Spot\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>The back spot is also called a \"third\".  They call each stunt. Example: \"Twist up, ready, 1,2\" OR \"Cradle, ready, 1,2\" This is the person actively stabilizing the stunt from the back. They help to position the flyer in the bases' hands upon entry. They support most of the weight of the flyer. They do so by using their hands to support the flyer's buttocks and ankles, and then push her up from her butt into the air. Once in the air, they will hold the flyer's ankles with both hands, pulling the ankles up to loosen the weight of the flyer for the bases and providing support. When the flyer cradles, they catch her under the arms to support the upper back and neck area. Since the center of gravity for a flyer is their hips, the back spot will always look at the hips while the stunt is happening. The back spot can determine the stability of the stunt by watching the flyer's hips. If the back spot follows the hips with her eyes, they can tell where the rest of the body will follow\u2014that is why they must make sure that the hips are centered between the shoulders and ankles.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Varsity_Brands,_Inc._6-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Varsity_Brands,_Inc.-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> If the flyer falls backwards, it is crucial for the back to attempt to catch the head and shoulders to prevent head/spinal injury. Due to the back's responsibilities, they are generally the tallest members of the team.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Front_Spot\">Front Spot</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=List_of_cheerleading_stunts&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Front Spot\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>This is the person standing in front of the stunt facing the back base preventing the flyer from falling forward. The front spot often provides extra support to wrists of the bases in higher stunts such as extensions. The front spot has somewhat of the job of the back spot. Though the front spot is there, a flyer should never fall forward, rather backwards. There is not always a front spot at the front  use front spots for basket tosses because it helps to throw straight upwards and gives the stunt more height. Front spots are typically the smaller people of the squad, who are not flexible enough to be a flyer, and are also not at the right height and strength to side or back. Front spots increase the stability of a stunt to make it perfect.<sup id=\"cite_ref-usasf-glossary_3-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-usasf-glossary-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-aacca.org_4-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-aacca.org-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Additional_Spot\">Additional Spot</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=List_of_cheerleading_stunts&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Additional Spot\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>This person is mostly unnecessary to the stunt group. They do not actually touch the stunt unless something goes wrong. The free standing spot can stand behind, in front, or beside the stunt. Eyes stay on the stunt at all times even though the stunt is not touched unless the flyer is falling. If spot must touch a stunt, points are deducted, but this only applies during a competition. Additional spots are typically used as a safety precaution. These spots are used mainly when a stunt group is trying a new stunt or position that they have not experimented with prior or when the group is new to each other. This reassures that if something were to go wrong with in the stunt that everyone would get out of the stunt safely, and that the flyer would safely return to the ground and land on her feet. Only recommended for unstable and first time stunts, and mandatory for competitions. For best results use four corner spotting.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Types_of_stunts\">Types of stunts</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=List_of_cheerleading_stunts&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: Types of stunts\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>This stunt uses both bases, a backspot, and a flyer.

The most common way that this is done is with the back spot to count, \u201cOne, two.\u201d The bases dip together on the \u201ctwo\u201d count and push through the legs and arms afterwards.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Varsity_Brands,_Inc._6-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Varsity_Brands,_Inc.-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> An extension prep is the same thing as a prep but now the bases\u2019 and back spots arms are fully extended straight up.  Keep in mind that for the flyer to be comfortable and stable in this stunt the bases should be spaced fairly close to together in order for the flyer\u2019s legs to be shoulder with apart. An elevator is a cheerleading stunt where both the bases start in the same position as a normal prep, but they are bent down more with their hands open like a book touching the ground. The flyer then steps into the bases hands, and the flyer slowly starts rising into the air, hence the name \"elevator.\"</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Cupie or an Awesome</dt>\n<dd>The Cupie is almost identical to the full extension except that the flyer's feet are together, in one hand of a single base or with one foot each in the hands of two bases. In a partner stunt the difference between a cupie and an awesome has to do with what the male is doing with his free hand. If the free hand is on the hip then it is a cupie, if the free hand is in a high V then it is an awesome.<sup id=\"cite_ref-USASF_Glossary_7-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-USASF_Glossary-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-usasf-glossary_3-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-usasf-glossary-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup></dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Extension or Full</dt>\n<dd>In an Extension,the flyer stands with each foot in the hands of a base while her arms are in an extended overhead position.

The flexibility of the flyer is tested in this stunt because the appearance and the impressiveness of this stunt depends on how far apart the bases can spread the flyer\u2019s legs to create a better visual appearance.  Along with that, flyer needs to keep their legs straight to help their bases and make sure their butt doesn\u2019t sag to not put too much pressure on the back spot.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Thigh stand</dt>\n<dd>A thigh stand is one of the simplest stunts. The bases kneel on one leg or are in a lunge position with their front knees bent in order to make it easier for the flyer to stand. The bases have their feet touching each other by the sides of their shoes. The back spot will hold the flyer at the waist. She will then jump onto the pocket of the bases' thighs.<sup id=\"cite_ref-usasf-glossary_3-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-usasf-glossary-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> The bases will then grasp their far hand on the toe of the flyer's foot and the closet arm around their leg and keep it close to their bodies so the flyer is secure within the stunt.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Shoulder stand</dt>\n<dd>In a shoulder stand, somebody stands on another person's shoulders. The base grabs their calves or ankles. To get out of this stunt, the base must pop the flyer forward catching them by their hips and slowly lowering the top to the floor.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Shoulder sit</dt>\n<dd>In a shoulder sit, the flyer sits on the base's shoulders and wraps her feet around the base's waist. There are many ways to enter into a shoulder sit, the most common is for the base to bend one knee while the flyer stands behind the base and places one foot on the base's bent leg and puts their hands on the base's shoulders to make it easier to pop into the stunt. Once the flyer and the base are ready, they both dip on the same count and the flyer will extend their arms and wrap their other leg that was on the ground around the base's shoulder, the base will focus on getting the other leg secure on their shoulder. To exit out of this stunt, the base must hold the flyers hands while dipping and popping them off the base's shoulders.  The flyer will land on the floor behind the base.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Leapin' Lora</dt>\n<dd>The backspot is in a \"rock\" position, the flyer then jumps on the back of the backspot and bounces into the bases' hands.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Steppers</dt>\n<dd>The main base brings the flyers left foot to belly button level, then the side bass brings her right leg to half, then the main base lifts the foot to full, and the side base lifts the right foot to full.

This stunt looks like the flyer is climbing up stairs and is also called 'Step Up'.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Liberty</dt>\n<dd>This is when both bases have grip on one of the flyer's feet. One bases has the normal open book grip and the other base has one hand placed under the foot in-between the other bases hands, the other hand is placed on top (also called hamburger grip). When the flyer goes up in the air, they are standing on one foot with the other foot bent placed by ones knee. This stunt is called a liberty because it is meant to look like lady liberty. The flyer must want to bring the free foot into the other knee so it looks more sophisticated and classy.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>tick-tock</dt>\n<dd>in this stunt the flyer is on one leg on both of the bases hands and jumps from one leg to the other.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Sponge</dt>\n<dd>the flyer is starting in an prep.

The flyer grabs her left foot with the right hand, and pulls her leg straight up beside her head. Then she pulls her left arm and upper torso through the hole the leg and arm made, holding it straight. This is another skill that take an enormous amount of flexibility because the flyer needs to hold her foot above her head parallel with her body. A bow and arrow is an advanced stunt that takes much practice and preparation before the flyer can try it.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Cobra&#160;</dt>\n<dd>Variation of a bow and arrow.

It is when the flyer is in a scorpion but the leg you are holding is completely straight and your arms are completely straight. Before starting this stunt, it is a good idea for the bases to stretch out their flyer's back and legs by holding her chest and one of her legs and pushing them together. By doing this, the flyer will be more prepared to pull the skill in the air.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Arabesque&#160;</dt>\n<dd>From a lib, the flyer points their leg out behind them and attempt to turn their hip socket out so when the leg is out straight, the side of the leg is facing the audience and their arms are in a \"T\" position. The flyer needs to arch her back too, so her torso is semi-straight up if not, too much of her weight will be tilted downward/too far forward and so the flyer along with the rest of the stunt will fall forward.  The stunt group (the cheerleaders on the bottom) are usually facing the side so the audience will see the side of the flyer's body.  But the flyer should always to remember to look at the crowd even though they are not facing straight.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Hitch&#160;</dt>\n<dd>A hitch is a variation of the prep or extension, usually in a pyramid. 3\u20135 people form a hitch pyramid. The two out-side flyers are usually on one girl's shoulders (in a shoulder sit). The two middle flyers are in an extension and give their left or right foot (depending which side) to the girl in the middle who holds the feet by her shoulders.

To enter into this stunt, the base must use proper toss technique; which is popping the flyer in the air follow through leaving the right arm extended while dropping your left arm to your chest. The top person\u2019s hips should be a couple of inches above your extended arms at the end of your toss. If the top\u2019s hips are any lower, you will catch the flyer with your arm bent and be forced to press the chair up. While the flyer is lowering down, spot for their seat and grab the left ankle for balance. Make sure to keep the right arm overhead pressed against your ear, for stability, and locked out you also want to keep the flyer\u2019s left leg in close to the body to help balance the stunt. When you catch the chair, absorb with your legs (not your arm) to take the pressure off of the landing. As a flyer, jump slightly back over your base, bend your right leg, and assume a \u201cchair\u201d position. In the chair, your right leg should be resting on the base\u2019s right forearm, your shoulders are directly over your hips, and your left leg should be positioned slightly in front of your hip.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Varsity_Brand,_Inc._12-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Varsity_Brand,_Inc.-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> The flyer stunts with her arms and free leg, usually by putting her foot in a 90-degree angle making a liberty pose and her arms in a high V position.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Pretty Girl</dt>\n<dd>When the bases put the flyer in an extended position or half, and when the flyer gets thrown into the air, the flyer puts her hand behind her head and lifts her leg into the lib position while in the air.

At the peak of the toss, the flyer will kick their left leg up while their arms make an \u201cL-like\u201d motion (left arm in a punch, right arm in candlesticks), she will spin either once or twice by wrapping her leg over and looking the way she is spinning with her head, depending on the basket.  The bases and back spot wait with arms extended to catch the top girl in the cradle. They remain in the same position the entire time. After executing the body position, the flyer will snap their legs back together for the cradle. The bases will begin to slow the flyer into the cradle as soon as they make contact with her body. As they catch, they will absorb with their legs to ease the pressure of gravity coming down on them. Like a regular cradle, the flyer pikes her body, keeping her shoulders up and catching herself on her bases\u2019 shoulders.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Varsity_Brands,_Inc._6-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Varsity_Brands,_Inc.-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup></dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Straight ride basket&#160;</dt>\n<dd>The flyer is thrown from an extension where she fully extends her arms by her ears, using her shoulders to set up.
