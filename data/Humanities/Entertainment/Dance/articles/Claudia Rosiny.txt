Claudia Rosiny (born February 15, 1960 in Bad Godesberg) is a German-Swiss academic in Dance and Media studies, a festival director and cultural manager. She became internationally known as an expert on video dance. Having served as a co-director of the Berne Dance Days (Berner Tanztage) for many years, she teaches at the University of Bern and at the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts and is in charge of Dance and Theatre at the Federal Office for Culture, Berne.  Claudia Rosiny grew up the eldest of six siblings in the Herler Mühle (de), an old water mill in Cologne-Buchheim. Her father, Nikolaus Rosiny (de) (born July 19, 1926 in Mülheim an der Ruhr, Germany, died March 16, 2011 in Cologne) was an architect, her mother Johanna Rosiny née Riedel (born June 4, 1936 in Prague), a psychotherapist for children and adolescents. After completing her training as a gymnastics teacher, Rosiny studied Theatre, Film and Television, German and Education at the University of Cologne  (1983–1989). For three semesters, she also attended the Play-Music-Dance (Spiel-Musik-Tanz) course as a guest student at the German Sport University Cologne(Deutsche Sporthochschule Köln). In 1987/88 she did one semester of Theatre Studies at the University of Amsterdam. In 1997, she did a PhD with her dissertation being on Video Dance at the Institute of Theatre Studies at the University of Berne.  Since her studies Claudia Rosiny has devoted herself to her specialist fields of Video Dance and Intermediality in Dance: "Inter- and transdisciplinary cultural studies are needed in an art context of convergence, in which the disciplines come together, connect and enable new experiences of perception. (...) If time travel was possible, I would like to talk to the pioneers of film and dance, like Georges Méliès or Loïe Fuller, and ask them what, back then, fascinated them most in the interplay of movement of dance and film."  She is married to Reto Clavadetscher (born 1961), they have a daughter and live in Bern. This festival of contemporary dance was established in 1987 by Reto Clavadetscher and co-directed by Claudia Rosiny from 1991 to 2007. Highlights of the Berne Dance Days include the themed festivals  Danseimage (1996, re. dance and film) and Kunststückkörper (1997, re. dance and diverse body forms, including disabilities), and guest performances by renowned dance artists such as Maguy Marin (de), Wim Vandekeybus, Sasha Waltz, Meg Stuart and many others. The Berne Dance Days are documented on several media platforms: Since its foundation in 1998, the Kornhausforum  has been a venue for design and social politics. The concept for its occupancy, demonstrating a pronounced bias towards culture, was determined via a referendum of the Bernese people. Over ten years (1998–2007) – first as a co-director (with Peter Eichenberger), then, from 2006 onwards, solely in charge – Claudia Rosiny steered its development as a cultural centre focusing on architecture, design, photography, video, new media and socio-political issues. In addition to around 300 events per year, more than 100 exhibitions were held during this time, including: From 2009 to 2012, Rosiny worked as a specialist consultant on modern dance for the Swiss Dance Archive (Schweizer Tanzarchiv) in Zurich, where she co-ordinated lecture programmes, acquired, amongst others, the Nachlass (estate) of Sigurd Leeder in 2011, oversaw a video project on early contemporary dance in Western Switzerland and, until the end of 2010, project-managed the fusion  of the Archives suisses de la danse in Lausanne with the mediathektanz.ch in Zurich into the Swiss Dance Archive (Schweizer Tanzarchiv/Collection suisse de la danse) with branches in Zürich and Lausanne. It has existed in this new form since January 1, 2011. As a lecturer, Rosiny  is strongly committed to integrating dance practice, dance studies and film. From 1994 to 2005, she led seminars on Video Dance and Contemporary Dance at the Institute for Theatre Studies at the University of Berne, and from 2006 to 2011 proseminars on intermediality, postmodernism, dance, theatre and performance at the Institute for Media Studies at the University of Basel. From 2002 to 2015, she was a member of the programme management team and a lecturer on the continuing education course TanzKultur (designed for students in employment) at the University of Bern. Since 2016, she has been working there in the same capacity at the Institute for Theatre Studies on the newly introduced Master of Advanced Studies in Dance/Performing Arts course: "This unique Continuing Education Study Programme, with its interdisciplinary design and international network, will reflect the current state of research."
