Dance permit is a permit required for dancing. Since the 1930s a dance permit ("danstillstånd") is required for public dance events in Sweden per the law of order (2 kap. 4 § ordningslagen 1993:1617). The Riksdag voted unanimously to abolish the requirement for a dance permit in 2016  but the law still exists and is enforced.
