The thattai is an Indian percussion instrument, belonging to the idiophone instruments family. It consists in a cane tube, in which the end has three reeds (two of them free) that produce a percussive sound when the shaft is shaken with one hand. Thattai is used as a toy or as rhythmic accompaniment instrument.
