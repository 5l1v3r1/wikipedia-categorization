Ohbot is a programmable robotic head which was created in the UK in 2015 by Mat Walker and Dan Warner. Ohbot encourages children to experiment with making, computer programming and interacting with their environment through technology. Ohbot uses a drag and drop block programming language similar to the Scratch (programming language) to make it move, speak and sense.
