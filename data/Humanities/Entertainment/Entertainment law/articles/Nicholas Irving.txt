Nicholas Irving  is a former special operations Direct action (military) sniper in the 3rd Ranger Battalion for the U.S. Military.  He is now working as a reality TV personality. Irving was born in Fort Meade, Maryland on the US Army post Fort George G. Meade growing up the son of two enlisted soldiers.  He wasn’t a great student — the only A he ever got was in junior ROTC — and his discipline needed some work.  In 2012, Irving wrote and published Team Reaper: 33 Kills...4 months.  In 2015, he wrote and published with Gary Brozek a book about his time in the military fighting the War on Terrorism called The Reaper: Autobiography of One of the Deadliest Special Ops Snipers.   On February 2, 2015, The Weinstein Company acquired the television rights to make a miniseries out of the autobiography.  On March 5, 2015, NBC picked up the miniseries from Weinstein.   In late 2017 Irving revealed in a podcast that the miniseries has been scrapped, but a movie based on the book was in preproduction.  In May 2018 he published a book called Reaper: Ghost Target.  Irving joined the U.S. Military. Failing a colorblindness test ended the young man’s hopes for joining the SEALs, but Irving took to life as a Ranger. Before serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, he left his wife at Fort Benning. Irving took an SR-25 rifle with him, calling it Dirty Diana.   Fellow Rangers nicknamed Irving "The Reaper" because of his proficiency for killing.  After serving his country, he decided to work in television. Irving first served as legal and business affairs associate in 911: The Bronx (TV series documentary 2008), The IT Crowd (2008–10), and Never Mind the Buzzcocks (2008–11). Irving served as production lawyer on PhoneShop (2009–10). He next served as legal and business affairs associate on The Rob Brydon Show (2010), QI Genesis (TV Movie documentary 2011), and QI (2009–13). In 2016, Irving was one of four military leaders to serve as coaches on the reality show American Grit with John Cena.    Starting in 2017, Irving appeared in videos for the popular YouTube channel "Demolition Ranch" and "Off the Ranch" with Matt Carriker.  He also served as an on-set advisor for Doug Liman's 2017 sniper film The Wall. Sgt. Irving married Jessica Irving in 2007.
