Triviatown - It's the World's Biggest Trivia Contest is a 2006 documentary directed by Patrick Cady and Brit McAdams about the world's largest trivia contest in Stevens Point, Wisconsin. For the past 35 years 12,000 people on 430 teams have come to Stevens Point for the World's Largest Trivia Contest. Clustered together in basements, garages, and converted storefronts for 54 straight hours, old friends compete against old enemies, husbands battle wives, and grandparents wake up kids at 4 AM to find out where SpongeBob SquarePants lives.
