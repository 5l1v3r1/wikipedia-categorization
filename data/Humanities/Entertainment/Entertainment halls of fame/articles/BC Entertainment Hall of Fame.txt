  The BC Entertainment Hall of Fame in Vancouver was founded on 24 July 1992 to honour British Columbians that have made outstanding contributions to the entertainment industry.   Star Walk inductees are featured with a plaque on the Walk of Fame on Granville Street and in a Starwall gallery in the Orpheum.   Individuals and organizations can be nominated and inducted. The City of Vancouver provides guided tours of the Orpheum and BC Entertainment Hall of Fame Starwall to which the proceeds go back into the BC Entertainment Hall of Fame fund.  The selection process can take several years from the time the nomination to when its given.  Dorothy Davies was one of the first Star Walk inductees.
