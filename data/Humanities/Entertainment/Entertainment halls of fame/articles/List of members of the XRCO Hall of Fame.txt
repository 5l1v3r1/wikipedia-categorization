The XRCO Hall of Fame lists some of the most notable adult entertainment works and workers. The list is managed by X-Rated Critics Organization and inducted annually during the XRCO Awards. The first XRCO Awards were presented in Hollywood on February 14, 1985.  Inductees must have been industry members for at least ten years.  Members are listed in the order that they were inducted, with the year they were inducted, if known: "This unique special-achievement award is given periodically by the XRCO to acknowledge companies or individuals who have gone the extra distance for the adult-film industry."
