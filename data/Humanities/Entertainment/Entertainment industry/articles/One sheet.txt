In the entertainment industry, a one-sheet or one sheet is a single document that summarizes a product for publicity and sales. A one sheet is a specific size (typically 27 by 41 inches (69 cm × 104 cm) before 1985; 27 by 40 inches (69 cm × 102 cm) after 1985) of film poster advertising. Multiple one-sheets are used to assemble larger advertisements, which are referred to by their sheet count, including 24-sheet  billboards, and 30-sheet billboards. The term is also used as synonym for the poster artwork and the film poster itself.  Since a one-sheet is used in the official advertising for films, they are prized by both collectors of memorabilia for specific films and of film posters themselves. Film posters sold in general retail are in poster size, 24 by 36 inches (61 cm × 91 cm). Prior to 1985, the majority of film posters sent to cinemas were folded before mailing and, on rare occasions, they were instead rolled and shipped in tubes. While today there are several ways to eliminate these fold lines, many purists prefer film posters in their used condition. In music publicity and distribution, a one-sheet is exactly what the name implies:  One sheet of paper, on which information is provided about the musician and/or a specific release which is being distributed.  One-sheets often accompany a record or CD when it is being shipped to radio stations and music publications (i.e., magazines, Web-based forums, etc.)  A one-sheet is sometimes also referred to as a press sheet or a promo sheet. Depending on the purpose it serves, a one-sheet will often contain a variety of information about its subject. Often comprising both images and text, one-sheets typically serve as a way to introduce the unfamiliar reader to a particular artist.  The name of the artist (and perhaps the title of the release) will appear prominently. Some common elements found on a one-sheet can include:
