The Dish is a satirical television series that aired on the Style Network in the United States. The show (first airing August 16, 2008), hosted by Danielle Fishel,  skewers the latest in pop culture (television, movies, magazines, celebrities, etc.) in similar fashion to sister network E! Entertainment Television's series The Soup. The show also aired on International E! channels alongside The Soup. The show's final episode aired March 20, 2011, two months after the merger of NBCUniversal and Comcast was completed. The merger had brought former competitors Bravo and Oxygen under common NBCUniversal ownership with Style, nullifying much of the video material available to The Dish, as many Bravo and Oxygen programs under NBC's ownership apart from Style had been used for satirical purposes for the show. As with The Soup, the show primarily consists of Fishel providing humorous commentary on content (such as clips of television programs), arranged in themed segments. Unlike The Soup however, the show places more emphasis on fashion and celebrity culture. A running gag throughout the series was Fishel's being typecast and being recognized solely for her most famous role as Topanga Lawrence from Boy Meets World.
