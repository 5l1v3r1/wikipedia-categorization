The Fabulous Life Of... is a VH1 television series detailing the places, things, and services various celebrities enjoy.  It first aired in 2003, with a special about Britney Spears. The show is tightly based on the television show Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous. The show is narrated by Christopher Flockton.  In 2005, The Fabulous Life of the Women of Desperate Housewives was broadcast due to the success of ABC's Desperate Housewives. The Fabulous Life Presents: Really Rich Real Estate is a spin-off focusing on the Westside Estate Agency and their wealthy celebrity clients. Frankie Muniz and Inge Bongo were featured in the first episode which premiered in November 2006. Unlike The Fabulous Life of..., which focuses on the celebrities themselves, this series focuses on a business which caters to celebrities and has a different tone and style. The houses are featured because someone wants to buy or sell them with Westside.
