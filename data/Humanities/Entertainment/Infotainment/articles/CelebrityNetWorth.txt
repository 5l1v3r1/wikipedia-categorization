Celebrity Net Worth is a website which reports estimates of the total assets and financial activities of celebrities. It is operated by the company Corte Lodato LLC, founded by CEO Brian Warner in 2008.   Celebrity Net Worth creates web pages that list a celebrity's name, biography, and estimates of net worth and salary. The site calculates net worth by "applying a proprietary algorithm" based on publicly available information and using financial analysts to review such results.  Warner has said of their estimates that "If we end up too far off, there is always some kind of backlash. There have been a handful cases when we’ve been proved to be off, and we’ve corrected it."  The site provide news articles on financial transactions of celebrities such as the purchase of a home or lawsuits.  Celebrity Net Worth creates lists ranking wealthy individuals based upon their wealth. In 2012 the company compiled a list of the 25 richest people in history, adjusted for inflation, naming King Mansa Musa of the Mali Empire at the top of the list.     That same year, it created a list of the world’s richest DJs,  and a survey which named Ringo Starr as the world’s richest drummer.  In 2014, Google requested permission from Warner to include Celebrity Net Worth's data in its Knowledge Graph. Warner declined. However, in February 2016, Google began using information from its search index of Celebrity Net Worth to display featured snippets with net worths at the top of their search result pages for relevant queries. The featured snippets were positioned above the search results, including results for Celebrity Net Worth. As a result, Celebrity Net Worth's web traffic declined by 65 percent from January 2016 to January 2017.
