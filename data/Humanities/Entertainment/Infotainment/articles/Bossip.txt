Bossip is an online gossip and entertainment magazine with a focus on African American celebrities. The site is owned by Moguldom Media Group. Bossip is based in Atlanta, Georgia. Bossip has interviewed celebrities such as Kanye West, Janet Jackson, Sanaa Lathan, Russell Simmons and Damon Dash. Another exclusive interview Bossip had done is with Kim Kardashian, talking about her life, career, relationships and the infamous sex tape with R&B singer and younger brother of Brandy, Ray J.  In October, 2006, Bossip published its first annual Style Awards with Diddy getting the title as best dressed African-American celebrity and Serena Williams as worst dressed.  Two months later in December, Bossip published a new "award" for most annoying celebrity of 2006 with R&B/Pop singer and actress Beyonc√© Knowles as 1st position, Actor Taye Diggs at 10th position and rapper Kanye West with an honorable mention.  In December 2015, rapper Nicki Minaj accused Bossip of "ignorance" for a series of sexist tweets, including one which stated that she had only become famous because of her physical attributes.  After Donald Trump's victory in the 2016 presidential election, Bossip ran a series of articles mocking the appearance of his campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, who was the first woman to run a successful presidential campaign. This included referring to her as a "blonde bimbo", "a piece of lying shit",  a "bruised fruit",  and "potato-salad faced".  The site also compiled a gallery of women supposedly more attractive than her,  and published a photoshopped image implying that she performed sex acts on Trump.  Bossip's focus on Conway was criticised as sexist by both feminist and conservative sources.
