Up and Vanished is an investigative journalism podcast hosted by Payne Lindsey. The series takes an in-depth look into the cases of people who have gone missing. The show is produced by Tenderfoot TV. The series explores cases of people who went missing or have disappeared in order to discover what happened to them and their whereabouts. The first season dealt with the disappearance of Tara Grinstead,  a beauty queen and school teacher who disappeared in Ocilla, Georgia.  Season 2 aired in August 2018 focusing on the disappearance of Kristal Reisinger in Crestone, Colorado. In 2016, documentary filmmaker Payne Lindsey of Tenderfoot TV studios began researching the Tara Grinstead cold case as a possibility for a new film.  Lindsey became aware of Tara Grinstead's case because of its reputation as the largest case file in Georgia state history, but he also soon discovered that his grandmother's friend was one of the last people to see Tara alive.  Inspired by the popular NPR podcast Serial, Lindsey recorded his research in a podcast style format detailing the specifics of the case, as well as interviews with key witnesses. The podcast, Up and Vanished,  premiered on Apple Podcasts and the show's website, upandvanished.com, on August 7, 2016.  Soon after the podcast's release it made the top charts and began receiving attention and notoriety within the small Ocilla, Georgia community.  The podcast is credited with reigniting the discussion on the case after it sat dormant for twelve years. In the statement by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation announcing the arrest of Ryan Alexander Duke in connection to the murder, the GBI's spokesperson thanked the media for keeping the public interested in the case.  A television show based on the podcast is in development with Oxygen set to premier sometime in the future.
