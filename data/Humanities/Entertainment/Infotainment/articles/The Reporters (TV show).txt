The Reporters is an American newsmagazine television program that aired on FOX Television during the 1988–89 and 1989–90 seasons. The Reporters was structured much in the style of the syndicated program A Current Affair, except that there was no regular "host" role. As A Current Affair was produced for syndication by Fox, there was a considerable overlap in subject matter and some reporters even appeared on both programs. The premiere episode asked if Mike Tyson (whose marriage to Robin Givens was tabloid fodder at the time) was really gay. Some segments from the program have since been seen in the present day in a historical context on Fox News Channel as part of their compilation series, From the Fox Files.
