And Penina Mlama, referring to the enterprise as Popular Theatre, describes its aims briefly as follows: \u2026it aims to make the people not only aware of but also active participants in the development process by expressing their viewpoints and acting to better their conditions. Popular theatre is intended to empower the common man with a critical consciousness crucial to the struggle against the forces responsible for his poverty. (1991:67)\n</p><p>Theatre for Development can be a kind of <a href=\"/wiki/Participatory_theatre\" title=\"Participatory theatre\">participatory theatre</a>, that encourages <a href=\"/wiki/Improvisation\" title=\"Improvisation\">improvisation</a> and audience members to take roles in the performance, or can be fully scripted and staged, with the audience observing. Many TfD productions are a mix of the two. \"Theatre of the Oppressed\" (TO), a technique created by <a href=\"/wiki/Augusto_Boal\" title=\"Augusto Boal\">Augusto Boal</a> is a form of community-based theatre.\n</p><p>Hundreds, if not thousands, of organizations and initiatives have used theatre as a development tool: for education or propaganda, as therapy, as a participatory tool, or as an exploratory tool in development. An account of an early use of TfD is the thesis <i>Theater as a Means of Moral Education and Socialization in the Development of <a href=\"/wiki/Nauvoo,_Illinois\" title=\"Nauvoo, Illinois\">Nauvoo</a>, Illinois, 1839-1845</i>, which recounts how theater was used to promote ideological and civil development in a religious community in the US (Hurd 2004).\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Participatory_performances\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Participatory performances</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Forum_theatre\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Forum theatre</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Non-participative_&#39;Theatre_for_Development&#39;_performances\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Non-participative 'Theatre for Development' performances</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Street_theatre\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Street theatre</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#Sources\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Sources</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Participatory_performances\">Participatory performances</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Theatre_for_development&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Participatory performances\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In usual <a href=\"/wiki/Performances\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Performances\">performances</a> there are actors on stage and spectators who watch the play. With \u2018usual plays\u2019 it is meant the Eurocentric way that was long seen as the only \u2018right\u2019 way to do theatre all over the world, especially by the former European rulers of colonized countries. In e.g. African or Asian countries different forms of theatre were and still are very common in the sense of bringing information to the people in an oral way. Thus, different theatre traditions developed worldwide and re-lived in colonized countries after independence, whilst in rural areas they were even common during colonization. By now these times are over, and development communication got a very important topic, thus it seems perfect to make up still living traditions through participative theatre methods.\nFirst of all it is very important for actors and organisers of the performance or TfD-project to get to know the society and the problems people face. Therefore, the play that is going to be performed and worked with has to be developed with local people, who know <a href=\"/wiki/Cultural_behavior\" title=\"Cultural behavior\">cultural behaviors</a> and social problems of the society. Moreover, it is very helpful to have local authority persons and opinion leaders in the team of a TfD-project, whom the regional society listens to and trusts. In this way it is even possible to take advantage of the knowledge that locals have about best dates for performances or even to advertise for the ongoing TfD-performance.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Forum_theatre\">Forum theatre</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Theatre_for_development&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Forum theatre\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In TfD programs the EEE BAYE performance is mostly played on a community (or gathering) place, but randomly on a stage. In forum theatre the scene acted out shows one ore even more problems the audience faces on their daily routine. Afterwards <a href=\"/wiki/Theatre_of_the_Oppressed\" title=\"Theatre of the Oppressed\">forum theatre</a> is explained to the audience by another person of the team and the scene will be shown again. This second and even third, fourth, fifth etc. time, one person after another from the audience can stop the play wherever she or he think it\u2019s suitable and come into the scene. Spectators become so called \"spect-actors\", whereas the replaced actor steps back. Through being part of the scene participating people dive into the situation performed, what makes the whole topic feel more real for the person who came in to change the situation. Thus, it is an alternative way of problem solving, where creativity is asked for and different approaches are tried. Forum theatre functions as \u2018a rehearsal for reality\u2019, like Augusto Boal used to call it.\nYou can obtain more information on Augusto Boal and his techniques of The Theatre of the Oppressed at the Website of the <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.ccdc.in\">Centre for Community Dialogue and Change</a>(CCDC).

Especially in oppressive regimes it is not possible to perform political plays, as they will be prohibited from the very beginning on or the revolutionists become prisoners. A lot of <a href=\"/wiki/Creativity\" title=\"Creativity\">creativity</a> is asked for writing and performing a politically critical play that is a very important feature of TfD methods. Besides political issues common topics are <a href=\"/wiki/Nonformal_learning\" title=\"Nonformal learning\">non-formal education</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Hygiene\" title=\"Hygiene\">hygiene</a>, disposal of sewage, environment, <a href=\"/wiki/Women%27s_rights\" title=\"Women&#39;s rights\">women's rights</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Child_abuse\" title=\"Child abuse\">child abuse</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Prostitution\" title=\"Prostitution\">prostitution</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Street_children\" title=\"Street children\">street children</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Health_education\" title=\"Health education\">health education</a>, HIV/<a href=\"/wiki/AIDS\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"AIDS\">AIDS</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Literacy\" title=\"Literacy\">literacy</a> etc.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Street_theatre\"><a href=\"/wiki/Street_theatre\" title=\"Street theatre\">Street theatre</a></span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Theatre_for_development&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Street theatre\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Methods like e.g. '<a href=\"/wiki/Invisible_theatre\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Invisible theatre\">invisible theatre</a>' or '<a href=\"/wiki/Theatre_of_the_Oppressed\" title=\"Theatre of the Oppressed\">image theatre</a>' can be acted in the streets, seen by people passing by. 'Invisible theatre' seems like a real situation to the audience, which mainly functions as a thought-provoking impulse to the people who observe the situation.\nEvery kind of TfD-programme trusts in the strength of the word of mouth via people who face the situation, are part of a project or watch a critical play. 'Invisible theatre' in the streets reaches people who wouldn't attend a workshop or watch a play, thus the coverage of addressed people can be even higher and <a href=\"/wiki/Social_change\" title=\"Social change\">social change</a> is another step closer.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Theatre_for_development&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><cite class=\"citation book\">Kabaso, Sydney (2013). <i>Theater for Development in Zambia</i>.
