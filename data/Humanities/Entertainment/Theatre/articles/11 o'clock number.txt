11 o'clock number is a theatre term for a big, show-stopping song that occurs late in the second act of a two-act musical, in which a major character, often the protagonist, comes to an important realization. Examples include "So Long Dearie" from Hello, Dolly!, "Rose's Turn" from Gypsy, and "Work the Wound" from Passing Strange.  It was so named because in the days when musical performances would start at 8:30 pm, this song would occur around 11:00 pm.  Among the theatre community, there is some debate as to the characteristics of an 11 o'clock number. It often signifies a moment of revelation or change in heart of a lead character, although there are exceptions to this.  The 11 o'clock number is also differentiated from the finale in that it is not the final number in the show, but even this is not considered a requirement by some commenters.  Other notable 11 o'clock numbers include "Sit Down, You're Rockin' the Boat" from Guys and Dolls , "Memory" from Cats , "Brotherhood of Man" from How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying , "Gimme Gimme" from Thoroughly Modern Millie , "Another National Anthem" from Assassins , "The American Dream" from Miss Saigon, "I'm Here" from The Color Purple , and "Always Starting Over" from If/Then.
