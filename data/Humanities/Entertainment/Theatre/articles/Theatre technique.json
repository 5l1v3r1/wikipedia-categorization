In earlier centuries it was the author, an actor-manager, or a leading actor with whom the responsibilities of staging a drama were invested.\n</p><p>The director produces the play in the way he envisages how it ought to be seen as he interprets what the playwright intended within the drama; he takes care of the effectiveness of the rehearsals of the actors; and coordinates the work of designers and technicians in the production. \n</p><p>However, the playwright\u2019s work is still reflected in the director\u2019s <a href=\"/wiki/Prompter_(theatre)\" title=\"Prompter (theatre)\">prompt copy</a>, a separate form of stage instructions worked out in detail by the director, in which each actor is given details as to what is happening onstage, where exactly he has to be in relation to the back, front, left, or right of the stage, and what he is to do at any one time during the play.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Stage_management_and_stagecraft\">Stage management and stagecraft</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Theatre_technique&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Stage management and stagecraft\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Stage_manager\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Stage manager\">stage manager</a> has to work with the director, and ascertain whether both the director\u2019s objectives and the perceptions of the <a href=\"/wiki/Stage_designer\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Stage designer\">stage designers</a> are compatible and realistic. They are usually the link between the director and the rest of the company, and are responsible for the director\u2019s visions being passed down to each <a href=\"/wiki/Actor\" title=\"Actor\">actor</a> and member of the <a href=\"/wiki/Running_crew\" title=\"Running crew\">running crew</a>.

For example, the stage alone cannot be expected to provide wide and distant <a href=\"/wiki/Panorama\" title=\"Panorama\">vistas</a>, or vast spaces where armies gather or huge masses of people congregate. Natural phenomena such as <a href=\"/wiki/Thunderstorm\" title=\"Thunderstorm\">thunderstorms</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Wind\" title=\"Wind\">winds</a>, that are often part of the drama, cannot be recreated in their original form. Furthermore, because of the distance involved, it is difficult for actors to portray the feelings, tensions and passions of their characters to the <a href=\"/wiki/Audience\" title=\"Audience\">audience</a> with much distinctiveness.\n</p><p>It is for these reasons that special technologies and techniques have been developed from classical times onward to supplement and augment the effects that are to be realised. Technical specialists help to implement these techniques by providing expertise in various areas of the production. The stage manager and their team must ultimately draw all these separate techniques together to create an effective and successful stage production.\n</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Theatrical_scenery\" title=\"Theatrical scenery\">Sets and sceneries</a> have to be designed and created in the <a href=\"/wiki/Workshop\" title=\"Workshop\">workshop</a>.

Time merely entered into his recommendations as a hint as to the limits of the <a href=\"/wiki/Attention\" title=\"Attention\">attention</a> span the audience could be expected to have. The unity of place, that of the confinement of the action in a play to one locality only, was not mentioned at all.<br />The effect of the three unities on French drama during this period was that their presentation became very restrictive, and it was only when later dramatists began to avoid mentioning specific times and places that the presentation of plays became more creative again.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Theatre_presentation\">Theatre presentation</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Theatre_technique&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Theatre presentation\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Some <a href=\"/wiki/Dramatist\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Dramatist\">dramatists</a> and dramaturgists try to achieve particular effects that are not normally sought in a theatre presentation.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Defamiliarization_effect_.28Verfremdungseffekt.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Defamiliarization_effect_(Verfremdungseffekt)\">Defamiliarization effect (Verfremdungseffekt)</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Theatre_technique&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Defamiliarization effect (Verfremdungseffekt)\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/Bertolt_Brecht\" title=\"Bertolt Brecht\">Bertolt Brecht</a> coined the term \"defamiliarization effect\" (sometimes called \"estrangement effect\" or \"alienation effect\"; German <i><a href=\"/wiki/Verfremdungseffekt\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Verfremdungseffekt\">Verfremdungseffekt</a></i>) for an approach to theater that focused on the central ideas and decisions in the play, and discouraged involving the audience in an illusory world and in the emotions of the characters.
