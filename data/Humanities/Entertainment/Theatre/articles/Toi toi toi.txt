 "Toi toi toi" (English:  /ˈtɔɪ ˈtɔɪ ˈtɔɪ/)  is an expression used in the performing arts to wish an artist success in an imminent performance. It is similar to "break a leg" and reflects a superstition that wishing someone "good luck" is in fact bad luck.    Toi toi toi was an idiom used to ward off a spell or hex, often accompanied by knocking on wood or spitting. The origin is a threefold warning of the devil (Teufel, pr. toi-fell) in German dialect: No’ kommt mer in’s Teu-Teu-Teufelskuchen bey ihm. Now we come into the De-De-Devil's Kitchen! Also from Rotwelsch tof and from Yiddish tov ("good", derived from the Hebrew טוב and with phonetic similarities to the Old German tiuvel "Devil.")  A separate explanation sees "toi toi toi" as the onomatopoeic rendition of spitting three times, a common practice in many parts of the world to ward off evil spirits. Saliva traditionally had demon-banishing powers. An alternate operatic good luck charm, originating from Italy, is the phrase In bocca al lupo! ("In the mouth of the wolf") with the response Crepi! or Crepi il lupo!  ("May it [the wolf] die!"). Amongst actors "Break a leg" is the usual phrase, while for professional dancers the traditional saying is merde (from the French "shit"). In Spanish, the phrase is mucha mierda, or "lots of shit".
