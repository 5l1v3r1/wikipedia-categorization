A cerulean sky, often intricately dotted with accurately depicted starry skies with wispy floating clouds produced by a projector replaced the ornate domes of traditional theatre design. Rather than crystal chandeliers and gilt ornamentation there were arches, trellises, balconies and statuary to evoke a sense of the outdoors. Other ornamentation included trees, palms and vines and even taxidermy birds. As the stars twinkled above, creating in the audience a sense of infinite space, when the entertainment was about to begin the lighting effects created an illusion of the setting sun, as colors changed from yellow to red to mauve. The atmospheric theatre design made the patron an active, comfortable resident of an imaginary time and place, not a passive, aloof occupant of an oppressive formal space.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The extravagantly designed theaters of the early twentieth century were expensive to build. These classically designed theaters required an elaborate auditorium ceiling, usually with one or more grand chandeliers. An atmospheric theater only required a simple, smooth dome with low-wattage lights to simulate twinkling stars. This is not to say atmospheric theaters were always simple in design. The side walls of the theaters often featured very complex elements that created a fantasy outdoor setting like being in a village, garden, or on the grounds of a grand palace.\n</p><p>The most successful promoter of the style was <a href=\"/wiki/John_Eberson\" title=\"John Eberson\">John Eberson</a>.

Constructed in 1930, the interior of the auditorium was designed to resemble a walled medieval courtyard surrounded by a forest.

It opened on Friday, August 15, 1930 with the film \"Queen High\" starring Charles Ruggles and Ginger Rogers.\n</p>\n<ul><li><b>Le Grand Rex</b> (<a href=\"/wiki/Paris\" title=\"Paris\">Paris</a>, France)</li></ul>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/Le_Grand_Rex\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Le Grand Rex\">Le Grand Rex</a> is the largest cinema, theater and music venue in Paris, with 2,800 seats.

The Lido is the world's longest continuously operating atmospheric theatre (87 years straight as of 2016). The interior features an outdoor Mediterranean courtyard motif. It was built to seat 600 people but the current configuration allows for 350. The Lido has avoided major renovations, remaining close to its original design. A rare survivor in its class, one of the few cinemas to stay in the same family for four generations, it remains owned by the Rivalin family.<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<ul><li><b>Rialto Cinema</b> (<a href=\"/wiki/Dunedin\" title=\"Dunedin\">Dunedin</a>, New Zealand).</li></ul>\n<p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Rialto_Cinema,_Dunedin\" title=\"Rialto Cinema, Dunedin\">Rialto Cinema</a> originally seated 2,000.

It used the shell of a former ball court, whose space was sufficient for a big movie theatre. It was the only one built ever in Mexico in Chinese style, but unlike the Grauman\u2019s Chinese, the interior was of the atmospheric type. In 1945 it was listed as having 4,000 seats in two levels, orchestra and balcony. It featured a fairly big stage, enough so to hold a symphony orchestra, and indeed was sometimes used as a music theater. Celibidache once directed the National Symphony Orchestra here, as an alternate theater to Bellas Artes, itself the home theater of said orchestra. The inevitable comparation with Grauman\u2019s Chinese stands only as original inspiration goes, because both buildings are very different. The Palacio Chino has a big, traditional flat facade, right in front of Iturbide street. The many windows of this facade are adorned as small pagodas, and there is a big, ornate marquee. The vestibule was spacious and full of Chinese decorations, even the ticket boots were rendered as pagodas. The auditorium was of the atmospheric type, with pagodas, temples and gold Buddha statues amid gardens. The ceiling was vault-like, not flat but very arched, and of course was painted deep blue. The screen was protected by a heavy black curtain, with Chinese motifs painted upon. The screen arch was very heavily decorated, with dragons appearing here and there.\n</p>\n<ul><li><b><a href=\"/wiki/Campbeltown_Picture_House\" title=\"Campbeltown Picture House\">Campbeltown Picture House</a></b> (Campbeltown, Scotland)</li></ul>\n<p>Purpose-built cinema constructed in 1903.
