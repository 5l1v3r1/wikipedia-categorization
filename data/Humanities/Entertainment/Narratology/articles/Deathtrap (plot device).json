Through the decades, <a href=\"/wiki/Comic_book\" title=\"Comic book\">comic book</a> writers have responded to these complaints by devising ways in which the deathtraps have served other purposes.\n</p><p>For instance, one <i><a href=\"/wiki/Legion_of_Super-Heroes\" title=\"Legion of Super-Heroes\">Legion of Super-Heroes</a></i> story by <a href=\"/wiki/Jim_Shooter\" title=\"Jim Shooter\">Jim Shooter</a> had a team of Legionnaires put into a variety of deathtraps and the villains <i>wanted</i> the heroes to successfully escape. This was because the real purpose of the deathtraps was to have the Legionnaires use a great deal of energy doing so, which the villains then harnessed for their own benefit. Other stories have had villains use deathtraps as a means of testing the heroes or to distract them while the villain attends to other matters. On some occasions, the deathtrap is a machine that \"absorbs\" the energy from the hero/heroes.\n</p><p>Another rationalization for a deathtrap is when a particular villain simply enjoys leaving his victims some small chance of survival, just for the sake of sport. Such \"sporting\" villains include <a href=\"/wiki/Riddler\" title=\"Riddler\">the Riddler</a>, who has an uncontrollable compulsion to create intellectual challenges for his enemies. Also included in this list is the <a href=\"/wiki/Jigsaw_Killer\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Jigsaw Killer\">Jigsaw Killer</a>, who places his victims in life-or-death situations to prove that they appreciate life. <a href=\"/wiki/Joker_(comics)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Joker (comics)\">The Joker</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Arcade_(Marvel_Comics)\" title=\"Arcade (Marvel Comics)\">Arcade</a> are other villains who simply enjoy the challenge.\n</p><p>On occasion, the villain may employ a slow deathtrap because they enjoy their victim's suffering prior to death, either due to sadistic tendencies or a desire for painful vengeance.\n</p><p>In a similar vein, the villain, often a <a href=\"/wiki/Megalomania\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Megalomania\">megalomaniac</a>, may feel that, as a reflection of his own imagined greatness, it would be \"beneath him\" to murder his enemy like any common criminal, and that his enemy's death should be the worthy spectacle that a successful deathtrap would provide. In contrast, he may feel that his enemy, having provided him with a worthy challenge in their earlier encounters, himself \"deserves\" such a grandiose death, or that the enmity between the two is so \"epic\" that it merits no less than such a conclusion.\n</p><p>Conversely, the protagonists' act of falling into such a trap may itself be the reason they are written off and left unattended. The villain, disappointed in such a non-threatening opponent, loses interest, and intentionally leaves some chance of escape for the protagonists to \"redeem\" themselves. However, the disillusioned villain tends to assume that the chance is minuscule. Despite secretly hoping that the opponent survives and proves worthy of interest, the now-bored villain is invariably shocked when that actually occurs.\n</p><p>If fully serious, the villain may simply be too insane to recognize the impracticality of the situation, although this characterization is rarely seen outside of deliberately parodic characters such as <a href=\"/wiki/Dr._Evil\" title=\"Dr. Evil\">Dr. Evil</a>.\n</p><p>A more recent reason is villains do it simply because it is considered 'tradition' or 'rule' of being a supervillain to place a hero in a deathtrap and then leave them to their fate. This even goes as far as heroes, or other villains, insulting a villain for attempting to avoid using a deathtrap or staying to watch. <a href=\"/wiki/Batmen_of_All_Nations#Club_of_Villains\" title=\"Batmen of All Nations\">El Sombrero</a> is one villain who exemplifies this reason.\n</p><p>When a hero's sidekick or loved one is placed in a deathtrap, its purpose is often to distract the hero, occupying time and attention while the villain pursues their evil plan. Less frequently, the villain intends to instill grief and guilt as a means of defeating a hero that cannot be defeated physically. Multiple secondary characters may be placed in deathtraps to offer the hero an agonizing choice, ostensibly forcing the hero to save one victim and leave the other(s) to die.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Famous_examples\">Famous examples</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Deathtrap_(plot_device)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Famous examples\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Engineer%27s_Thumb\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Engineer&#39;s Thumb\">The Engineer's Thumb</a></i> (<a href=\"/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes\" title=\"Sherlock Holmes\">Sherlock Holmes</a> story): the  engineer Victor Hatherley is trapped inside a hydraulic press which would crush him to a pulp\n<ul><li>Escape method: a woman working for the villains but not sharing their criminal ruthlessness opens a side panel at the last moment, allowing Hatherley to escape</li></ul></li>\n<li><i><a href=\"/wiki/Raiders_of_the_Lost_Ark\" title=\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\">Raiders of the Lost Ark</a></i>: Sealing <a href=\"/wiki/Indiana_Jones\" title=\"Indiana Jones\">Indiana Jones</a> and Marion in the Well of Souls\n<ul><li>Escape method: Seeing a possible tunnel entrance, Jones climbed a statue and toppled it towards the wall to create an entrance to a passageway that led to the outside.</li></ul></li>\n<li><i><a href=\"/wiki/Live_and_Let_Die_(film)\" title=\"Live and Let Die (film)\">Live and Let Die</a></i>: Doctor Kananga and a minion tie James Bond and Solitare to a platform to be lowered into a shark infested pool to be eaten alive.\n<ul><li>Escape method: Without the villains seeing, Bond activates his watch's <a href=\"/wiki/Rotary_saw\" title=\"Rotary saw\">rotary saw</a> function to cut through his restraints to free himself and attack Kananga.</li></ul></li>\n<li><i><a href=\"/wiki/Goldfinger_(novel)\" title=\"Goldfinger (novel)\">Goldfinger</a></i>: James Bond is shackled spreadeagled to a table and a <a href=\"/wiki/Circular_saw\" title=\"Circular saw\">circular saw</a> (a <a href=\"/wiki/Laser\" title=\"Laser\">laser</a> in the <a href=\"/wiki/Goldfinger_(film)\" title=\"Goldfinger (film)\">film</a>) is approaching to cut him in half.

The entire second half of the film can also be seen as an extended deathtrap situation, where the thousands of people on board find themselves faced with a painful and absurd death, due to their having bought tickets or enlisted as crew on the glamorous ship, the epitome of technical progress and luxury, and now have to either reach the lifeboats and escape or else accept their death. The villain here, in a sense, is the ship and its careless masters.</li>\n<li><i><a href=\"/wiki/Final_Destination_(franchise)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Final Destination (franchise)\">Final Destination</a></i>: The plot of the series revolves around several people surviving a catastrophe because one of them had a premonition of it. In doing this the survivors have cheated Death, a malevolent and unseen force that sets up deathtraps to kill off the survivors in the order in which they had originally died.</li></ul>\n<p><br />\nA simpler variation on the deathtrap is the <b>villain speech</b>, also known as <i><a href=\"/wiki/Monologue#Monologuing\" title=\"Monologue\">monologuing</a></i>. The villain, after having captured the hero or another victim, gives a long speech taunting and sneering at his victim, pontificating on how said victim will soon die, and reminiscing over how he tried for so long to get his kill and is now about to reap the reward. Villains may also give away details of their evil plots, on the rationale that the victim will die immediately and the villain often believes their victim deserves to know. This speech, given when the villain could have just killed the victim in a matter of seconds, is invariably used to give another character time to come in and save the victim, or for the victim to escape. In <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Incredibles\" title=\"The Incredibles\">The Incredibles</a></i> (which used the term \"monologuing\"), <a href=\"/wiki/Mr._Incredible\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Mr. Incredible\">Mr. Incredible</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Frozone\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Frozone\">Frozone</a> attacked villains in the middle of their speeches (Mr. Incredible is seen attacking <a href=\"/wiki/Syndrome_(The_Incredibles)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Syndrome (The Incredibles)\">Syndrome</a> and Frozone is mentioned to have attacked Baron von Ruthless off-camera). In a literary sense, the villain speech is also used as a form of <a href=\"/wiki/Exposition_(literary_technique)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Exposition (literary technique)\">exposition</a>.\n</p><p>Even in relatively realistic stories, villains will often take a moment to say something pithy before finishing off the victim. The antagonist would often leave the victim to die whilst they commit their evil scheme. This is echoed in the film <i><a href=\"/wiki/2001_-_A_Space_Odyssey\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"2001 - A Space Odyssey\">2001 - A Space Odyssey</a></i> when Hal the supercomputer, confident that Dave will soon perish outside the ship, tells him that he is about to take control of the expedition and then sees Dave off with the flat remark: \"This conversation can have no meaningful purpose anymore - goodbye!\". Dave manages to make his way inside and kill Hal.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Spoofs\">Spoofs</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Deathtrap_(plot_device)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Spoofs\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The concept of the deathtrap/monologue is featured in many <a href=\"/wiki/Satire\" title=\"Satire\">satires</a>.\n</p>\n<ul><li>Deathtraps were spoofed heavily in the <a href=\"/wiki/Austin_Powers_(film_series)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Austin Powers (film series)\">Austin Powers</a> movies, including a replication of <a href=\"/wiki/James_Bond\" title=\"James Bond\">James Bond</a>'s Shark Infested Water deathtrap. It is first introduced as \"an easily escapeable situation involving an overly elaborate and exotic death\" with Austin placed on a platform over a pool (which <a href=\"/wiki/Dr._Evil\" title=\"Dr. Evil\">Dr. Evil</a> calls \"the unnecessarily slow-moving dipping mechanism\"). The trap is escaped by swinging on a grapple of dental floss. As the intended sharks with laserbeams  were unavailable due to the complexities of international law regarding endangered species (much to Dr. Evil's disappointment), ill-tempered <a href=\"/wiki/Mutant\" title=\"Mutant\">mutant</a> seabass are used instead. As part of the spoof, <a href=\"/wiki/Scott_Evil\" title=\"Scott Evil\">Scott Evil</a>, Dr. Evil's son, insists that the deathtrap is pointless and that they could simply shoot them with a pistol, which is nearby, and yells at his father for the further incompetence of leaving them alone. Dr Evil responds that not watching the killing but assuming it went well makes perfect sense.</li>\n<li>In the <a href=\"/wiki/Sitcom\" title=\"Sitcom\">sitcom</a> <i><a href=\"/wiki/Blackadder\" title=\"Blackadder\">Blackadder</a></i>, <a href=\"/wiki/Prince_Edmund_(Blackadder)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Prince Edmund (Blackadder)\">Prince Edmund</a> is captured by his nemesis, the Hawk, who straps him into a chair which, in sixty seconds, will mutilate him in a variety of ways.

In another episode, Lord Flashheart is confronted by a villain who begins an evil villain speech. However, rather than waiting for him to finish, Flashheart merely shoots him without warning.</li>\n<li><i><a href=\"/wiki/Curse_of_Monkey_Island\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Curse of Monkey Island\">Curse of Monkey Island</a></i> makes fun of this clich\u00e9.

By this dialogue, interesting background story that connect the games together are given to the player.

I did it thirty-five minutes ago.\"</li>\n<li>In <i>The Simpsons</i> episode \"<a href=\"/wiki/You_Only_Move_Twice\" title=\"You Only Move Twice\">You Only Move Twice</a>\", which generally spoofs Bond villain clich\u00e9s, supervillain/great boss <a href=\"/wiki/Hank_Scorpio\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hank Scorpio\">Hank Scorpio</a> has \"Mr. Bont\" strapped to a table with a laser \u00e0 la Goldfinger.

Scorpio's henchmen promptly shoot Bont.</li>\n<li>Some incarnations of the <a href=\"/wiki/Evil_Overlord_List\" title=\"Evil Overlord List\">Evil Overlord List</a> point out the impracticality of deathtraps.
