Imandar Daurey (English:Honest Woodcutter) is Nepalese story which is commonly told from old people to young people, and by teachers in primary schools. This basic moral of the story is "don't lie and don't be greedy". The story has also been animated and shown as part of social awareness campaigns for people living in cities.     Imandar Daurey is believed to be created around the 1990s or the 2000s but its popularity began to grow in the 2000s. This is adaptation of an older story, Panchatantra, about a woodcutter who is rewarded by a goddess for his honesty. Imandar Daurey is a story about a poor man named Daurey who makes a living from cutting down trees and selling firewood to the market. One day while in the middle of the jungle he saw giant log in the ground. Daurey tries to cut down the log, but when he does so, he loses his axe in the pond. He then starts to cry, complaining about how unlucky his day was. While he was crying a jalpari (mermaid) appears from the pond, offering to help him find his axe. She goes down in the pond then proceeds to offer him a gold axe, asking if it is his axe. Daurey responds, stating that it is not his axe. She then offers him a silver axe, leading to the same response from Daurey as before. Finally she offers him his axe and Daurey says that it is his axe, thanking her for it. The jalpari gets impressed by his honesty, rewarding him with gold and a silver axe which he sells to buy a good house. His neighbor, curious as to how he had managed buy the house, asks him about it. Daurey tells him what had happened, causing his neighbor to see a  way to easily make money. The next day he does the same thing as Daurey. The Jalpari appears, offering him a silver axe, and he says it is not his axe. She then offers him a gold axe, which he claims is his. The jalpari, seeing his lie, becomes angered and refuses to help him find his axe.
