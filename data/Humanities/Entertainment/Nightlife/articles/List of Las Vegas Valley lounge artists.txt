 This page lists Las Vegas Valley lounge music performers. The pioneers of the Las Vegas lounge scene were The Mary Kaye Trio with Mary Kaye. Although the lounge existed in Las Vegas hotels, it was not until the trio started the "Dusk til Dawn"[clarification needed] that the nightlife existed in Las Vegas.   Many credit Louis Prima as the original, but the trio started it five years before Prima came to Vegas. Prima and Keely Smith followed the trio in the origins of Las Vegas nightlife.
