His inappropriate laughter and persistent pun and joke telling was a sharp contrast to his personality as an intellectual theological scholar, known for his exceptional memory as opposed to his sense of humor. This behavior was generally prompted by environmental stimuli such as physician\u2019s rounds or blood sampling. To the patient, his behavior seemed normal, which explains why he remained nondiscriminating toward his jokes, their context, and their impression on those around him. Neurological examination revealed mild spastic left <a href=\"/wiki/Hemiparesis\" title=\"Hemiparesis\">hemiparesis</a> with minimal motor coordination and impairment of voluntary fine movements. <a href=\"/wiki/Single-photon_emission_computed_tomography\" title=\"Single-photon emission computed tomography\">Single-photon emission computed tomography</a> (SPECT) showed hypoperfusion, or decreased blood flow, in the right frontoparietal area. Additionally, verbal and performance tests showed evidence of poor concentration skills, high distractibility, and difficulty with visual-spatial tasks. The patient\u2019s performance on the <a href=\"/wiki/Wisconsin_Card_Sorting_Test\" title=\"Wisconsin Card Sorting Test\">Wisconsin Card Sorting Test</a> was severely impaired, suggesting frontal dysfunction.<sup id=\"cite_ref-PhD_3-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-PhD-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Case #2: A 56-year-old man, KS, was admitted to the hospital with signs of a putaminal <a href=\"/wiki/Cerebral_hemorrhage\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cerebral hemorrhage\">hemorrhage</a>, including dense paralysis on the left side of his body and face, difficulty swallowing, and visual field defects on his left side. On the fifth day of hospitalization, he was alert and cooperative with no disorientation, delusion, or <a href=\"/wiki/Pseudobulbar_affect\" title=\"Pseudobulbar affect\">emotional lability</a>. He then became euphoric and outspoken, speaking in puns and witticisms with an exaggerated smile. The content of his conversations, however, was not bizarre or random. He would work in puns and jokes while speaking his concerns about his other physical symptoms from the stroke in a coherent manner. Sometimes he would not crack a smile at something he said to make others around him laugh hysterically, while other times he could not appreciate others' jokes. During this time, KS also developed <a href=\"/wiki/Hypersexuality\" title=\"Hypersexuality\">hypersexuality</a>, using erotic words and inappropriate behavior toward the female hospital staff. Before his stroke, KS's family reported he did make jokes on occasion, but never in this bizarre manner, and never behaved impolitely to women. MRI tests showed bleeding at the right <a href=\"/wiki/Putamen\" title=\"Putamen\">putamen</a>, extending into the posterior and lateral portions of the right <a href=\"/wiki/Thalamus\" title=\"Thalamus\">thalamus</a> and defects in the thalamus and right basal ganglion. Another test showed deficits in recent memory, orientation, abstract thinking, drawing, and verbal fluency.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Chen_4-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Chen-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Case #3: A 23 year-old man, DD, right handed, was found dead in his apartment, with no apparent physical trauma, only having his face contorted in a big smile. In the weeks prior to death, after making a joke he would sometimes grab his chest with a painful look. Otherwise showing nothing but healthy, some would even say extraordinary, signs of vitality.\nThe deceased had been receiving treatment for the past few weeks prior to his death, after friends and family noticed an increase in the quality and frequency of his puns, humorous observations and other witticisms (although they only admitted the former in a posthumous, or in this case post humorous survey).\nA post-mortem MRI scan revealed significant damage to the patient\u2019s hippo campus and the parts of the brain that regulate humor. The time that this deterioration started, correlates with the mentioned physical ailments, leading to his team of medical examiners, led by the acclaimed Dr. Hancock, to suspect that indeed the cause of death was a severe case of Witzelsucht. It is sometimes also referred to with the medical terms \u201cExcrementum Taurus\u201d or \u201cDaan Syndrome\u201d.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Altered_sense_of_humor\">Altered sense of humor</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Witzelsucht&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Altered sense of humor\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In both case studies, patients showed an altered sense of humor, mostly in regard to producing and appreciating humor. The right hemisphere is involved with processing speed and problem solving, which plays a role in humor processing.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Shammi_5-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Shammi-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> These patients have difficulty fully interpreting a joke's content, but can recognize the importance of the form of a joke. Patients with witzelsucht often find <a href=\"/wiki/Non_sequitur_(literary_device)\" title=\"Non sequitur (literary device)\">non sequiturs</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Slapstick\" title=\"Slapstick\">slapstick</a> humor, and <a href=\"/wiki/Pun\" title=\"Pun\">puns</a> funniest since these forms of humor do not require integration of content across sentences. In other words, the end of the joke is not dependent on the first part; one does not need to make a logical connection to understand humor. Patients show no change in understanding simple logic, and understand the importance of surprise in humor (hence why they choose slapstick humor instead of the \u201ccorrect\u201d punch line); however, once they have registered this surprise, they cannot connect the punch line to the body of the joke to fully appreciate the true humor behind the joke.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Shammi_5-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Shammi-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> Successful jokes require a juxtaposition of the sound and the meaning of words used to understand the punch line. However, patients with witzelsucht have difficulty connecting the two, resulting in an inability to appreciate humor.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Goel_6-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Goel-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Additionally, patients show no emotional reaction to humor, whether produced by themselves or others. This lack of responsiveness is due to dissociation between their cognitive and affective responses to humorous stimuli. That is, even when a patient understands that a joke is funny (based on quantitative brain activity), they do not respond with laughter, or even a smile. While they have grasped the cognitive basis of humor, they do not affectively respond.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Shammi_5-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Shammi-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> This also considered a cognitive component of empathy, affecting ability to take the perspective of others; hence why patients often do not respond to humor produced by other people.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Hypersexuality\">Hypersexuality</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Witzelsucht&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Hypersexuality\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>This symptom is much rarer than the unusual use of puns and nonresponsive sense of humor most notably seen in witzelsucht patients. Nonetheless, patients can still exhibit hypersexuality by making sexual comments at socially inappropriate times. Some signs of this behavior include impulsivity, poor judgment, deficits in emotional regulation, excess preoccupation with sex, and cognitive rigidity (difficulty in appreciating another\u2019s emotion, inability to yield).<sup id=\"cite_ref-Reid_7-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Reid-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> More than likely this symptom is linked to amygdala damage that can occur during a stroke, which can also induce frontal lobe damage.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Humor_recognition_in_the_brain\">Humor recognition in the brain</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Witzelsucht&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Humor recognition in the brain\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><span id=\"Frontal_lobe\"></span>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Role_of_the_frontal_lobe\">Role of the frontal lobe</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Witzelsucht&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Role of the frontal lobe\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Damage to the <a href=\"/wiki/Frontal_lobe\" title=\"Frontal lobe\">frontal lobe</a> has been related to changes in personality. The frontal lobes are crucial for the development of personality, sense of self, and humor development. Anatomically, there are meaningful connections between the frontal lobes (specifically the polar and ventral/medial areas) and other brain regions related to affective-emotional responses. Early cases of witzelsucht observed damage to the <a href=\"/wiki/Ventromedial_prefrontal_cortex\" title=\"Ventromedial prefrontal cortex\">mesial-orbital region</a> of the frontal lobe.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Shammi_5-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Shammi-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> In general, damage to this area results in puerility, disinhibition, and an inappropriate jocular affect. <span class=\"citation-needed-content\" style=\"padding-left:0.1em; padding-right:0.1em; color:#595959; border:1px solid #DDD;\">Subjects with damage to this part of the brain show a preference for <a href=\"/wiki/Gallows_humor\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Gallows humor\">gallows humor</a></span><sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"margin-left:0.1em; white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources. (May 2014)\">citation needed</span></a></i>&#93;</sup>. The frontal lobes are also involved in processing narrative conversation and understanding abstract or indirect forms of communication, such as sarcasm. This is a critical role in humor appreciation. Subjects with damage to the <a href=\"/wiki/Superior_frontal_gyrus\" title=\"Superior frontal gyrus\">right superior frontal cortex</a> (Brodmann areas 8/9) choose punchlines which are simplistic and do not integrate content across a narrative. This region of the brain is responsible for problem-solving skills and holding information to recall during processing (i.e. working memory). Only damage to the right hemisphere of the brain, not the left, is linked to humor. Specifically, pathology in the right frontal lobe (specifically the superior and anterior regions) correlated with deficits in humor in patients as opposed to other brain regions in the right hemisphere.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Shammi_5-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Shammi-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>One of the main roles of the right hemisphere, which is organizing and integrating information, is found in the right frontal lobe. Additionally, it is also responsible for <a href=\"/wiki/Episodic_memory\" title=\"Episodic memory\">episodic memory</a>, which is essential in humor appreciation. A person may remember experiences in order to fully understand a joke in the current context. This remembering of personally experienced events is considered episodic memory. Appreciating humor requires integrated operations within the brain, all of which can be processed in the right frontal lobe. It has been considered a heteromodal cortex, which means that it responds to multiple stimuli, capable of interpreting internal and external sensory input. The coordination of these sensory interpretations are ideal for humor appreciation and production, one of the highest and most evolved human cognitive functions.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Shammi_5-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Shammi-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Functional_behavior\">Functional behavior</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Witzelsucht&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Functional behavior\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>One of the major theories of humor is the <a href=\"/wiki/Theories_of_humor\" title=\"Theories of humor\">incongruity-resolution model</a>, which considers humor appreciation as a problem-solving task.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Samson_8-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Samson-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> The punch-line, which can be taken out of place from the body of the text, must be detected and then connected with the lead. This logical process is an important role in the frontal lobes; therefore, damage to this area of the brain leads to difficulty connecting the start of a joke to the punch-line. In incongruity-resolution, there is more information to be integrated within the frontal lobe (i.e. when the joke makes more sense, in a somewhat logical way, the scripts within the brain can be unified better.) Patients with witzelsucht cannot make that logical connection in incongruity-resolution jokes, hence why they communicate through nonsense humor, mostly in the form of puns and <a href=\"/wiki/Non_sequitur_(logic)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Non sequitur (logic)\">non sequiturs</a>.\n</p><p>Two other components related to the frontal lobes contribute to the social behavior of a witzelsucht patient. Previous studies have established a connection with the right hemisphere and emotional responsiveness. The specific anatomical location is still unclear, but it was shown that the right frontal operculum was most relevant in emotional gesturing.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Shammi_5-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Shammi-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> This, combined with the dissociation between cognitive and affective stimuli can explain why patients show no reaction to humor. Personality and drawing on past experiences have been shown to influence humor processing and appreciation. A person may remember past experiences in their own life in order to fully understand a joke in the current context. This remembering of personally experienced events is considered <a href=\"/wiki/Episodic_memory\" title=\"Episodic memory\">episodic memory</a>, which is processed within the frontal lobes.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Shammi_5-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Shammi-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> Additionally, this inability to remember past experiences could also cause a person to forget what is socially appropriate; which could explain why witzelsucht patients sometimes say hypersexual comments in public.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Hypersexuality_in_the_brain\">Hypersexuality in the brain</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Witzelsucht&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Hypersexuality in the brain\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Amygdala\" title=\"Amygdala\">amygdala</a> plays a significant role in processing emotional stimuli and producing affective responses, which in turn is utilized in social interactions. The amygdala regulates the attachment of emotional significance to corresponding sensory stimuli. Lesions in the amygdala do not disrupt a specific sexual mechanism. Instead, they disturb the emotional processing of stimuli, which causes random and/or inappropriate responses. The amygdala has a positive effect on sexual behavior by allowing the appropriate attachment of emotional significance to external sexual stimuli.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Baird_2004_9-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Baird_2004-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> Previous human studies have shown an association between temporal lobe dysfunction and altered sexual behavior.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Baird_2004_9-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Baird_2004-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> There has also been evidence of hypersexual behavior after epileptic seizures.
