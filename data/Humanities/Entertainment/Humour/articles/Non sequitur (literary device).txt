A non-sequitur (English:  /ˌnɒnˈsɛkwɪtər/; Classical Latin: [noːn ˈsɛkᶣɪtʊr] "it does not follow") is a conversational and literary device, often used for comedic purposes. It is something said that, because of its apparent lack of meaning relative to what preceded it,  seems absurd to the point of being humorous or confusing. This use of the term is distinct from the non-sequitur in logic, where it is a fallacy. The expression is Latin for "it does not follow."  It comes from the words "non" meaning not, and the deponent verb sequor, sequi, secutus sum meaning 'to follow'. Deponent verbs have passive forms but active meanings.  A non-sequitur can denote an abrupt, illogical, or unexpected turn in plot or dialogue by including a relatively inappropriate change in manner. A non-sequitur joke sincerely has no explanation, but it reflects the idiosyncrasies, mental frames and alternative world of the particular comic persona.
