Office humor, also often called workplace humor, refers to the role of humor as used within the workplace.  It is a subject that receives significant attention from students of industrial and organizational psychology and of the sociology of work, as well as in popular culture. Humor is an inevitable part of the social environment of work, and has been argued to be a potential tool for improving worker satisfaction and organizational results.  Studies have suggested that humor can increase worker cohesiveness, creativity, motivation, and resilience in the face of adversity.     On the other hand, workplace humor (especially negative humor) can also be misused to reinforce bigotry, denigrate minorities, create an atmosphere of physical or sexual harassment, or as a management tool to reinforce managerial authority.   Inappropriate workplace humor may be deemed as "evidence in sexual harassment, discrimination and hostile work environment cases".   It has led to serious consequences in cases such as the Krull case, where the ombudsman of King County, Washington was fired for sending a copy of the 1894 booklet Instruction and Advice for the Young Bride to his soon-to-be-married assistant,  or Chevron Corporation having to pay more than $2 million as a settlement with four employees after an interoffice email circulated on the subject of "25 Reasons Why Beer is Better Than Women".  Office humor is the focus of comic strips (Dilbert, Help Desk, User Friendly, Sosiaalisesti rajoittuneet), movies (Office Space, Head Office), TV series (The Peter Principle, The Office, Dilbert), and contemporary art (as in works by Mike Kelley  ).
