The unsuccessful self-treatment of a case of "writer's block" is a humorous academic article by psychologist Dennis Upper about writer's block. It contains no content outside title and journal formatting elements, including a humorous footnote. Published in 1974 in a peer reviewed journal, Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis, it is recognized as the shortest academic article ever  and a classic example of humour in science,  or at the very least among behavioral psychologists.   It has been cited at least 60 times.  The article received a humorous positive review which was published alongside the article.  The article has led to at least three similarly humorous and peer-reviewed, published replication studies,    and several similar papers.     More seriously, the paper is said to be a case reinforcing the image of a writer's block as a "blank page",  and encouraging brevity in writing.  It has been also used as an example that humor can indeed be found in academic publishing.
