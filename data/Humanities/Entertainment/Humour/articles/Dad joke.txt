"Dad joke" is a pejorative term used to describe a corny or predictable joke, typically a pun.  Generally inoffensive, dad jokes are traditionally told by fathers among family, either with sincere humorous intent, or to intentionally provoke a negative reaction to its "dagginess".  One of the most common "dad jokes" goes as follows:  A child will say to the dad, "I am hungry,"  to which the dad will reply, "Hi, Hungry, I am Dad." Many dad jokes may be considered anti-jokes, deriving humour from an intentionally unfunny punchline.  The term has spread into general use, receiving mentions in Australian quiz show Spicks and Specks,  and American sitcom How I Met Your Mother.  jp:オヤジギャグ
