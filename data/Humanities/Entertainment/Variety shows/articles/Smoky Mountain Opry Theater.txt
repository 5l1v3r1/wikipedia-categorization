The Smoky Mountain Opry Theater (formerly known as The Miracle Theater and Louise Mandrell Theater) is a theater established in 1997. In Fall 1997, the theater was opened as stage for country singer Louise Mandrell.  In 2005, the theater was purchased by The Fee Hedrick Family Entertainment Group, while Mandrell performed her last show on New Year's Eve that same year.  After a $15 million installation,  the theater was reopened as "The Miracle Theater" on April 13, 2006.  Its main play, "The Miracle" was performed from its opening in 2006  to its closing on October 22, 2011.  The musical was about the life of Jesus Christ.  The musical consisted of live animals, sword-fights, and wire-harnessing angels  and was composed by David Legg and written by Linda Nell Cooper.  Other shows that were performed at the Miracle Theater included the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical, Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.  In September 2007, the Miracle Theater received national attention when it spent about $90,000 on an USA Today advertisement, which indirectly criticized Kathy Griffin's Primetime Emmy Award acceptance speech.  On March 15, 2012, the theater re-opened as "Smoky Mountain Opry Theater".
