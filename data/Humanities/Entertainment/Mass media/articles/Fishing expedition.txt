A fishing expedition is an informal, pejorative term for a non-specific search for information, especially incriminating information. It is most frequently organized by policing authorities. In the UK, Abu Hamza and Yaser al-Sirri,  Sir Cliff Richard,  Jim Davidson,  and the late Edward Heath  were each subjected to this tactic. In Sir Cliff Richard's case, the police 'tipped off' the BBC that a search was imminent. A BBC helicopter filmed as five police cars arrived at the singer's home and eight officers searched the premises, 'all of it broadcast in dramatic pictures instantly sent around the world'. Sir Cliff was unaware of this, being away on holiday.  Former friends of the late prime minister Edward Heath complained that Mike Veale, Chief Constable of Wiltshire Police, had mounted a 'fishing expedition' in an 'unsatisfactory and prejudicial' investigation costing Â£1.5 million which had turned up 'no convincing evidence' that Heath had ever sexually assaulted anyone, according to Lord Hunt of Wirral.
