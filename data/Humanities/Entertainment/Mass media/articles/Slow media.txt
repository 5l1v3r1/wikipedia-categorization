Slow Media is a media consumption movement that opposes the high rate of media production and consumption in the digital age. It advocates for media that is thoroughly researched and widely accessible, not limited by the time necessary to produce or observe the work.  Slow media developed in response to complex media formats and instant communication methods characteristic of digital culture, in which "high volumes of information are updated in real-time and are perpetually at your fingertips." (Jolly, 2014)   Supporters of slow media criticize the spheres in which media is produced, shared, and consumed as valuing tempo and dramatic presentation over the substance and credibility of a work, in order to draw the attention of consumers.
