Boomers! Parks is a chain of family entertainment centers which feature indoor activities such as carousels, kiddie swings, restaurants, musical shows, and video game arcades, and outdoor activities such as miniature golf, kiddie rides, bumper boats, batting cages, go-karts, kiddie roller coasters, and laser tag. The Modesto, Irvine, and San Diego locations each have a ride called the Flamethrower.  The Boomers! Parks brand is a DBA name adopted in 2001 by the Palace Entertainment chain, which was founded in 1998 through the merger of Camelot Parks, Palace Park, Boomers!, Grand Prix Race-O-Rama, and Family Fun Center. The official slogan of Palace Entertainment owned Boomers! Parks is "Where Family Fun Rules!". In September 2014, Apex Parks Group purchased 10 Boomers locations from Palace Entertainment.  In 2015, Apex Parks Group rebranded one of the last Mountasia Family Fun Centers to a Boomers; thus making 11 total Boomers parks owned by Apex.
