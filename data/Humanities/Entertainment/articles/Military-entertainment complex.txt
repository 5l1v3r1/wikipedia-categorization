The military-entertainment complex is a concept relating to the cooperation between the military and entertainment industries to their mutual benefit, especially in such fields as cinema,  multimedia and virtual reality.    A related concept, the creative-industrial complex, describes the collaborative relationships between creative, industry, and military institutions for political and economic gain. An example of this in practice is Japan's Manga Military,  where the Self Defense Force uses  affective cultural resources to shape public perceptions of the country's military establishment.
