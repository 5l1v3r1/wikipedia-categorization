He said it was particularly important that the film be a melting pot of culture and good values which are a hallmark of people\u2019s identity\u2019. The aim of Sade Animated movie introduce Nigerian Icons such as popular popular Story Teller Jimi Solanke to the younger generation, as well as the traditional Bata dance and chants. \u2018I grew up in Lagos before going to the United Kingdom to study. I thought of the then <i>NTA</i> with Jimi Solanke, and I wanted SADE to make a statement,\u2019 said Miller who described Solanke as the \u2018Disney of Nigeria\u2019.\n</p><p>Initially Sade was thought up as a series for children, a way to create productions that embody the talent, innovation, cultural values and creativity that are bound in Nigeria and Africa but viewed all over the world. As it moved onto the film stage, Casting Director and Production Manager Abiodun Aleja and Line Production Kate Adepegba were introduced as well as Pastor Olukayode Owolabi as Executive Producer. Pastor Owolabi recently spoke about faith influencing the direction of the film; \u2018As a pastor, I thought of the <i>Bible</i> as a big book with different segments that can be scripted and adapted into a movie. For me it\u2019s about giving back to the people. When Miller came along, we began to look into things we could do together. Then this idea of a family-oriented movie came. Not only is it full of action, it will also teach you how to treat people. If Nigerians can treat their dogs and cats very well, they will treat their neighbours very well.\u2019\n</p><p>Previously Miller has written a number of educational entertainment content for children including acclaimed nursery rhymes and songs. Sade will be his first feature film. Miller says the aim of SADE is to rekindle the African folklore using modern cinematic technology. This was part of the testimonies that the crew and cast of SADE recently shared in Lagos when the film was unveiled to the media. Miller Luwoye also noted that the great spirit that the musicians and actors deployed in the production of the film made it a big success.\n</p><p><b>Casting</b>\n</p><p>For the casting it was extremely important to get the voices correct in terms of emphasis and dialect. It was also essential to re-introduce the correct pronunciation to a new audience for terms such as \u2018Bata\u2019. Miller utilised authentic Nigerian actors whose voices brought the film together and gave it its own identity. Casting was completed by production managers Abiodun Aleja and Kate Adepegba from a repertoire of experienced and talented actors and actresses. Abiodun decided not to hold auditions for the roles as he wanted to handpick the correct voices for the roles; \u2018Well, this is about voicing, and I can tell you that the actors we have in SADE are some of the best in the Nigerian film industry.\u2019\n</p><p><b>Animation</b>\n</p><p>The film uses Nigerian animators as well as LA based animators to create a unique, and unrivalled Nigerian film offering.  \n</p><p><b>Music &amp; Soundtrack</b>\n</p><p>The music and soundtrack features an array of popular Nigerian artists and composers, most notably of which is music superstar, <a href=\"/wiki/King_Sunny_Ad%C3%A9\" title=\"King Sunny Ad\u00e9\">King Sunny Ade</a>. Ade is famed for his juju style and has been called one of the most influential musicians of all time<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>. Filmmaker Miller Luwoye who is a huge fan of KSA was both surprised and delighted at his enthusiasm at being included in Sade<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>. \n</p><p>All songs on the soundtrack were written specifically for Sade and include <a href=\"/wiki/Cobhams_Asuquo\" title=\"Cobhams Asuquo\">Cobhams Asuquo</a>, Deola Adebiyi, Omolara Ayodele and productions from some of the hottest producers on the scene, including <a href=\"/wiki/Young_John\" title=\"Young John\">Young John</a>, Ini Dminstrel, Asuquo, Kent Edunjobi and others.\n</p><p>Tying in the music and storyline was of upmost importance to Lowoye who said recently; \u2018I thought there has to be a marriage of music and animation. When Hollywood wants to pass a message across, they do it through movie. For the first time, you will hear Bata sound in animation. As a matter of fact, one track in SADE features 10 drummers.\u2019\n</p><p><b>Release</b> \n</p><p>Country: Nigeria / United Kingdom: 2019 \n</p><p>The Original Motion soundtrack will be released&#160;: 2019\n</p><p><b>References</b>\n</p>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><cite class=\"citation news\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/04/king-sunny-ade-nigerias-decorated-musician/\">\"King Sunny Ade: Nigeria's most decorated musician - Vanguard News\"</a>. <i>Vanguard News</i>. 2018-04-14<span class=\"reference-accessdate\">.
