{"parse":{"title":"Composite print","pageid":20224395,"revid":512031941,"text":{"*":"<div class=\"mw-parser-output\"><p>A <b>composite print</b> is a print of a <a href=\"/wiki/Motion_picture\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Motion picture\">motion picture</a> in which both sound and picture have been printed alongside each other on the film. Before a motion picture is actually released, it consists of several components, one containing the visual image, one containing the sound as recorded on-set, another containing the <a href=\"/wiki/Film_score\" title=\"Film score\">musical score</a>, another containing <a href=\"/wiki/Sound_effect\" title=\"Sound effect\">sound effects</a>, etc. All of these are eventually blended and printed together into a composite print. \n</p><p>During the 1950s and 1960s, some movie spectacles, especially those in <a href=\"/wiki/Cinerama\" title=\"Cinerama\">Cinerama</a>, would have the sound and picture perfectly synchronized, but running on separate machines. This was necessary in three-strip Cinerama because the image consisted of three films  each forming a part of a gigantic picture, projected on a huge, deeply curved screen. The seven-track sound was recorded on <a href=\"/wiki/Magnetic_tape\" title=\"Magnetic tape\">magnetic tape</a>, which ran simultaneously with the three projectors.\n</p><p>In the case of some films, such as the world premiere engagement of <i><a href=\"/wiki/Carousel_(film)\" title=\"Carousel (film)\">Carousel</a></i>, which was made in <a href=\"/wiki/CinemaScope_55\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"CinemaScope 55\">CinemaScope 55</a>, a six-track soundtrack could not be accommodated on the film, so the sound was played on an interlocking tape machine. The general release of the film did use the standard four-track stereo soundtrack, printed alongside the visual image on the film.\n</p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw2229\nCached time: 20180915120305\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.004 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.007 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 1/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 0/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 1/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:20224395-0!canonical and timestamp 20180915120305 and revision id 512031941\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","*":"Film"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Carousel (film)"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"CinemaScope 55"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Cinerama"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Film score"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Magnetic tape"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Motion picture"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Sound effect"}],"templates":[],"images":[],"externallinks":[],"sections":[],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Composite print","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q5156770"}]}}
