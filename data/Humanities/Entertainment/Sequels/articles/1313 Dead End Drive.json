There are a total of sixteen characters, so it is almost always the case that players control more than one character. Players are required to keep the roles of their Character Cards secret from their opponents. Additionally there are thirty-two \"Playing Cards,\" which allow players to do special things during their turn such as spring traps or instantly move pawns to other rooms. There is also one \"Clock Strikes Midnight\" card that is placed at the bottom of the Playing Cards, and if this card is drawn by any player, the game ends.\n</p><p>During each turn, players roll two dice and move two pawns which correspond to each dice roll. Players are allowed to move any pawn on the board, regardless if they hold its corresponding Heir Card or not, so that they can move it closer to or further away from a trap space or the door. A pawn can be moved onto a Trap space by exact roll only, and when a pawn is moved onto a Trap space, the player must draw a card from the Playing Cards stack. To spring a trap, a player must have a corresponding trap card in their possession. Springing traps is not mandatory, however. There are also Secret Passage spaces that players can use to quickly travel around the mansion.\n</p><p>Also during the game, players must pay attention to Aunt Agatha's will, which changes with the death of each character. The will contains the portrait of each character and is organized in a chain-like fashion. Every character begins with a single money bag token, except for Spritzy, who begins with four, and Sedgewick, who begins with two. When a character is \"knocked off\", their money tokens go to the next character in line of the will. When the last surviving character of the will is knocked off, their money tokens go to the \"Pet Pals Retirement Home\", and no one receives the money. If a character escapes the mansion, their money bag tokens are removed from the will and their space on the will is skipped over if a character preceding them on the will is knocked off.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Ways_to_Win\">Ways to Win</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=1313_Dead_End_Drive&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Ways to Win\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The winner of the game is determined by the amount of money bag tokens each player has at the end of the game. Whoever has the most money bag tokens when every player is out of the mansion (either by death or by escape) is the winner of the game. If the bottom of the Playing Cards stack is reached and the \"Clock Strikes Midnight\" card is drawn, gameplay ends instantly and players must count the moneybags currently in their possession to determine the winner.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Traps\">Traps</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=1313_Dead_End_Drive&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Traps\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><i>1313 Dead End Drive</i> has five different booby traps that can be sprung throughout the mansion.\n</p>\n<ul><li><b>The Stair Trap</b> is located in the Art Room, and a lever can be pushed down on the top step to make the pawn on the trap fall off the stairway.</li>\n<li><b>The Fireplace Trap</b> is in the Grand Room, and an urn can be rotated to move the pawn on the trap around to the back of the fireplace.</li>\n<li><b>The Boar's Head Trap</b> is in the Trophy Room, and a lever can be lifted from the back of the wall to release the Boar's Head to drop it on the pawn under it.</li>\n<li><b>The Suit of Armor Trap</b> is in the Parlor Room, a lever can be pushed on the statue to make the suit of armor topple over onto the pawn.</li>\n<li><b>The Safe Trap</b> is in the Vault Room, and a lever can be pushed to make a piggybank hidden inside the safe shoot down the chute and strike the pawn.</li></ul>\n<p>Any player can move any pawn onto a Trap Space, but it must be by exact roll. To spring the trap to knock off the pawn, a player must use a corresponding Trap Card, which can be drawn from the Playing Cards stack. When a trap is sprung on a character, their pawn and Heir Card are placed on the table to signify that they are no longer in play.

Many of the aspects of the first game were passed on to the second, but there are several alterations: in 13 Dead End Drive, Aunt Agatha's Will is replaced by a \"Portrait\", which hangs over the fireplace and displays the portrait of any of the twelve (instead of sixteen) heirs. If an heir escapes while they are displayed in the portrait, they win the game. Instead of the \"Clock Strikes Midnight\" card, there are thirteen \"Detective Cards\" scattered throughout the Trap card pile. When a Detective card is drawn, a Detective pawn, which is waiting outside of the mansion, moves one space closer to the mansion. The game can end instantly if the thirteenth Detective card is drawn and the Detective pawn reaches the front door. Additionally, the Boar's Head trap is replaced by a Chandelier, and the Safe trap is replaced by a Bookshelf. Also, one of the characters from the original game, <b>Hickory</b>, the gardener, does not appear in this one.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span
