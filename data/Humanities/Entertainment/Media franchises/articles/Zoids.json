href=\"/w/index.php?title=Zoids&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Model kit lines\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>There have been a number of different Zoids model lines over the years, both in Japan and other countries. Between these lines, over 200 different designs have been released, some several times over. Several companies outside of Takara-Tomy have produced Zoids kits. This has led to Zoids being made as die-cast figures, highly detailed posing kits, smaller action figures and even PVC figurines.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Mechabonica\">Mechabonica</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Zoids&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Mechabonica\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The predecessors to Zoids. Released in 1982, <b>Mechabonica</b> was technically not a Zoids line, but is counted as such by collectors as it consisted of three models that would later be re-released as the first three Zoids (Garius, Elephantus, and Glidoler). The line was not very successful and was quickly dropped by TOMY.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Starzeta\">Starzeta</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Zoids&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Starzeta\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Starzeta was the Spanish version of the Mechabonica line. Since Tomy had no direct marketing power in Spain during the 80s the models were released under licence by a smaller company (Feber) but unfortunately the line performed even worse than its Japanese counterpart. The same 3 models were released but bizarrely they were given new color schemes; grey parts became silver and the dark blue caps became bright blue. The models were not given names but are listed as Starzeta I, II and III.\n</p><p>SZ IV (Garantula), SZ V (Aquadon) and SZ VI (Gorgodos) were supposedly planned as a continuation of the series but their release status is currently unknown.\n</p><p>The models are incredibly rare (even more so than the Japanese Mechabonica) and demand is boosted even further by their unique color schemes.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Original_American_release\">Original American release</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Zoids&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Original American release\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>TOMY sold the Mechabonica line in the United States and Europe in late 1982, under the name <b>Zoids</b>. The line was far more successful than Mechabonica, which led TOMY to reintroduce the line in Japan under the new name.\n</p><p>Later, a pair of original Zoids, the Power Zoids Tank and Serpent, were created exclusively for the European and North American markets and were never released in Japan. Other Zoids like the Bigasaur (renamed to Giant ZRK) were also released. <a href=\"/wiki/Radio_Shack\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Radio Shack\">Radio Shack</a> released the Mammoth Zoid in the US at the same time. While not a part of the release, it is generally counted with them.\nThe Original American Release is commonly abbreviated as <b>OAR</b> by fans and collectors.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Original_Japanese_Release\">Original Japanese Release</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Zoids&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Original Japanese Release\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In 1983, following the success of the OAR, TOMY reintroduced the Zoids line in Japan. The relaunched Japanese line, now entitled <b>Zoids</b>, was a success, running from 1983 until 1990. The Zoids line had its own \"Battle Story\" that was told serially on the backs of the model boxes and in catalogues.\n</p><p>Initially, the Zoids were divided into two distinct factions, the Helic Republic and the Zenebas Empire. In 1989, the Zenebas Empire was replaced with the Guylos Empire.\n</p><p>The Original Japanese Release is commonly abbreviated as <b>OJR</b>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Original_European_Release\">Original European Release</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Zoids&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Original European Release\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Zoids were also released in Europe, (and to a limited extent in Australia and South-East Asia), from 1984 to 1987 by TOMY. The models in this release were a mixture of ones directly ported over from the OJR, as well as recoloured Zoids, including the rare <i>Ghost Zoids</i> line. Additionally, the Tank and Serpent Power Zoids from the OAR were released. Most of the Zoids in the line were renamed.\n</p><p>The Zoids in the release were divided into two distinct factions, the Blue Zoids and the Red Mutants. The line had its own story, told in the UK Zoids comic.\n</p><p>The Original European Release is commonly abbreviated as <b>OER</b>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Robo_Strux\">Robo Strux</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Zoids&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Robo Strux\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><b>Robo Strux</b> were released in the US and Canada by TOMY, in 1985-86. All the Zoids in the line were OJR Zoids, however, some versions of the same model retained their original (OJR) color scheme, whereas other versions of the same model received a distinctive Robo Strux color scheme.  Thus, the Robo Strux line had two differently colored releases of several models.  Based on their color schemes, the Zoids were divided into two factions, the heroic Blue Guardians and the evil Red Mutants. However, there was no accompanying story or media.\n</p><p>Due to the lack of marketing and the relatively high prices of the models, Robostrux was rather short-lived.\n</p><p>Robostrux is commonly abbreviated as <b>RS</b>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"1:24_Scale_Zoids\">1:24 Scale Zoids</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Zoids&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: 1:24 Scale Zoids\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In 1988, TOMY launched a sub-line of the OJR, featuring larger-scale Zoids.

Initially, the Hasbro line consisted of just re-releases of Zoids from the <i>NJR</i>. However, they later began developing their own Zoid designs, as well as co-developing others with TOMY. Additionally, Hasbro had planned to re-release several <i>OJR</i> Zoids that had not been released in the <i>NJR</i>.\n</p><p>Although it was initially successful, Hasbro suspended the line in 2004, due to poor sales.

Its setting is loosely based on that of Battle Story, and follows Van Flyheight as he meets an amnesiac girl called Fiona and an organoid called Zeke. As the series progresses, Van meets various opponents, such as Raven, and friends, like Moonbay and Irvine, and eventually ends up helping Fiona in her quest to regain her memory and to find a mysterious entity called the \"Zoid Eve\". Their quest takes them into the thick of an ongoing war between the two factions of the Helic Republic and the Guylos Empire.\n</p><p>In the US the story of Chaotic Century is split into two seasons, with a time skip in the middle. In Japan <i>Guardian Force</i> is considered the second series. Three to four years after the initial arc (\"Chaotic Century\"), the second story (<i>Guardian Force</i>) begins. The two warring nations seen in the first arc have made peace, and to ensure it remains, they establish a joint military task force called the Guardian Force. Van becomes a part of this force, and after some time again goes searching for the elusive Zoid Eve. On the way, he meets up with both old and new friends and foes.\n</p><p>Despite being the first series created in Japan, Chaotic Century was the second series to be broadcast in English, following New Century.\n</p><p>As well as the anime series, there was a <i>Chaotic Century</i> manga published in Japan.

In New Century Zoid battles have become a tournament-based fighting competition. The main character is Bit Cloud, a junk dealer, who forms part of the Blitz Team. He becomes a pilot of their Zoid, the Liger Zero, a temperamental Zoid that previously had been unpilotable. Bit and Liger form a partnership and end up joining the Blitz Team in their various league matches. He is aided by his teammates, Leena Toros, Brad Hunter, Jamie Hemeros, as well as their leader, Dr. Steve Toros.\n</p><p>Along the way, Bit's unique Zoid gets the attention of the Backdraft Group, an organization who is trying to take over Zoid battles and make them more \"interesting\" by using illicit battles, often with no rules or regard to pilot safety. The Backdraft attempts to acquire the Liger Zero by any means possible.\n</p><p>New Century Zero has a number of animation cameos with Zoids from Chaotic Century and Guardian Force, which are the cause of much fan speculation but not explained.  Moonbay's Gustav can be seen in the background in one of the later episodes, the Backdraft shoots judge satellites down with a Death Stinger tail, the Death Saurer appearing as a model and in a background TV show, the three Geno Saurers that attack Berserk Fury, and the Ultrasaurus wreck on which Bit Cloud claims victory carries the Gravity Cannon on its side.\n</p><p>This was the first Zoids series to appear on American television, airing in Cartoon Network's <i><a href=\"/wiki/Toonami\" title=\"Toonami\">Toonami</a></i> block.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Fuzors_2\">Fuzors</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Zoids&amp;action=edit&amp;section=40\" title=\"Edit section: Fuzors\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Zoids_Fuzors\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Zoids Fuzors\">Zoids Fuzors</a></div>\n<p><i>Zoids: Fuzors</i> follows the adventures of team Mach Storm and RD, a novice Liger Zero pilot.

As the series unfolds RD and his friends Helmut, Sigma, Hop, Sweet and Matt get caught up in a plot to take over the city.  Eventually RD discovers the secret behind the mysterious \"Alpha Zoid\" and with the help of pilots from all over the city, defeats the Seismosaurus holding it under siege.\n</p><p>About half-way through the series, the show was removed from America's Cartoon Network, ending on a cliffhanger.  This was most likely a result of flagging ratings and toy sales, although its timeslot did not help matters.  However, the full series aired in Australia and was later shown in Japan, getting full DVD releases in both countries.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Genesis_2\">Genesis</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Zoids&amp;action=edit&amp;section=41\" title=\"Edit section: Genesis\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Zoids:_Genesis\" title=\"Zoids: Genesis\">Zoids: Genesis</a></div>\n<p><i>Zoids: Genesis</i> aired in 2005. At a certain point in time, there was a great quake on Planet Zi. An enormous crack ran through the planet, stretching as far as the seabeds to the high mountains. Volcanoes erupted with fire, and the sky was covered in darkness. Many cities were destroyed as they were swallowed in large areas, sinking underwater. This was known as \"Gods' Fury.\"\n</p><p>Before this large series of natural disasters, all civilizations were at their peak. All were destroyed by the disasters, and it was several thousand years before the inhabitants of Zi were able to re-establish themselves in any meaningful form. Survivors of the disasters gathered together and formed new civilizations; these groups searched for Zoids that are buried underground for human use.\n</p><p>The story begins in a village whose most precious item, a giant blade, is worshipped as a holy symbol. Ruuji, a teenage boy, discovers an ancient Liger-type Zoid, the Murasame Liger, while on a deep water salvage operation. His village is suddenly attacked by skeletal \"Bio-Zoids\" intent on securing the powerful Generator located in the village. During the attack, Ruuji awakens Murasame Liger and fends off the Bio-Zoids, however the Generator on which the village depends becomes damaged in subsequent attacks.
