 Sony Pictures Starship Troopers is an American military science-fiction media franchise based on the novel of the same name by Robert A. Heinlein. In December 2011, film producer Neal H. Moritz announced plans to produce a reboot of the Starship Troopers film franchise.  In November 2016, Columbia and Moritz announced the writing team of Mark Swift and Damian Shannon had been signed to pen the screenplay.  Verhoeven expressed skepticism at the proposed remake, citing reports that it draws heavily from the original militaristic 1959 novel.
