Moviefone is an American-based movie listing and information service. Moviegoers can obtain local showtimes, theatre information, film reviews, or advance tickets. The service is owned by  Helios and Matheson Analytics. In 1989, Russ Leatherman, Rob Gukeisen, Andrew Jarecki, Pat Cardamone, and Adam Slutsky launched the interactive telephone service, with initial service in New York City and Los Angeles.  Russ Leatherman provided the voice of "Mr. Moviefone" for the automated phone service.  After gaining popularity, it later expanded across the United States and eventually adopted an online presence as Moviefone.com. In 1999, AOL  purchased Moviefone for $388 million.  In 2001, Moviefone entered into a partnership with MovieTickets.com that crosslinked their ticketing offerings; by 2004, Moviefone's online arm was acquired outright by MovieTickets.com.  However, in 2012, Moviefone announced a partnership with MovieTickets.com's rival Fandango.   On February 23, 2014, it was reported that Moviefone would be shutting down its call-in service and its "777-FILM" phone number but would maintain its mobile app services.  On May 5, 2014, Moviefone was relaunched with a new look, an expansion into TV content, and a comprehensive search tool that allows users to find theaters, channels, and streaming services offering movies and television shows.  On April 5th, 2018, Helios and Matheson Analytics Inc., the majority owner of movie ticketing service MoviePass, announced the acquisition of Moviefone from Oath Inc. for $1 million in cash and $8 million in stock.
