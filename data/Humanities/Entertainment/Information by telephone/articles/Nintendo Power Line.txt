The Nintendo Power Line was a hotline that provided readers of Nintendo Power magazine hints to their favorite video games on Nintendo consoles, such as the Nintendo Entertainment System.  It ran from the publishing of the first issue publication of Nintendo Power to June 2010, due to the Internet becoming more widespread.  It was revived from November 11 to November 13, 2016 in celebration of the release of the NES Classic Edition.  The messages, however, were automated rather than being live.
