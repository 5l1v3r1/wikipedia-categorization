 Michael McIntyre's Big World Tour is a comedy tour by British comedian Michael McIntyre. The tour began in Mdina, Malta at the Malta Fairs and Conventions Centre on 21 April 2017, and will conclude in Auckland, New Zealand at Spark Arena on 21 June 2019. Following the success of his previous tours, most recently "Happy and Glorious", a world tour was announced in 2017. Tickets for the UK shows went on sale on 5 May 2017.  A high demand prompted many extra dates to be added at numerous venues and locations.  Shows in Australia and New Zealand sold out in record time,  selling out five arena shows in three days.  As of 29 April 2018, the tour is set to consist of 104 shows in total; 80 in Europe, 13 in Oceania, 3 in North America, 3 in Africa and 5 in Asia.
