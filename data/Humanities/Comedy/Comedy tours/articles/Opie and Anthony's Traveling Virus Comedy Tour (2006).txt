Opie and Anthony's Traveling Virus was the first of three comedy event series, concert tour  in 2006, starring comedians featured on the Opie and Anthony show on XM Satellite Radio and CBS Radio. It returned in the summer of 2007.  The August 26 show at PNC Bank Arts Center in Holmdel, New Jersey broke the record for the best selling comedy show at the venue, previously held by Jay Leno.  The tour is notable for the Philadelphia incident where comedian Bill Burr went on a 12-minute tirade attacking the audience after the previous act, Dom Irrera, was heckled heavily by the crowd.  A cell phone video recording of the rant has been posted on various video hosting sites. The video was also added onto the DVD release of Burr's Why Do I Do This? comedy special as an extra.  The tour was a longtime goal of Opie and Anthony, who wanted to reward the comedians appearing on their show over the years.   O&A were finally able to do the tour because of their terrestrial deal with CBS. As a result of a positive turnout to the 4 shows of 2006, there were 8 shows in 2007.
