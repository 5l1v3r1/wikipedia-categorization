Opie and Anthony's Traveling Virus was a comedy-based concert tour starting in 2006 and ending in 2008. It starred comedians featured on the Opie and Anthony show on XM Satellite Radio and CBS Radio.  The tour was a goal of Opie and Anthony's since coming together as a radio talk duo in Long Island in the early 1990s.  The tour was intended to reward the comedians that had been guesting on the show over the years, and to serve as a thank you to fans nationwide.  They were finally able to present the tour in 2006 because of their terrestrial radio deal with CBS. The tour appeared in four cities over four dates. The most notable of them was Philadelphia due to an incident where comedian Bill Burr went on a 12-minute tirade attacking the audience after the previous act, Dom Irrera, was heckled heavily by the crowd.  A cell phone video recording of the rant has been posted on various video hosting sites. The video was also added onto the DVD release of Burr's Why Do I Do This? comedy special as an extra.  The 2007 show debuted in Las Vegas, Nevada, seven additional shows were announced following this event.  Due to comedians being consistently booed during the 2007 tour, following Burr's moment in 2006, the 2008 full tour was eventually canceled in favor of one final show held on August 2, 2008.  According to Opie and Anthony the tour was cancelled due to the crowd consistently booing new comedians off the stage.
