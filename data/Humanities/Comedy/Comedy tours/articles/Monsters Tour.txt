The Monsters Tour was a comedy tour by British comedian Lee Evans which turned out to be his final tour before his retirement immediately after the end of the tour but Evans has returned to comedy.     The tour visited: Bournemouth, Brighton, Nottingham, Sheffield, Birmingham, London, Manchester, Glasgow, Leeds, Aberdeen, Liverpool, Newcastle, Dublin, Belfast and Cardiff with tickets going on sale in late May 2013.   The tour follows a fairly similar route to Evans' 2011 Roadrunner Tour.  A live DVD was recorded at the NIA, Birmingham on Saturday 20 September with Lee receiving a standing ovation following the finale. On 20 November, Lee announced that this tour would be his last tour ever, subsequently, announcing his retirement from comedy.
