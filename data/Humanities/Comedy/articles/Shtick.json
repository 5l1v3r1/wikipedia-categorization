The English word for \"piece\" or \"thing\" is sometimes used in a similar context. Another variant is \"bits of business\" or just \"bits\". <i>Shtick</i> may refer to an adopted persona, usually for comedy performances, that is maintained consistently (though not necessarily exclusively) across the performer's career. In this usage, the recurring personalities adopted by Laurel and Hardy through all of their many comedy films (although they often played characters with different names and occupations) would qualify as their shtick. A comedian might maintain several different shticks of this sort, particularly if appearing in a variety show encouraging development of multiple characters, such as <i><a href=\"/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live\" title=\"Saturday Night Live\">Saturday Night Live</a></i>. \n</p><p>In common usage, the word <i>shtick</i> has also come to mean any talent, style, habit, or other eccentricity for which a person is particularly well-known, even if not intended for comedic purposes. For example, a person who is known locally for an ability to eat dozens of hot dogs quickly might say that it was his shtick. Among <a href=\"/wiki/Orthodox_Judaism\" title=\"Orthodox Judaism\">Orthodox Jews</a>, \"shtick\" can also refer to <a href=\"/wiki/Jewish_wedding#Special_dances\" title=\"Jewish wedding\">wedding shtick</a>, in which wedding guests entertain the bride and groom through dancing, costumes, juggling, and silliness.\n</p><p>Because of its roots in show business, <i>shtick</i> has taken on connotation of a contrived and often used act. For this reason, journalists and commentators often apply the word disparagingly to stock replies from politicians.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Notable_examples\">Notable examples</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Shtick&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Notable examples\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Jack_Benny\" title=\"Jack Benny\">Jack Benny</a>'s character on his radio program was notoriously both stingy and a bad violin player, as well as being perpetually 39 years old.
