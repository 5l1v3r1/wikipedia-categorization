Eardrum Records was a record label owned by American comedian and actor George Carlin.  Carlin formed the label in 1986. He then bought out Little David Records, the label that previously released his material.  Eardrum was distributed by Atlantic Records, which had also distributed Little David, and Carlin was the sole artist on the label until his death.  Eardrum released all of Carlin's later recordings starting with Playinâ€™ with Your Head in 1986 and also remastered and reissued Carlin's classic Little David albums on compact disc.
