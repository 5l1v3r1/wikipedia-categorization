Stand Up! Records is an American independent comedy record label founded in Minneapolis, Minnesota, by former -ismist Recordings label head Dan Schlissel. Schlissel had released around 70 records with -ismist when his most promising act, Slipknot, dumped the label.  The first act was signed to Stand Up! shortly afterwards, Lewis Black in 1999.  All releases from 2000 and 2001 were originally issued by -ismist Recordings, the predecessor to Stand Up! Records.  When the titles were repressed, starting in early 2002, the branding was switched to the Stand Up! Records imprint.  All titles from 2002 onward were originally issued by Stand Up! Records, unless under license from another label, or bringing an out of print release back into print.
