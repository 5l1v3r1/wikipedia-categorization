Commedia dell'arte began in the 16th century.  When it began it was performed outside in piazzas,  in theatres,    and in public meeting halls and courts.   With indoor stages there were several to choose from. With the rise in popularity of commedia also came the rise in theatre technology.  This new technology was not always available to all commedia troops, but when it was they often took advantage of it.  Also with the rise in popularity, communities made ways to aid these troupes. Private homes were converted as well as town halls.  When the troupes went to Europe they used what theatres they could find and would also try and build new ones to continue aiding the art.  Out door stages were utilized by dramatizing their daily lives. Where merchants had to try and get the peoples attention from the stage.   They often had a backdrop to show a general location.  Some scholars debate weather or not these troupes were the worst of all.  This could have played a part in deterring people from performing in the street due to this stigma.  This stigma grew so much that Isabella Andreini to write to the Governor of Milan complaining about them.  The earliest knowledge that we have is when Ferdinand, a son of the Duke of Bavaria, Albrecht V, went to Florence for a wedding.
