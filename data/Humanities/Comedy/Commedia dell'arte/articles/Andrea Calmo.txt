Andrea Calmo (1510 in Venice â€“ 1571) was an Italian actor and author (dramatist) of Commedia dell'Arte, and one of the pioneers of this type of masked theater, as created for the 16th century Venetian audience. His six comedies are Las Spagnolas (1549), La Saltuzza (1551),  La Fiorina (1552), La Pozione (1552), La Rodiana (1553), and il Travaglio (1556). He also published a number of eclogues. All these works were typically in rhyme. Calmo also corresponded with a number of important artists including Anton Francesco Doni, Pietro Aretino, and Tintoretto, and discussed art and scenography.
