The Accademia Filodrammatica di Milano was in fact a theater company, but its theater building, designed by Polak and Canonica, promoted republican ideas, which by then were ascendant. It favored a natural equality for an audience, substituting private boxes with galleries.  His colleagues in the theater circuit were Vincènzo Monti, Carlo Porta, and others. He also helped foster the careers of Francesco Righetti and Giuditta Pasta. The theater employed Andrea Appiani as a scenographer.
