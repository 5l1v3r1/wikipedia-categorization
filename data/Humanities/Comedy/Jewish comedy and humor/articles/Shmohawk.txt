Shmohawk or schmohawk is a slang term that might have derived from schmo, a slang term meaning fool.  The HBO television show Curb Your Enthusiasm gave the word recent notoriety. Earlier uses of the word can be found in the Crusader Rabbit animated cartoon "Crusader and the Schmohawk Indians", released in 1950  and in Saul Bellow's 1958 novel Henderson the Rain King. Shmohawk or schmohawk is the word mohawk with the prefix shm-. In English, this prefix has a mocking or dismissive meaning. The shm- prefix's English language meaning is borrowed from the Yiddish language, in which the prefix has been used to similar effect.  Notes
