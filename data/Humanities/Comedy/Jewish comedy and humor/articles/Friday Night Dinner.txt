  Friday Night Dinner is a British television sitcom written by Robert Popper and starring Tamsin Greig, Paul Ritter, Simon Bird, Tom Rosenthal and Mark Heap.  The comedy is focused on the regular dinner experience of a British Jewish family (the Goodmans) every Friday night. It began airing on 25 February 2011 on Channel 4. The fifth series concluded on 8 June 2018.  Friday Night Dinner depicts Shabbat dinner in the middle-class secular Jewish Goodman family, reflecting writer and producer Robert Popper's own secular Jewish upbringing.  It is set in suburban North London, and filmed there, in Mill Hill.  The family consists of father Martin (Paul Ritter), mother Jackie (Tamsin Greig), elder son and musician Adam (Simon Bird), and younger son and estate agent Jonny (Tom Rosenthal). The stories follow the family as they have their dinner, which is often interrupted by Adam and Jonny pranking each other, and by their strange, lonely, friendless next-door neighbour Jim (Mark Heap), who is sexually attracted to Jackie and is terrified of his own dog Wilson. Jackie's best friend Val is also a frequent visitor. There are strong elements of farce throughout. The following is a list of series regulars from Friday Night Dinner, with actors credited in order that they were first credited in the series. In September 2011, Deadline Hollywood announced that Greg Daniels, who had adapted The Office for American television, would spearhead an American remake of the series for the broadcast network NBC.  The remake was picked up for a pilot, written by Daniels and directed by Ken Kwapis  and starring Allison Janney and Tony Shalhoub as the mother and father.  The pilot did not go to series.
