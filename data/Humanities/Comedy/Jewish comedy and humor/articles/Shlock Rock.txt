Shlock Rock is an American-Israeli Jewish rock band, put together in December 1985, and officially founded in 1986, and led by, singer Lenny Solomon,  which parodies popular secular songs, substituting new, religious-themed lyrics for the music. To date they have released 36 albums.  Shlock Rock continues to record albums and perform live as of 2015, and to date has sold more than 200,000 CD’s, tapes and DVDs in the contemporary Jewish rock arena. Their music is a mix of pop-rock song parodies and original rock songs in English and Hebrew. The purpose of the band is to spread Jewish pride, identity and awareness throughout the Jewish community, for Jewish continuity. Solomon and Shlock Rock tour around the world, playing at concerts, schools, and Jewish events.  They are the only Jewish Music band to play a concert in all 50 States. According to Solomon, in December 1985, Lenny and the band "rented the 39th Street Music studio in New York for two weeks from midnight to 8:00am as it was the only time slot they could afford."  Their first album was under the name "Schlock Rock"  and titled "Learning is Good".  It was released in January 1986.  The original Shlock Rock band consisted of Lenny Solomon (keyboards, vocals), Yonah Lloyd (guitar), Gary Wallin (drums), Mark Skier (bass), Mark Infield (saxophone, keyboards, percussion), and Danny Block (saxophone, violin).  It has since gone on to include the "Jewish Rapper" Etan G, as well as Roy Weinberger on drums, Mo Shapiro on guitar and Rami Strosberg on saxophone. On tour, the band uses local musicians, except for Solomon and Etan G.  In March 2009, Shlock Rock released their 31st album “No Limits” online. It was offered in a pay-what-you-want format at a minimum download price of $1 for the twelve-song album. Customers who paid the retail price ($15), or more, also received the CD upon its release on December 2009. The album was recorded in Haworth, New Jersey.  "I wrote twelve songs in four days from my house in Israel," Solomon stated, "I love these songs and want everyone to have them." The offer ran until March 28 (Passover of that year).   The band released its official video for "Another Door Opens" from the album in July.  In 2011, the band released Shabbat in Liverpool, "adapting Shabbat services to the tunes of Lennon and McCartney."  Shlock Rock parodies popular secular songs, substituting new, Jewish religious-themed lyrics for the originals, and is "best known for songs that educate and entertain through parody."   Hit songs include "We Have a Strong Desire" (sung to the tune of Billy Joel's "We Didn't Start the Fire"),   "Abarbanel" (sung to the tune of The Beach Boys' "Barbara Ann"), "Achashverosh" (sung to the tune of Falco's "Rock Me Amadeus"" (the Salieri Club Mix), and "My Bekeshe Needs Cleaning" (sung to the tune of The Mamas & the Papas' "California Dreamin'").
