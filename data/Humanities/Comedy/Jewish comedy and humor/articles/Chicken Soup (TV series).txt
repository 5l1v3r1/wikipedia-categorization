Chicken Soup is an American sitcom starring Jackie Mason and Lynn Redgrave that aired on ABC from September 12 to November 7, 1989. The series focuses on the interfaith relationship of a middle-aged Jewish man, Jackie (Mason), and an Irish Catholic woman, Maddie (Redgrave). Episodes centered around humorous situations and obstacles caused by the couple's different religions. Chicken Soup was scheduled after the number one primetime series Roseanne,  but was canceled because it could not hold a large enough percentage of the audience from its lead-in and because of controversy over inflammatory remarks by Mason during the New York City Mayoral elections.
