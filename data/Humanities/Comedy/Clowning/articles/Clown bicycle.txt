A clown bicycle or clown bike is a bicycle designed for comedic visual effect or stunt riding, typically by circus clowns.  It is sometimes called a circus bike.  Some clown bikes are also fixed gear, with no freewheeling, so that they may be pedaled either forward or backwards. Some are built very small but are otherwise relatively normal. Pedaling an extremely small bicycle is very difficult and usually much slower than walking, so there is little practical advantage to having a bicycle that will fit in one's purse or pocket.
