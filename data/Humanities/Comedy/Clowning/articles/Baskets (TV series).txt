The series was co-created by Louis C.K., Zach Galifianakis and Jonathan Krisel; Krisel is also the showrunner and director. Galifianakis stars in the dual lead role as Chip Baskets, a failed professional clown in Paris, who instead becomes a local rodeo clown in Bakersfield, California and his twin brother Dale Baskets. Galifianakis, C.K., M. Blair Breard, Dave Becky, Marc Gurvitz and Andrea Pett-Joseph serve as executive producers, with FX Productions as the production company. C.K.'s Pig Newton productions had all ties to the show and FX cut after C.K. admitted to sexual harassment toward several women.

With hopes and dreams, Chip Baskets aims to become a professional clown. After failing to get a degree at a prestigious clowning school in Paris, he is stuck with a job at a local rodeo in his hometown of Bakersfield, California. In December 2013, Louis C.K.'s production company, Pig Newton, signed a deal with FX for him to create new shows for their various networks. FX ordered a pilot episode for Baskets with C.K. and Galifianakis to co-write, and Galifianakis to star.  On August 27, 2014, FX picked up the show for a 10-episode first season with production to commence in 2015.  In November 2017, after Louis C.K. confirmed the sexual misconduct allegations against him were true, FX canceled their overall deal with C.K. and his production company, Pig Newton. C.K. will have no involvement in future seasons of the series.  Baskets has received positive reviews from critics.
