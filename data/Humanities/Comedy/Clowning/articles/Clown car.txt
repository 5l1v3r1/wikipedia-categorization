A clown car is a prop in a circus clown routine.  A common example of such a routine involves an implausibly large number of clowns emerging from a very small car, to humorous effect.  The first performance of this routine was in the Cole Bros. Circus during the 1950s.  The clown car is frequently used as a comedic gag in film.   One is featured prominently in Mel Brooks' remake of To Be or Not To Be. They have also been used to describe political contests with a large number of candidates.
