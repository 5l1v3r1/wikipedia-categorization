Fantadroms is a Latvian children's cartoon by the production company Studio Dauka. It first aired in the Soviet Union in 1985. The show has no dialogue and drama unfolds through pantomime and expressive noises such as grunts, groans, and laughter. This allows the show to cross language barriers.  The episode "Salt" won the Lielais Kristaps award for best animation in 1985,  and further episodes were made sporadically until 1995. In the early 1990s, Streamline Pictures was planning to release Fantadroms in the United States, but it was scrapped because the company thought the series was too bizarre for American audiences and that the person representing it did not actually had the rights to it.  The eponymous hero of the show is a yellow shape shifting robot called Indrikis, who usually takes the form of  a cat. He flies through the universe mediating various disputes between the other characters. One recurring dynamic in the show is the love triangle between Indrikis, Receklite; the flying purple cat-octopus with whom he is in love with, and the rat â€“ who is in love with him. Other recurring characters include a cow, a (human) woman, and an amorphous pink blob.
