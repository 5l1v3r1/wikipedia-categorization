His first break was in a television advertisement for ESB Electric Ireland in the 1970s. In the 1990s, RTÃ‰ gave him his big break hosting prime time quiz show Talk About for 3 years.  Alan is also known as Sammy Sausages, a hugely popular character in The Cheerios Panto which has been an annual smash hit since 1988. In 2009, Hughes faced a health scare when there were fears he had stomach cancer.  In September 2011, Hughes engaged in a civil partnership with his partner of 18 years, Karl Broderick, a songwriter, at the Unitarian Church in St Stephen's Green, Dublin.   The wedding, on the 18th anniversary of their meeting, was described by The Irish Times as the highest profile wedding since legislation permitting it to take place was brought in.  Close friend Derek Mooney was his best man.  The couple appeared on The Saturday Night Show soon afterwards in their first public interview together.  Hughes was nominated in the Favourite Male TV Presenter category at the 2009 TV Now Awards.
