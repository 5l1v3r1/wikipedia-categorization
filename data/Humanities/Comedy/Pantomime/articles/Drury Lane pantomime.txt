Drury Lane pantomime is a long tradition at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, dating from the early 18th century. In every Christmas season, a pantomime is produced which has a leading place among the many other pantomimes of the capital. Other pantomimes are sometimes produced during the rest of the year. The first English pantomime was Tavern Bilkers performed at Drury Lane in 1702.   This started a popular tradition in which the annual Christmas pantomime at Drury Lane was the foremost entertainment of this kind.  The thirty seven pantomimes in the years 1852 to 1888 were all written by E.L. Blanchard.  From 1893 to 1923, most of the music for the Drury Lane pantomimes was arranged by Jimmy Glover (1861â€“1931), Director of Music .
