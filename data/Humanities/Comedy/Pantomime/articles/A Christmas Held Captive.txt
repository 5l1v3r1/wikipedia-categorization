It is Christmas Eve and Constable Scrooge has impounded Santa's sleigh. Without the sleigh, Santa Claus can't deliver Christmas presents and the children of the world will be disappointed.  Scrooge admits that he impounded the sleigh, then swallows the key to the impound yard where the sleigh is being kept.  Mrs. Santa explains to Sugar Plum Fairy that she the reason Constable Scrooge had become so bitter was that she had once rejected Constable Scrooge's romantic gestures and married Santa instead.  Now, a love spurned Scrooge has decided to seek revenge upon Santa and Mrs. Claus by ruining Christmas for everyone.  The Little Drummer Boy concocts an elaborate plan to save Christmas, forcing Scrooge to spit up the key.  The Elves, Sugar Plum, Mrs. Santa and the Drummer Boy succeed in getting the key back and Christmas is saved.  A defeated Scrooge confesses that he never gets presents at Christmas.  Santa gives Scrooge a present and his spirits are lifted.  The story roughly follows the structure and style of classic British pantomime.
