  BACCES is a non-profit charitable organisation which  was originally set up in 1970 by two British European Airways (BEA) stewards who wrote a comedy review and staged it at York House, Twickenham, UK for two nights. It was so popular that it ran for a further three sell out nights at Chiswick Town Hall. The national press heard of this venture and prompted "Jak" of the Evening Standard to publish a cartoon lampooning the efforts of the cabin crew. Since then the company have been producing reviews and after 1978 a pantomime in aid of national and local charities, which have met with considerable success. The company writes, directs and produces the whole show with very little help from outside sources. In 2011 it was announced that the company had made Â£1 million for their nominated charities in the 40 years it had been performing. In 2008 BACCES won the Flame Award for Inspirational Excellence in Theatre from the National Operatic and Dramatic Association for their 2007 production of Cinderella From 1979 to 1985 the show was performed at the Planet Theatre, Slough. From 1987 to 2014 it was performed at the Beck Theatre, Hayes, Middlesex. From January 2016 the pantomime will be performed at Watford Palace Theatre The next production will be Robin Hood and will take place at the Beck Theatre, Hayes for a week in December 2017.
