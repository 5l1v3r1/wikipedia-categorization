Séverin Cafferra, known as Séverin or mime Séverin  (1863-1930), was one of the best-known French Pierrots or mime artists around the turn of the twentieth century. Caffera was born in Ajaccio, Corsica. He studied under the Marseille mime Louis Rouffe (1849-1885), who in turn had studied under Charles Deburau. He worked at Marseilles, then at the Théatre des Funambules in Paris.  In his 1929 book, L'Homme Blanc : souvenirs d'un Pierrot, Caffera describes Rouffe as having created a complete language of gesture.
