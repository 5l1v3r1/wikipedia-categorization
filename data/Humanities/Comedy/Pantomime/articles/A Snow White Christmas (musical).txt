A Snow White Christmas is a pantomime version of the fairytale Snow White, with a book by Kris Lythgoe and a score consisting of a pastiche of well-known pop tunes. It was first produced in 2011 at the El Portal Theatre in North Hollywood, California.  The music includes songs by Katy Perry, Bruno Mars, Michael Jackson, The Village People, Britney Spears, Lady Gaga and Hall and Oats, among others. Like other pantomime-style musicals, the show includes magic, dancing, singing, acting, audience interactivity and sing-a-long segments.  The story follows the traditional Snow White fairytale with some additional characters. Muddles is the court jester to the Queen and is Snow White's best friend.  As in other pantomimes, the 4th wall is broken by the actors, who encourage the audience to cheer for Snow White and Boo the Wicked Queen.
