Pantomime comics or a silent comic are comics which are delivered in mime. They make use of little to no dialogue, speech balloons or captions written underneath the images. Instead the stories or gags are told entirely through pictures.  Pantomime comics have the advantage of being easily understandable to people - like children - who are slow readers. The genre is also universally popular since translation is not required, lacking the usual language barriers. Sergio Aragonés, a famous artist in the field, once said in a 1991 interview with Comics Journal: "What happens is like a supersimplification. “Something you can say with words, you have to eliminate all the words until it can be told in a little story without words.  You just think a little longer.  But it becomes rewarding in the end because everybody can understand your cartoons no matter what your nationality.  And that, to me, has been always a big thing—to do cartoons that everybody can understand, every age, every nationality.  It is different.  It’s like in the theater.  You have regular theater, and you have pantomime, like Marcel Marceau or Alejandro Jodorowsky. And I apply that to cartooning and it works.".  Pantomime comics tend to be popular in the gag-a-day comics genre, where they typically only exist of just three or four images per episode. But some graphic novels with longer narratives also make use of pantomime. This allows for a more visual experience, where the actual meaning of the events is left to the readers' own interpretation. Some famous pantomime comics artists are Sergio Aragonés,  Guy Bara,  Chaval,  Henning Dahl Mikkelsen,  Adolf Oberländer,  Wil Raymakers,  Otto Soglow  , Gluyas Williams   and Jim Woodring.
