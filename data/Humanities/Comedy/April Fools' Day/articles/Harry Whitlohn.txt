Sir Harry Whitlohn was a fictitious character who appeared as a "castaway" on the BBC Radio programme Desert Island Discs on 1 April 1963 - April Fools' Day.   He was variously presented as a "man of affairs, musician, mountaineer, and mystic", an "88-year-old mountaineer, mystic and spy" and "the only man living who had collaborated with Brahms".
