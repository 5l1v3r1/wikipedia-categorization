Homer Brown is a character in the radio sitcom The Aldrich Family. A good friend of Henry Aldrich, Homer Brown attends Centreville High, the same high school that Henry goes to. Considered somewhat of a dim-wit, Homer is nervous and a food lover. However, he is also fairly dependable, and helps Henry whenever there's a predicament. One of the show's later characters, Homer was played by Jack Kelk, and in the final season was played by John Fiedler (who would go on to a well known role as the voice of Piglet in Winnie-the-Pooh), Michael O'Day, and Jack Grimes.
