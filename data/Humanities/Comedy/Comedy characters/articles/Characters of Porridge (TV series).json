Unlike <a href=\"/wiki/Mr_Mackay\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Mr Mackay\">Mr Mackay</a>, whose harsh and confrontational methods he disapproves of (though he dare not make this known to Mr Mackay), Barrowclough is a timid, sympathetic man who firmly believes that the role of prison is to <a href=\"/wiki/Rehabilitation_(penology)\" title=\"Rehabilitation (penology)\">rehabilitate</a> rather than punish. He does not share Mackay's tough military background, having done his <a href=\"/wiki/National_Service\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"National Service\">National Service</a> in <a href=\"/wiki/Royal_Air_Force\" title=\"Royal Air Force\">Royal Air Force</a> stores in the comfortable surroundings of <a href=\"/wiki/Singapore\" title=\"Singapore\">Singapore</a>. \n</p><p>Mr Barrowclough does not seem to be cut out for the life of a prison warden, and he says in the movie version whilst in conversation with a new officer that Slade prison is a miserable place and that the only reason he stays is that its either this or being at home with the wife. <a href=\"/wiki/Norman_Stanley_Fletcher\" title=\"Norman Stanley Fletcher\">Fletcher</a> and the other prisoners constantly abuse his leniency to acquire more pleasant jobs, cells or special privileges. They also know how to forge his signature. However, despite this, the prisoners do hold a great deal of fondness for Barrowclough. At one point, in an attempt to raise his prestige due to the vicious nature of Mr. Wainwright, the (temporary) replacement of Mackay, they stage a riot, refusing to stop for even the harshest of threats, including Wainwright himself. But when, on Fletch's suggestion, Barrowclough is called into the hall, they fall silent as he nervously enters, and do not hesitate in obeying his rather timid requests, such as 'now, why don't you all put those things down...' and 'in the meantime, why don't we all file back to our cells in a nice, orderly fashion...?'\n</p><p>However nervous his job makes Mr Barrowclough, it is nothing compared to the fear he has of his often mentioned but <a href=\"/wiki/Unseen_character\" title=\"Unseen character\">never seen</a> wife, Alice. It is partly because of Fletcher's advice on dealing with his wife that Barrowclough is especially lenient when dealing with his requests and misdemeanours.

In an effort to get her a gift, Godber broke into a neighbour's flat. He was caught, and it was for this that he was sentenced to two years' imprisonment. Denise later broke up with Godber through a <a href=\"/wiki/Dear_John_letter\" title=\"Dear John letter\">Dear John letter</a>.\n</p><p>Godber often came into conflict with the ever suspicious Mr Mackay, who appeared to find it very hard to believe that Lennie was not up to something. Even when he was, MacKay found it very hard to pin anything on him, thanks to Godber's penchant for dramatics, and occasionally to the cover-up efforts of Fletch and the sympathetic Mr. Barrowclough. Godber works in the prison kitchen where he has ample opportunities to steal valuable commodities such as butter and pineapple chunks that Fletcher is fond of. Godber also briefly took up a career as a boxer in the prison, although this was short-lived when he became involved in match fixing.\n</p><p>Godber appears in all but four episodes of Porridge.

Eventually, Fletcher reveals the tunnel that was dug to Mr. Mackay but ends up landing himself in the prison infirmary. After Mackay offers him a bottle of whisky in exchange for information, Fletcher tells him that they disposed of the soil from the tunnel by burying it in a second one.\n</p><p>In the 2003 <a href=\"/wiki/Mockumentary\" title=\"Mockumentary\">mockumentary</a> <i><a href=\"/wiki/Life_Beyond_the_Box:_Norman_Stanley_Fletcher\" title=\"Life Beyond the Box: Norman Stanley Fletcher\">Life Beyond The Box: Norman Stanley Fletcher</a></i>, it is revealed that after being released from prison Grouty continued running his \"business empire\" (although he insisted it was now straight, and no-one could prove otherwise), and also became a \"celebrity criminal\", in a similar manner to <a href=\"/wiki/Frankie_Fraser\" title=\"Frankie Fraser\">Frankie Fraser</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Kray_twins\" title=\"Kray twins\">The Krays</a>.

The circumstances that brought him to be in prison are unknown although in one episode - The Porridge Christmas Special, \"No Way Out\" - he successfully relieved Mr Barrowclough of his watch, in a manner strongly suggestive of a skilled pickpocket. He is openly gay, and his partner Trevor is a watch repairer from <a href=\"/wiki/Southport\" title=\"Southport\">Southport</a>; Trevor appears in the episode \"Men Without Women\". Lukewarm shared a cell with the elderly Blanco, over whom he would fuss a lot, especially when Blanco was due to face the parole board. Blanco did concede that, for all his fussing, Lukewarm did keep the cell nice and clean. Lukewarm is often seen knitting.\n</p><p>Although he is a trusted friend and confidant of Fletcher's, he seldom becomes directly involved in his schemes, preferring instead to spend his association time observing the latest goings-on whilst busying himself with his latest knitting projects. He works in the kitchens alongside Godber and is an enthusiastic if notoriously untalented cook (although it was said that he did make good pasties).\n</p><p>Lukewarm was released three months prior to Fletcher in <i>Going Straight</i>. Fletcher mentions to McLaren that he received a letter from Lukewarm, stating his case is coming up after he was accused of stealing a woman's handbag, which he claimed was his own.\n</p><p>In the <a href=\"/wiki/Mockumentary\" title=\"Mockumentary\">mockumentary</a> \"Life Beyond The Box: Norman Stanley Fletcher\", his real name is revealed as being Timothy Underwood, although in <i>Just Desserts</i> he appears to be addressed by a warden as Lewis.

McLaren, who claims to have been adopted, is a black man from <a href=\"/wiki/Greenock\" title=\"Greenock\">Greenock</a>, Scotland. This led to a string of racist abuse when he first arrived at Slade Prison. Fletcher, in reference to his Scottish upbringing, frequently calls him \"Jock\". Upon arrival, he was an angry young man, and it was left up to Fletcher to calm him down and to curb the abuse he received. A keen football player, he was soon turning out every Saturday afternoon for the inter-wing football matches. He supports <a href=\"/wiki/Greenock_Morton_F.C.\" title=\"Greenock Morton F.C.\">Greenock Morton</a>.\n</p><p>Along with Godber and Warren, McLaren is a regular conspirator with Fletcher.

Mackay is a neurotic and tough prison warder whose constant obsession in life is to catch Fletcher out. Mackay has the authority to make decisions affecting the entire wing, such as banning Christmas celebrations in the episode <i>No Way Out</i>, so is presumably the wing Custodial Manager. Fletch's sly tactics in misdeeds ranging from fixing boxing matches, stealing pills from the prison doctor and eggs from the prison farmyard right through to finding new and imaginative ways to stick two fingers up at Mackay and get away with it, were specially designed to get up Mackay's nose. In return, Mackay's frenzied attempts to catch Fletch out, when fruitful, gave Mackay a level of smugness and satisfaction which was only accentuated by Fletch's hostility and skulking. Born into a poor family, Mackay went on to be a drill sergeant (though in <i>Going Straight</i> this is changed to Warrant Officer Class 2) in the <a href=\"/wiki/Argyll_and_Sutherland_Highlanders\" title=\"Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders\">Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders</a> and ran a boarding house in <a href=\"/wiki/Peebles\" title=\"Peebles\">Peebles</a> with his wife, Marie, before joining the prison service. Mackay's temper is agitated by the constant suspicion he has of Fletcher, and his despair at the leniency of his other polar opposite in the series - his optimistic, mild-mannered, kind-hearted prison officer colleague Mr Barrowclough. Mackay's homeland of Scotland serves as a constant source of entertainment for Fletcher who is always on the lookout for an opportunity to antagonise Mackay. In one episode Mackay asks Fletcher whether he felt he was working class. Fletcher responds 'I did, until I visited <a href=\"/wiki/Glasgow\" title=\"Glasgow\">Glasgow</a>. Now I think I'm middle class.'\n</p><p>Mackay appears in the first episode of <i>Going Straight</i>, where it is revealed he has left Slade Prison after reaching compulsory retirement age for prison officers.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Medals\">Medals</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Characters_of_Porridge_(TV_series)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Medals\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>During the series Mackay regularly wore his army service ribbons on his uniform.

Blanco's response is an oft-repeated comedy moment:\n</p><p><i>\"No. I know 'im wot did it. It were the wife's lover. But don't worry, I shan't go round searching for him, 'e died years ago. That I do know. It were me that killed him!\".</i>\n</p><p>Despite Blanco being an elderly character, David Jason was in his mid-30s when he played Blanco.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\"
