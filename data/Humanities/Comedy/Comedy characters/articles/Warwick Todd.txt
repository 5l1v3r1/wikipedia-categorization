Warwick Todd is a fictional character created by author and comedian Tom Gleisner. Todd is the author of four fictional cricket diaries: The Warwick Todd Diaries (1997), Warwick Todd: Back in the Baggy Green (1998), Warwick Todd Goes the Tonk (2001) and Warwick Todd - Up in the Block Hole (2009). The first 3 books in the series were Australian bestsellers. The diaries, recounting Todd's experiences as a member of the Australian cricket team, are a humorous parody of the tour diaries and cricketing memoirs that are a staple of the Australian publishing industry. In contrast to Billy Birmingham's The Twelfth Man, Todd's diaries describe real-life matches played by the Australian cricket team, albeit including Todd as a player. Off-field behaviour, however, is completely fictional and quite at odds with the team's public image. In keeping with the "blokey" style of many tour diaries, Todd refers to all players and support staff by their nicknames and not their real names (for example, "Pigeon" is Glenn McGrath and "Dizzy" is Jason Gillespie). Gleisner has made live appearances as Warwick Todd for charity cricket matches.
