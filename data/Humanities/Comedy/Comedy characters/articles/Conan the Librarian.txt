Conan the Librarian is a common and perennial parody of Robert E. Howard's Conan the Barbarian that has become a literary trope, and has appeared in various media, including film, radio, television, comics, and fan fiction. Based on the similarity in the sound of the word "librarian" to "barbarian," and their near opposite meanings, the phrase is an obvious parodic coinage, and its origins and recurrence are likely due to both independent invention and imitation. This listing is not exhaustive.
