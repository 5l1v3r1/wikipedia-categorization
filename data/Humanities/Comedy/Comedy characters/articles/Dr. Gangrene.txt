Dr. Gangrene is an award-winning television horror host based in the Middle Tennessee area, played by actor/writer Larry Underwood. Underwood was inspired to create the character as an homage to Sir Cecil Creape, a former Nashville horror host. Created in 1999, the show was originally a half hour Public-access television cable TV program called Chiller Cinema in Hendersonville, Tennessee. The first episode aired July 1, 1999 on the Hendersonville, TN Public-access television station. The show quickly expanded into Nashville, Tennessee where it aired on Community Access Channel 19. Chiller Cinema was the first program to broadcast live out of the new Public, educational, and government access television building where CH 19 broadcast from. Chiller Cinema was soon seen on other Public-access television stations across the country, making Underwood one of the first horror hosts to self-syndicate his program. The show moved to Nashville's WB affiliate WNAB in 2005, and was renamed The WB58 Creature Feature, expanding to a two-hour format showing horror and Sci-Fi movies. Underwood later changed the name slightly to The CW58 Creature Feature to match WNAB's switchover from The WB to The CW in September 2006.
