Mudbone is a recurring character in Richard Pryor's stand-up shows. Debuting on the 1975 album ...Is It Something I Said?, Mudbone is easily Pryor's most famous creation.  A wino philosopher born in Tupelo, Mississippi,  his character was an alter-ego for Pryor.  During Pryor's concert film, Richard Pryor: Live on the Sunset Strip, the audience begins to yell "Do Mudbone!" and Pryor reluctantly resurrects the character.
