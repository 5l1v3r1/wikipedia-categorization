Described by <a href=\"/wiki/John_Betjeman\" title=\"John Betjeman\">John Betjeman</a> as \"this decent man from the suburbs\", Stone is one of Humphries' more enduring characters.\n</p><p>The inspiration for Sandy came from a neighbour, a Mr Whittle, whom Humphries knew as a boy, and was portrayed in a short story, <i>Sandy Stone's Big Week</i>, written by Humphries (under the <a href=\"/wiki/Pseudonym\" title=\"Pseudonym\">pseudonym</a> H. Grahame) in 1956 but not published until 1958 (in a Canberra student magazine <i>Prometheus</i>). Humphries describes Sandy, originally called Dusty, as an \"elderly, childless man\" living in the suburbs of Melbourne. His vocal mannerisms came from an old codger Humphries met on <a href=\"/wiki/Bondi_Beach\" title=\"Bondi Beach\">Bondi Beach</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>One of Sandy's monologues was part of the recording <i>A Nice Night's Entertainment</i>, which was particularly enjoyed by Humphries' friend, <a href=\"/wiki/Peter_Cook\" title=\"Peter Cook\">Peter Cook</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> Humphries is still writing monologues for Sandy Stone \"Australia\u2019s most boring man\". He said in 2016 that \"slowly the character has deepened, so I begin to understand and appreciate him, and finally feel myself turning into him\". He no longer requires makeup for the part, and plays Sandy in his own dressing gown.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>   \n</p><p>Sandy's monologues were sometimes inspired by stories recounted to Humphries by friends or family, like the tale of Dot Swift who was handed over to the Twilight Home <sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> which may be the very same home, or perhaps a subsidiary of the one Dame Edna's mother resides in. Barry Humphries sometimes used the character to balance pathos with humor or satire: in one monologue having the ghost of Sandy Stone recall his four-year-old daughter who died in the 1930s and how his wife then suffered a breakdown. The Australian columnist <a href=\"/wiki/Peter_Craven_(literary_critic)\" title=\"Peter Craven (literary critic)\">Peter Craven</a> commented that Humphries in his Sandy Stone persona could \"reduce an audience of young unbelieving cynics to tears with material that might have been written by James Joyce - delivered with wan, uncomprehending wonderment\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The character is featured in the track <i>Sandy Agonistes</i> on Humphries' comedy recording <i>Moonee Ponds Muse, Vol. 1</i>\n</p><p>The complete scripts (edited by Colin O'Brien) of all the Stone <a href=\"/wiki/Soliloquies\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Soliloquies\">soliloquies</a> were published in <i>The Life and Death of Sandy Stone</i> in 1990.\n</p><p>The artist <a href=\"/wiki/Sidney_Nolan\" title=\"Sidney Nolan\">Sidney Nolan</a> painted a portrait of the character.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Sandy_Stone_(character)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Humphries, B:\"My Life as Me\", page 234.
