class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>George was born in the mid-forties to parents Albert (or Arnold/Arthur) and Edna May Mole. He was the elder brother to Susan Mole, his sister, who married a woman called Amanda and works in Holloway Prison.\n</p><p>He fell in love with his future wife, <a href=\"/wiki/Pauline_Mole\" title=\"Pauline Mole\">Pauline Sugden</a>, and they married, having a son, <a href=\"/wiki/Adrian_Mole\" title=\"Adrian Mole\">Adrian</a>. Pauline rejected their child for a year, leaving George to look after him, something Adrian never knew until his teenage years. George took a job selling electrical storage heaters, but he is later made <a href=\"/wiki/Layoff\" title=\"Layoff\">redundant</a>; he later finds re-employment maintaining the banks of the local <a href=\"/wiki/Canal\" title=\"Canal\">canal</a>. George, Pauline and Adrian lived together at their house on Wisteria Walk, <a href=\"/wiki/Ashby-de-la-Zouch\" title=\"Ashby-de-la-Zouch\">Ashby-de-la-Zouch</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Leicestershire\" title=\"Leicestershire\">Leicestershire</a>.\n</p><p>However, he and Pauline had several marital issues, and they both left each other for different people on various occasions. Pauline left George for insurance salesman <a href=\"#Alan_Lucas\">Alan Lucas</a> in the early 1980s, but later returned (pregnant with <a href=\"/wiki/Rosie_Mole\" title=\"Rosie Mole\">Rosie</a>), telling George that the baby was his. Soon after, George left Pauline for his former colleague <a href=\"#Doreen_Slater\">Doreen Slater</a>, fathering a son, <a href=\"#Brett_Mole\">Brett</a>, with her. This hurt Pauline because Brett was a name that she had wanted to call her child, believing all Bretts were successful in life. Eventually, after months of suspicion, George confessed his affair and secret son to Pauline and Adrian on their family holiday to <a href=\"/wiki/Skegness\" title=\"Skegness\">Skegness</a>; Pauline ordered him to return to Doreen, and then got <a href=\"#Tania_Braithwaite\">Tania Braithwaite</a> to collect them. George, Doreen and Doreen's son, Maxwell, moved in with George's mother. When Maxwell's father, and Doreen's previous boyfriend, <a href=\"#Trevor_Roper\">Trevor Roper</a> returns from there army, Doreen swiftly abandons George for Trevor, leading to George reconciling with Pauline. Happiness did not last, and eventually the Moles got divorced in 1990. Pauline got wed to toyboy lover Martin Muffett, twenty-three years her junior, and George started living with his lover <a href=\"#Belinda_Bellingham\">Belinda Bellingham</a>, owner of a company selling home security systems. These relationships both end sourly - Martin leaves Pauline for Adrian's girlfriend <a href=\"#Bianca_Dartington\">Bianca</a>, and Belinda throws George out when she discovers that he has been selling her product in back-street boozers for half their retail value.\n</p><p>George and Pauline remarry in 1993, and take on primary responsibility for Adrian's son <a href=\"#William_Mole\">William</a>, as Adrian is spending most of the week in <a href=\"/wiki/Soho\" title=\"Soho\">Soho</a>, working at Savage's Restaurant as head chef. This life continues for a while until the <a href=\"/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1997\" title=\"United Kingdom general election, 1997\">general election</a>, when Adrian's childhood sweetheart <a href=\"/wiki/Pandora_Braithwaite\" title=\"Pandora Braithwaite\">Pandora Braithwaite</a> became Ashby-de-la-Zouch's <a href=\"/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)\" title=\"Labour Party (UK)\">Labour</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Member_of_Parliament\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Member of Parliament\">MP</a> in a landslide vote. Pauline, in an initially drunken mistake, had sex with Pandora's father <a href=\"#Ivan_Braithwaite\">Ivan</a> in Ivan and his wife Tania's gazebo. This developed into an affair, until Pauline and Ivan left their spouses for each other. Tania offered George a shoulder to cry on at the Braithwaite homestead, The Lawns, and they began a relationship, successfully bemusing and confusing Adrian, Pandora, Rosie and William. The couples married, but Pauline and Ivan's happiness was cut short when Ivan drowned on his honeymoon. George and Tania continued living at The Lawns, with George helping Tania transform her house when she was undergoing a <a href=\"/wiki/Japan\" title=\"Japan\">Japanese</a> phase, but George falls from a ladder trying to construct a <a href=\"/wiki/Pagoda\" title=\"Pagoda\">pagoda</a>, breaking his spine and suffering deep cuts from all the <a href=\"/wiki/Credit_cards\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Credit cards\">credit cards</a> in his pocket. While staying in hospital, George's spine was mended, but he contracted a <a href=\"/wiki/Superbug\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Superbug\">superbug</a> from some shoddily-cleaned equipment, causing him to be isolated and stay in hospital for upwards of eighteen months. Upon his recovery, Pauline managed to tempt George away from Tania, remarrying for a third and final time. This caused Tania to have a slight breakdown, combined with the loss of Ivan. George and Pauline move from Wisteria Walk to the (fictional) community of Mangold Parva, converting two disused <a href=\"/wiki/Pigsties\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Pigsties\">pigsties</a> into housing for themselves and Adrian's new family - Adrian, his wife <a href=\"#Daisy_Mole\">Daisy</a> and daughter <a href=\"#Gracie_Mole\">Gracie</a>. George quietens down in his later life, although he breaks his back again and is confined to a wheelchair, suffering numerous <a href=\"/wiki/Strokes\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Strokes\">strokes</a>. He does agree to go on <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Jeremy_Kyle_Show\" title=\"The Jeremy Kyle Show\">The Jeremy Kyle Show</a></i> with Pauline, Rosie and Pauline's former lover Alan Lucas, to settle the long-running dispute over Rosie's paternity. When it is proven that Rosie is Lucas's child, George becomes withdrawn, hurt by Rosie's swift rejection of him and making him question if Adrian was his child. He makes amends with Pauline and settles into old age, especially pleased when he discovers that he will become a great-grandfather.\n</p><p>George, like Pauline, is sometimes tactless and inefficient. He has no qualms about showing favouritism for his three children - his favourite was always Rosie, which is why he took it so hard when he discovers Rosie isn't his. He doesn't enjoy talking about his feelings and wants his son to be a 'real man', like a computer technician. One of his less attractive qualities is his openly saying that he married Adrian's mother Pauline because is how good her legs looked in a <a href=\"/wiki/Miniskirt\" title=\"Miniskirt\">miniskirt</a>.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Rosie_Mole\">Rosie Mole</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=List_of_Adrian_Mole_characters&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Rosie Mole\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Rosie_Mole\" title=\"Rosie Mole\">Rosie Mole</a></div>\n<h4><span id=\"Brett_Slater.2FMole\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Brett_Slater/Mole\">Brett Slater/Mole</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=List_of_Adrian_Mole_characters&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Brett Slater/Mole\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p><b>Brett Slater</b>, later <b>Brett Mole</b>, is the result of an affair between <a href=\"/wiki/George_Mole\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"George Mole\">George Mole</a> and Doreen Slater in the early 1980s, meaning he is Adrian's half-brother. Brett, a name his father stole from his then-wife Pauline, has an elder half-brother, Maxwell. The Slater family and George lived for a short time with George's mother Edna and eventually Brett moved with his mother and brother to <a href=\"/wiki/Bournemouth\" title=\"Bournemouth\">Bournemouth</a>. Brett re-enters Adrian's life in 2001, as an <a href=\"/wiki/Oxford_University\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Oxford University\">Oxford</a> undergraduate who as been commissioned by <a href=\"/wiki/Channel_4\" title=\"Channel 4\">Channel 4</a> to shoot a documentary on a council estate, and chose Adrian's site. Brett is everything Adrian ever wanted to be; rich, successful and popular with the ladies. During the short time he stayed with his brother, he became a role model for Adrian's sons Glenn and William and left cables, cameras and crew all over Adrian's house. When the documentary flopped, Brett and his team disappeared within three hours. Brett re-appeared again in <i><a href=\"/wiki/Adrian_Mole:_The_Prostrate_Years\" title=\"Adrian Mole: The Prostrate Years\">The Prostrate Years</a></i> as a successful businessman who lost his empire and three riverside apartments in <a href=\"/wiki/London\" title=\"London\">London</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Tokyo\" title=\"Tokyo\">Tokyo</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/New_York_City\" title=\"New York City\">New York City</a> to the credit crunch. He informs the Mole family that Doreen Slater died in a motorbike accident which, to Adrian, seemed to be a fabricated version of what really happened - there were a few facts that didn't add up. Upon his arrival, Brett proceeded to steal the eyes of Adrian's daughter Gracie, wife Daisy and both Adrian's parents. Brett bought seven-packs of white cotton shirts and threw each one away after only a days wear. Adrian clears up after him, stops his brother's alcoholism and generally sorts him out; Brett lives on with Adrian after getting his life back on track before leaving once again.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Extended_family\">Extended family</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=List_of_Adrian_Mole_characters&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Extended family\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<ul><li><b>Edna May Mole</b>, commonly known as <b>Grandma</b> (22 March 1905 \u2013 1 March 1992), is the paternal grandmother of Adrian and mother of George and Susan. Provider of Sunday dinners, constant electricity and unwanted religion, Edna is a strict, no-nonsense widow, and has lived alone since the death of her husband. She doesn't believe in home security systems; if she goes out she turns up Radio 4 and leaves the door unlocked; and besides, if she fitted one people would think she had something worth stealing. Edna dotes on her grandchild, and will often give him 50p for a <a href=\"/wiki/Mars_Bar\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Mars Bar\">Mars Bar</a>. Edna is well renowned in the family for her wonderful Sunday dinners, and it is remarked that she used the same <a href=\"/wiki/Yorkshire_pudding\" title=\"Yorkshire pudding\">Yorkshire pudding</a> bowl for forty years. She, and her husband, are strongly opposed to their daughter's <a href=\"/wiki/Lesbianism\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Lesbianism\">lesbianism</a>. Edna has a love/hate relationship with her daughter-in-law <a href=\"/wiki/Pauline_Mole\" title=\"Pauline Mole\">Pauline</a> - and, subsequently, her relatives the Sugdens - as Edna disapproves of her wanton behaviour, yet when Pauline and George divorce she still visits her regularly. Edna keeps money in three separate vases: one for gas, electricity and heating. Edna dies during <i><a href=\"/wiki/Adrian_Mole:_The_Wilderness_Years\" title=\"Adrian Mole: The Wilderness Years\">The Wilderness Years</a></i>. Following her death, Pauline shows a momentous outpouring of grief, to the family's surprise.

Adrian mentions that when he was six, a dog bit his arm and his grandmother put iodine on the wound while Albert kicked the dog around the kitchen. Albert was a veteran of both <a href=\"/wiki/World_War_One\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"World War One\">World War I</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/World_War_Two\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"World War Two\">II</a>; alongside mentions of his serving in the <a href=\"/wiki/First_Battle_of_Ypres\" title=\"First Battle of Ypres\">Battle of Ypres</a>, his son George once said \"just the sound of Lilli Marlene and he would be crying. Your Grandma would send him out the room to pull himself together\". He is once described as cold and would tire quickly of his grandson's frequent questions, much to his bewilderment. He, and his wife, are strongly opposed to their daughter's <a href=\"/wiki/Lesbianism\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Lesbianism\">lesbianism</a>. Adrian remembers the family wanting to pay their last respects to Albert in his coffin, but nobody could find the screwdriver to lift the lid off with. He used to work at the factory on Rat Wharf - Adrian later moves into a block of flats standing where the factory used to be.

Susan, a <a href=\"/wiki/Lesbian\" title=\"Lesbian\">lesbian</a>, is first seen dating Gloria, but a reference is later made of her marriage to a woman named Amanda. Susan gave advice to Nigel Hetherington when he was planning to tell his parents that he was <a href=\"/wiki/Gay\" title=\"Gay\">gay</a>; she said \"I just came out with it. 'Mum, I'm gay. Like it or lump it.' Minus the screaming and shouting, it was over in two minutes\", to Nigel's response of \"Oh, how <i>brave</i>!\". Susan always sends Adrian <a href=\"/wiki/Birthday_card\" title=\"Birthday card\">birthday cards</a> which he describes as 'vulgar!' and 'in extremely bad taste'; one example is a Christmas card she sends him with \"the carrot in the wrong place\". Susan has two great-nephews, Glenn and William, and a great-niece, Gracie.

They have never fully understood why Pauline left home, but they see it as their duty to visit her every <a href=\"/wiki/Christmas\" title=\"Christmas\">Christmas</a> and frown upon their daughters sluttish lifestyle. They disapprove of her constant divorces. As of <i><a href=\"/wiki/Adrian_Mole:_The_Cappuccino_Years\" title=\"Adrian Mole: The Cappuccino Years\">The Cappuccino Years</a></i>, they are still alive. Grandad Sugden has a condition that sends him to sleep every twenty minutes, \"but only for ten second or so\" as Grandma Sugden says. They gave their grandson a <i>Bible Stories for Boys</i> for Christmas 1981. They are strict tee-totals who think the only decent part of Christmas is the Queen's speech.

They are described as having faces that look like they visit funerals every day of their lives, so much to the point that Adrian and George can't believe that his mother is related to them. In a letter to Pauline during her separation from George, the Sugdens wrote to inform her that Dennis, Marcia and Maurice have moved out of their caravan and into a council house, and that Cousin Maurice lost a grey sock at the Mole household during his stay at Christmas, much to Auntie Marcia's dismay. Pauline replied that she would gladly come up and inspect their house, and sent them a one-pound note to buy Maurice a new pair of socks. Their relationship to Pauline is unclear; Pauline refers to them as 'Auntie' and 'Uncle', but it is commonly thought that Dennis is Pauline's brother.

Jojo and Adrian's marriage was short, short enough to conceive and produce a child, but Jojo's memories are not exactly happy ones. She claims that Adrian's conversation was far from stimulating, and one conversation that agitated her was when Adrian accused her of exaggerating her sneezes. Jojo complains that exaggerating her sneezes is the last thing she would do, being a six-foot, pregnant black woman in extravagant dress. Jojo later divorces Adrian and leaves for her native homeland of <a href=\"/wiki/Nigeria\" title=\"Nigeria\">Nigeria</a>, with Adrian taking custody of their child. Jojo later marries a Nigerian man who is very successful in business (initially named as Colonel Ephat Mapfumo and later as Wole; it is possible Jojo in fact remarried twice.) Jojo looks up her ex-husband on the internet and <a href=\"/wiki/Fax\" title=\"Fax\">faxes</a> him, complete with the information she found on the internet. much to Adrian's agony. William visits his mother and stepfather in London while they are on their honeymoon. Jojo asks if she can take William back to Nigeria, as William is her eldest child and therefore held in high esteem by her family. Adrian tells her that she cannot, so Jojo goes back to Nigeria without her son. Between the events of <i>The Lost Diaries</i> and <i>Weapons of Mass Destruction</i>, Jojo takes William back to Nigeria, much to the heartache of Adrian, Glenn, Pauline and George. William telephones his father, and asks if he can change his name to Wole, like his stepfather's, to which Adrian reluctantly agrees. Jojo's family background is mixed; her father is a Nigerian chief, her mother the owner of a lorry-driving firm, and at the last count there were 204 members of her immediate family.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Daisy_Mole\">Daisy Mole</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=List_of_Adrian_Mole_characters&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11\" title=\"Edit section: Daisy Mole\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p><b>Daisy Mole</b> (n\u00e9e <b>Flowers</b>) is Adrian's second wife and mother of his daughter, Gracie.

Conchita ran away from Michael and infant Daisy when she found love with a butcher named Arthur and besides, Michael was suffocating her with undying love and presents. Daisy is the half-sister of Poppy and Marigold Flowers. Adrian is briefly engaged to Marigold, and only hears things about Daisy, but finally meets her when the Flowers family and the Mole family get together to discuss their offspring's upcoming marriage. Daisy is introduced as a devil-may-care type with <a href=\"/wiki/Prada\" title=\"Prada\">Prada</a> handbags and looks to spare. She and Adrian click instantly, and Adrian develops feelings for her that he must conceal. He eventually confides in his parents, George and Pauline, and they agree that Daisy is indeed a beauty. Adrian eventually breaks off the engagement, to the anger of Michael and Marigold's mother Netta, and gets engaged to Daisy; the two later marry. They move into the converted pigsty next to George and Pauline, and produce a daughter named Gracie, who enjoys dressing up as various <a href=\"/wiki/Disney\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Disney\">Disney</a> princesses. Daisy, originally thin, was becoming plumper and plumper until she starts eating whole packets of chocolate <a href=\"/wiki/Digestive_biscuit\" title=\"Digestive biscuit\">Digestives</a> a day. Daisy and Adrian's marriage becomes boring, and Daisy finds comfort with Mangold Parva's local aristocrat, Hugo Fairfax-Lycett, and Daisy moves into the Fairfax-Lycett mansion, just down the road from her and Adrian's house. Pauline laments the loss of Daisy, saying that Daisy was the daughter she deserved. Adrian and Daisy later divorce, with Daisy and Hugo gaining main custody of Gracie.

Regardless of this, Sharon's mother insists that Adrian sends Sharon some money every week to help her get by. However, blood tests prove that Adrian is indeed Glenn's father. Glenn and Adrian meet for the first time on Father's Day 1998, causing a tense atmosphere over the Mole household. Glenn's paternal grandmother, Pauline Mole (then Braithwaite) says that she can like the child, but love could take some working on. Glenn eventually leaves Sharon and moves in with his father and half-brother William. Inside a Mother's Day card for Sharon, Glenn's card reads: \"You are mad and always sad, That is why I live with Dad\". In  his early teens, Glenn becomes obsessed with <a href=\"/wiki/David_Beckham\" title=\"David Beckham\">David Beckham</a> and his family, so much to the point where he gets a Beckham haircut and adopts his accent.

As a child, he worries Adrian by becoming obsessed with <a href=\"/wiki/Barbie\" title=\"Barbie\">Barbie</a> dolls, asking for a Barbie-themed Easter egg and a Barbie hair-dressing salon for Christmas. Jojo never sees her son, and William never asks about her, yet he surprises Adrian by crying for his mother at the Safeway's cr\u00e8che. Adrian uses him as an excuse to see Mary-Lou Hattersly, the proprietor of said cr\u00e8che, with whom Adrian has a slight infatuation.

Bianca works as a waitress at Savage's, and introduces Adrian to his first job there. Bianca previously worked in the local newsagents when he lived with Pandora and the Palmer family. Adrian and Bianca enjoy a very physical relationship, to the point where Bianca starts becoming delicate around her genitals. Bianca had a very boring, <a href=\"/wiki/Christian\" title=\"Christian\">Christian</a> upbringing; her father, the Reverend Dartington, is a strict man, and her mother was forty-eight when she gave birth. Bianca has two elder siblings: Derek and Mary. Adrian is surprised that his girlfriend can come from such a boring, plain family, as Bianca has a strong personality and has good looks. Adrian and Bianca spend Christmas at the Dartington household - it was a disaster. The couple were the only two to bring presents, as the others donated money to <a href=\"/wiki/Sudan\" title=\"Sudan\">Sudan</a>. When Bianca moans that they didn't tell her, Adrian claims that it was to show that they had the moral high-ground; probably the right answer. And as if the stay wasn't bad enough, Adrian's presents were disasters. Mrs. Dartington was allergic to the peach-related present he gave her, and Reverend Dartington responded frostily to the poetry and trainspotting books Adrian bought him. However, after one stay with Adrian's family, Bianca develops an affair with Pauline's much younger husband, Martin Muffet, a fellow engineer. Grandma Mole spots the two sat together on top of a bus, and at <a href=\"/wiki/King%27s_Cross_St._Pancras_tube_station\" title=\"King&#39;s Cross St. Pancras tube station\">St. Pancras station</a>, one of Bianca's favorite places as it is \"the world's largest unsupported structure\", Adrian goes to greet Bianca to be greeted with Martin Muffet's arm around her shoulders, giving Adrian and Pauline a shared heartbreak. Bianca takes her belongings from the flat and leaves with Muffet. One point of anxiety for her is that when people hire her for a job, they are thrown by the fact that she is a girl, and she was seriously considering putting 'Brian Dartington' on her <a href=\"/wiki/Curriculum_vitae\" title=\"Curriculum vitae\">CV</a>.</li>\n<li><b>Pamela Pigg</b> is Adrian's first housing officer and later girlfriend. Adrian puts 'gay' on his housing application form, and Pamela is surprised by Adrian's stereotypical view on gay people, and gives an example of the previous week when she evicted a gay couple who lived in a shambles and owned a dog that terrorized the neighbors. Pamela's father teaches kayaking, and prefers to be known as 'Porky', and her mother 'Perky'. Adrian and Pamela have nicknames for each other: 'Snuffly' for Adrian and 'Piglet' for Pamela. Pamela is sometimes ashamed of her parents' behavior, and develops a tick in her left eye when her father and boyfriend don't get on. Her name is a source of embarrassment for her, and one particular sad memory is of her first day as a substitute teacher. Pamela and Adrian have a stressful relationship - the two argue, split up and reconcile frequently. The first-split up occurs when Pamela reads the first few chapters of <i>Sty</i>, Adrian's new manuscript, which involves a pig called Pamela. The two reconcile when Pamela goes on a <a href=\"/wiki/Hen_night\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hen night\">hen night</a> with her <a href=\"/wiki/Lesbian\" title=\"Lesbian\">lesbian</a> friends Philippa and Mary, and the couple's song starts playing on the disco floor. They again split up when she sees <a href=\"/wiki/Kingsley_Amis\" title=\"Kingsley Amis\">Kingsley Amis</a>'s <i><a href=\"/wiki/Letter_(message)\" title=\"Letter (message)\">Letters</a></i> on the kitchen table. They again reconcile when Pamela tells Adrian that she has two <a href=\"/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon\" title=\"Pok\u00e9mon\">Pok\u00e9mon</a> Easter eggs for William and Glenn, just the type that Adrian was looking for. When the two do eventually consummate their relationship, there is an earthquake that knocks the tiles off the roof - \"the first time anyone has made the world move for me\", so Pamela says - and secondly, William walks in on the two in bed, and says that the two would have to get married (William had never seen his own parents in bed, let alone with other people). Pamela eventually leaves Adrian for a <a href=\"/wiki/Country_singer\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Country singer\">country singer</a> named Alan Clarke, but remains Adrian's housing officer. She and Adrian reconcile for one last time before going the separate ways, just days before Adrian's house is raided and he is arrested.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Braithwaite_family\">Braithwaite family</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=List_of_Adrian_Mole_characters&amp;action=edit&amp;section=17\" title=\"Edit section: Braithwaite family\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Pandora_Braithwaite\">Pandora Braithwaite</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=List_of_Adrian_Mole_characters&amp;action=edit&amp;section=18\" title=\"Edit section: Pandora Braithwaite\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Pandora_Braithwaite\" title=\"Pandora Braithwaite\">Pandora Braithwaite</a></div>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Ivan_Braithwaite\">Ivan Braithwaite</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=List_of_Adrian_Mole_characters&amp;action=edit&amp;section=19\" title=\"Edit section: Ivan Braithwaite\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><b>Ivan Braithwaite</b> is the father of Pandora, first husband of Tania and fourth husband of Pauline.

Miss Elf tells the children that by the year 2000, everyone will fly using jetpacks, their skin will be cappuccino-colored and there will be world peace - Adrian mentions that she is later locked away in a mental institution, after saying that the shock of the real world could kill her.</li>\n<li><b>Ms Fossington-Gore-Lambert</b> (n\u00e9e <b>Fossington-Gore</b>) is the unfortunate art teacher at Neil Armstrong Comprehensive, and is given the job of taking the children on a school trip during which the children go mad, Barry Kent goes missing and the British Museum considers banning school parties.

Barry commits educational suicide firstly by wearing a <a href=\"/wiki/Union_Jack\" title=\"Union Jack\">Union Jack</a> <a href=\"/wiki/T-shirt\" title=\"T-shirt\">T-shirt</a> to school, upon which the local newspaper gets involved, and secondly when he wears his studded leather jacket and chains to school, leading Mr. Scruton to ban studs from everywhere other than on the bottom of football boots. At the age of sixteen, Kent becomes strongly <a href=\"/wiki/Anti-racist\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Anti-racist\">anti-racist</a>. Barry has a natural gift for poetry, which Adrian encourages him to develop. He regrets this when Barry becomes not only a successful poet, but the author of a hit novel <i>Dork's Diary</i> which revolves around a loser called \"Aiden Vole\", a tongue-in-cheek reference to the Adrian Mole books themselves. Barry Kent succeeds on natural talent, which Adrian Mole has clearly been unable to find in himself. Adrian tries to turn his defeat into victory by creating a fictional character, the failed writer \"Kent Barry\", in a novel that is never published. Barry is friends with people such as <a href=\"/wiki/Angela_Hacker\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Angela Hacker\">Angela Hacker</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Jeanette_Winterson\" title=\"Jeanette Winterson\">Jeanette Winterson</a>.

Despite having a brief relationship with Pandora, Nigel moves to London and comes out as a gay man. Nigel goes through a period when he becomes a punk rocker, and pierces his ear with a safety pin and receives blood poisoning as a result. In the last novel he is forced to move to his parents' granny flat, having become blind, as Townsend herself did. Nigel turns to Buddhism, and becomes a delivery driver for <a href=\"/wiki/Next_plc\" title=\"Next plc\">Next</a>. Nigel meets Lance Lovett, a fellow blind homosexual, and in the final book the two marry at the local aristocrat mansion, with their event organized by Adrian's wife Daisy, despite the fact that they were separated at the time. Both Nigel and Lance have great color co-ordination sense, and decorate their flat with matching colors and candles, much to Adrian's concern. Nigel receives a guide dog named Graham, who dies in the final book and Adrian is called upon to bury the dog - the second dog in twenty years. Nigel becomes more skeptical about Adrian and his lifestyle, much to Adrian's annoyance. Nigel has a brief stint as Pandora's personal assistant. In the original TV series and in <i>Adrian Mole and the Small Amphibians</i>, his name is given as Nigel Partridge.</li>\n<li><b>Sharon Bott</b> (occasionally <b>Botts</b>) is Adrian's second girlfriend and the mother of his first child. She is introduced in Growing Pains as the girl who \"will show everything for 50p and a pound of grapes\", but Adrian has an unsuccessful date with her set up by Nigel. In True Confessions, Adrian has lost his virginity with Sharon, but it is obvious that neither of them has any other interest in the other beyond sex. Sharon starts putting on weight, and she is referred to as overweight in the later books. After it is proven that Adrian fathered Glenn in Cappuccino Years, Sharon re-enters Adrian's life; they maintain a good relationship as parents of Glenn. It is revealed that she has seven siblings, including an older sister, Marjorie, and younger brother, Karak. Her parents are still alive. Mr. Bott is a quiet, polite man, unlike the rest of the Bott family. As Sharon ages, she gains more and more weight until she is described as obese. A character in <i>Lo! The Flat Hills of My Homeland</i> named Sharon Slagg, based on Sharon, is mentioned. While Sharon is still seeing Adrian, she starts seeing Barry Kent on the side, leading to confusion over who Glenn's father is - a blood test revealed that Adrian was indeed the father.</li>\n<li><b>Bruce \"Brainbox\" Henderson</b> is one of Adrian's friends who is good with computers. He starts the school magazine. In later books, he marries Adrian's ex-fianc\u00e9e (and later sister-in-law) Marigold Flowers.</li>\n<li><b>Claire Neilson</b> is Pandora's best friend. She is a beautiful yet snobbish type, who looks down on Adrian and is part of his and Pandora's political party, the Pink Brigade. Her cat is expecting kittens as of the first book. In <i>Weapons of Mass Destruction</i>, she appears at the school reunion as a worried-looking type who has lost her beauty and constantly worries about whether her children are in bed.</li>\n<li><b>Barbara Boyer</b> is another attractive girl, who becomes part of a love triangle between herself, Adrian and Pandora. After Nigel Hetherington tells the entire school about their affair, Boyer ends the saga. She appears for one appearance at the political party, but she argues with Pandora over China's significance, and Pandora asks Claire (who brought her in the first place) not to bring her again. At the school reunion, she is now a stunning woman on her fifth husband. In the final book, she holds her birthday party at Nigel's flat. Adrian stumbles upon the party when he calls in on Nigel, and for a couple of hours enjoys himself, and realises later that if he hadn't gone to Nigel's, he wouldn't have known about the party.</li>\n<li><b>Danny Thompson</b> is a boy in Adrian's class who forms a <a href=\"/wiki/Rastafari_movement\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Rastafari movement\">Rasta</a> band, and gains the nickname \"the White Rasta\".

When Adrian asks her if she lives on the estate (which he does), she replies with \"Of course not! Do I look like a nutter?\" It is mentioned in <i>Weapons of Mass Destruction</i> that she now owns an interior design company.</li>\n<li><b>Victoria Louise Thomson</b> is a girl in Adrian's Science class. She passes Adrian a note from Elizabeth Broadway asking him if she will go out with him. She reappears in <i>Weapons of Mass Destruction</i> at the school reunion, where Adrian learns that she has moved up the social ladder by marrying a series of rich men.</li>\n<li><b>Mohammed Parvez</b> (later referred to as <b>Parvez</b>) is a former school friend of Adrian. He played a heroin-addicted Jesus in an \"experimental\" Nativity play directed by Adrian. By the time of <i>Lost Diaries</i> Mohammed is married to Fatima, has had several children, and runs a garage. In order to deflect press accusations of racism against her, Pandora invited herself and a <i><a href=\"/wiki/Newsnight\" title=\"Newsnight\">Newsnight</a></i> crew to Mohammed's  house for dinner, leaving Fatima annoyed at being expected to cook. Parvez later changes careers to become an accountant, and is hired to give Adrian financial advice - which Adrian completely ignores, contributing to his mounting debt problem. It is unclear whether Parvez is related to William's headmistress Mrs. Parvez.</li>\n<li><b>Wayne Wong</b> is a former school friend of Adrian.

Doreen is described as thin from top to bottom with no chest, no bum, buck teeth and ginger hair, which leads to her nickname Stick Insect. She slept with George Mole on several occasions - Adrian notices the ginger hairs left on his mother's pillow. After spending a fortune on flowers in a (failed) attempt to woo Pauline, George packs the flowers into the back of his car and drives off in the direction of Doreen's house. Doreen shows up on the Mole family doorstep after Pauline returns, and shows George her baby bump. George is worried, and breaks the news to Pauline and Adrian on holiday in <a href=\"/wiki/Skegness\" title=\"Skegness\">Skegness</a>. Pauline sends him away to look after Doreen, while Pauline calls on Tania Braithwaite to take her home, as well as Tania providing a shoulder to cry on.

Doreen's family look down on George, especially when Maxwell, the vicar, says that Doreen once quoted: \"George Mole is the only man I'll ever love; I just live for the day when he'll come back to me\". George confides in Adrian that, since Brett's birth, he has been sending \u00a320 a week to her to help her get by. Whether Doreen and Trevor Roper ever get married is not told, but the events at the funeral hint that they never did get married.

The two seem to have grease running through their bloodstream, as their hair, skin and pores are clogged with it. Eddie gets a headache if he and Sandra do not have sex every day, and he was on Neurofen when Sandra went to the General Hospital to have her veins operated on.

He and Adrian are very close friends, so much to the point that Carlton-Hayes becomes a surrogate father figure to Adrian. He had two children from a previous marriage, Marcus and Claudia. Whether his previous marriage resulted in widowhood or divorce is unclear, but the marriage is over as Carlton-Hayes lives with his partner, Leslie. He and Michael Flowers once had a fight in the library car park, with Carlton-Hayes walking away the winner. Carlton-Hayes suffers from a liver disease, and is rushed to hospital where he sports blue-and-white striped pyjamas and becomes somewhat addicted to reality television programmes. After he left the hospital, he became wheelchair bound and had to close up shop due to this and lack of intakes. Adrian still tries to keep contact with his employer after the closure. Carlton-Hayes is a distant relation of Hugo Fairfax-Lycett. The bookshop was started by Hugh's father, Arthur Carlton-Hayes.</li>\n<li><b>Colonel Bernard Hopkins</b> is an eccentric, frequently drunk and often suicidal man who Adrian calls in (in <i>The Prostrate Years</i>) to look after the bookshop due to the frequent absences of both Carlton-Hayes and himself, due to illness. Bernard seems to have led a colourful life, having been born into a working-class mining family, attended Cambridge on a scholarship, risen to the rank of Colonel in the British Army and spent much of his free time in whorehouses. Adrian notes that Bernard is an expert with antique books but isn't very pleasant to customers, to the point where he has been blacklisted from working at any <a href=\"/wiki/Waterstones\" title=\"Waterstones\">Waterstones</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Borders\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Borders\">Borders</a> stores. He invites himself to Christmas dinner at Adrian's home and refuses to leave until Adrian has recovered from his prostate cancer, taking up permanent residence. Adrian and Bernard become close friends during Bernard's stay at The Piggeries, helping Adrian with household chores and a friendly ear. He becomes engaged to a local woman in Mangold Parva, Mrs. Dorothea Lewis-Masters, but reveals something else: his legal wife is alive and kicking on the other side of the country. Bernard provides Adrian with chickens and a coop, and pigs with a pigsty.</li>\n<li><b>Hitesh</b> is a teenager on a work experience placement, whom Carlton-Hayes brought in to manage the computer. When the bookshop closes, Hitesh is not applicable to redundancy pay as he had not been employed for two years or more. Hitesh says that he will get a job at <a href=\"/wiki/KFC\" title=\"KFC\">KFC</a>, where his cousin is manager.</li>\n<li><b>Leslie</b> is Carlton-Hayes's partner. His gender remains unspecified until <i>The Prostrate Years</i>, when Adrian, Hitesh and Bernard Hopkins visit him at home. Leslie worries deeply for his partner's welfare. He sometimes covers for other staff members when they are ill.</li></ul>\n<h2><span id=\"Leicestershire_.26_Rutland_Creative_Writing_Group\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Leicestershire_&amp;_Rutland_Creative_Writing_Group\">Leicestershire &amp; Rutland Creative Writing Group</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=List_of_Adrian_Mole_characters&amp;action=edit&amp;section=55\" title=\"Edit section: Leicestershire &amp; Rutland Creative Writing Group\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><b>Ken Blunt</b> is the longest-serving member of the LRWG.

The series includes comment on the <a href=\"/wiki/UK_fuel_protests#September_2000_protests\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"UK fuel protests\">petrol crisis of 2000</a>, the <a href=\"/wiki/9/11\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"9/11\">9/11 attacks</a> and the <a href=\"/wiki/War_on_Terrorism\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"War on Terrorism\">War on Terrorism</a>. Adrian's illegitimate half-brother Brett Mole, born on 5 August 1982, is reintroduced as a 19-year-old; he is an athletic, popular, confident, promiscuous, super-intelligent Oxford undergraduate, already a published poet and TV documentarian \u2013 in short, the person Adrian always wanted to be. Brett's mediocre older sibling soon comes to regard him with envious loathing. In what was apparently supposed to be a retrospectively-written preface to the re-published Diaries, Mole notes their re-publication in novel-form and suggests that Townsend is impersonating him and profiting from his writings. He also claims that his life is still not as happy as he would like, but 'that is another story' \u2013 suggesting that there is another diary to come.</li>\n<li>To mark the royal wedding between Prince William and Catherine Middleton, Sue Townsend wrote an exclusive Adrian Mole story for the Observer in 2011.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup></li>\n<li>An obscure chapter of Adrian's life appeared in the Christmas 1994 edition of the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Radio_Times\" title=\"Radio Times\">Radio Times</a></i>.
