Entoman is a fictional character created by David FÃ¼leki. He is an anthropomorphic duck with superhuman powers who has major or minor roles in many comic books. According to his creator, Entoman is the incarnation of Siegmund Freud's id , which means that he does everything he wants without being bound by his conscience. Furthermore, Entoman often shows very crude forms of brutality but also high intelligence and even childish behavior. His only weakness may be his desire for ice cream.
