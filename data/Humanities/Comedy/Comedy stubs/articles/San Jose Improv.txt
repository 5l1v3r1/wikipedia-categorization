The San Jose Improv is a comedy club located in San Jose, California. Formerly known as the Jose Theater, built in 1904, is the oldest theater in San Jose, located on Second Street, near San Fernando Street.  Construction of the Jose was started in 1903, under the ownership of David Jacks, a Monterey landowner (who was the namesake of Monterrey Jack cheese).  At that time, the theater was a popular showcase for stock companies and vaudeville acts. Despite rumors, neither Charlie Chaplin, or Harry Houdini ever perform at this location, although both have toured through San Francisco.    Today, it is home to the San Jose franchise of the famous Improv Comedy Club chain and is owned by LEG.
