A dribble glass is a drinking glass that has holes hidden in the etched design.  The purpose of a dribble glass is for pranks. When a person tilts the glass to take a drink from this glass, they will end up spilling the liquid on their clothing as the drink trickles through the holes. The dribble glass was invented by S.S. Adams.
