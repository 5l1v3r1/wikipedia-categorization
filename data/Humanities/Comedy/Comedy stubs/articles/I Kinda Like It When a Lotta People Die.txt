I Kinda Like It When a Lotta People Die is the 20th album, and first posthumous album by stand-up comedian George Carlin. The album contains unreleased material, opening with a home recording done in 1957  to an entire show recorded live from the MGM Grand Las Vegas on September 9 and 10, 2001; this show would be shelved by Carlin due to the September 11 attacks.  The title of the album stemmed from the title of the original show, which would be re-tooled, re-titled Complaints and Grievances and recorded at the Beacon Theatre in New York City two months later. The title was later planned to be re-used for a special in 2004, but was again discarded due to Hurricane Katrina. That special was later called Life Is Worth Losing, and features a re-tooled version of the "Uncle Dave" bit originally recorded during the 2001 show. The album features liner notes written by comedian Lewis Black,  plus interviews with former manager Jerry Hamza and longtime comedy special producer Rocco Urbisci. The album streamed on SiriusXMâ€™s Comedy Greats channel two weeks prior to its release.
