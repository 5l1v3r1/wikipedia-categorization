Groucho glasses, also known as nose glasses or the beaglepuss, are a humorous novelty disguise which function as a caricature of the stage makeup used by the comedian Groucho Marx in his movies and vaudeville performances.  They typically consist of black frames (either round or horn-rimmed) with attached features including bushy eyebrows, a large plastic nose, bushy moustache, and sometimes a plastic cigar. Considered one of the most iconic and widely used of all novelty items in the world, Groucho glasses were first marketed in the early 1940s  and are instantly recognizable to people throughout the world.   Groucho glasses today are often used as a shorthand for slapstick.
