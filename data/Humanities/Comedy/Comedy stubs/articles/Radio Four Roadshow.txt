  The Radio Four Roadshow was a 1980s UK radio comedy series, broadcast on BBC Radio 4. The programme's comedian presenters, who included Tony Hawks, would visit a different town or city in the UK in each edition.  The running joke was that the presenters were trying to entice young people away from BBC Radio One, a pop music station, to Radio Four, a conservative speech-based station.  The title of the programme was derived from the BBC Radio One roadshows (in which the station's disc jockeys would tour Britain's seaside resorts each summer, presenting from a different town each day).  The show, very much tongue-in-cheek, claimed that the Radio Four Roadshow was "just like the Radio One roadshow.  Except indoors, in the middle of winter, and with everyone sitting in rows". The programme featured contemporary Radio One jingles, but with the sung word "one" in the original jingle replaced by a Radio Four continuity announcer speaking the word "four".
