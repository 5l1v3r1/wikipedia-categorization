 Toilet humour or scatological humour is a type of off-colour humour dealing with defecation, urination and flatulence, and to a lesser extent vomiting and other body functions. It sees substantial crossover with sexual humour, such as dick jokes. Toilet humour is popular among a wide range of ages,  but is especially popular with children and teenagers, for whom cultural taboos related to acknowledgement of waste excretion still have a degree of novelty. The humour comes from the rejection of such taboos, and is a part of modern culture.   Examples can also be found in earlier literature, including The Canterbury Tales by Geoffrey Chaucer. Toilet humour is also found in song and rhyme, particularly schoolboy songs. Examples of this are found in Mozart and scatology, and variants of the German folk schoolboys' song known as the Schei√üe-Lied (English: "Shit-Song")   which is indexed in the German Volksliederarchiv.
