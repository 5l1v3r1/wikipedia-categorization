Lindeman is the name of a large family of fictional characters, all played by Swedish comedian Hans Alfredson, portrayed by improvised monologues. Every day, the interviewer, Lasse O'Månsson or Tage Danielsson, would talk about a topic from today's newspaper and introduce a Lindeman with a relevant occupation. Then, Alfredson would talk about the given topic. The first series of Lindemen appeared in the revue Gröna hund (Translation: Green Dog, a pun on Gröna Lund) 1962, where they all were called Valfrid and were interviewed by O'Månsson. The recurring punchline for this first series was that they always ended up getting their waistcoats stuck in their trouser zippers. Valfrid's son, Malte, appeared in Gula Hund (Translation: Yellow Dog) 1964, where the endings were all different. From this time on, Danielsson interviewed. In Lådan (Translation: The Box) 1966-1967 and Under dubbelgöken (Translation: Under the Double Cuckoo) 1979, many Lindemen with different names appeared.
