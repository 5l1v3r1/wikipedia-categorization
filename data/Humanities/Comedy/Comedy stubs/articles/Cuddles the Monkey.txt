Cuddles the Monkey was one half of Keith Harris's puppet act, the sidekick and nemesis of Orville the Duck. The monkey was orange, with a blue face.  He wore a white shirt collar and blue tie, and his catchphrase was "I hate that duck." In the TV show actress Ruth Verrall played the part of Cuddles when movement was needed.
