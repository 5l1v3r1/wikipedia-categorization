Documentary comedy is a form of comedy. The comic material used is presented in documentary style—usually, a report on a particular theme or issue—and with the same investigation and reporting methods used to gather the material. Well-known documentary comics include Dave Gorman,   Danny Wallace, Tony Hawks, Alex Horne  and Mark Steel. It is not to be confused with mockumentary, a form of spoof in which a documentary is played "straight" but based on fictitious material.
