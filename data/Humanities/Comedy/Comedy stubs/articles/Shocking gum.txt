Shocking gum is a practical joke device that delivers a harmless electric shock. The victim is offered a stick of gum from a box, and touching this triggers the shock. A few novelty companies in the 1950s produced these 'Shocking gum' packages. The most popular brands of Shocking Gum are Fruit Juicy and JB.
