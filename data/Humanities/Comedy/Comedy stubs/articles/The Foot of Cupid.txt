The Foot of Cupid is a trademark of the BBC television series Monty Python's Flying Circus. It is often seen in the opening animation credits at middle, then at the end of the opening, dropping down on the title and everything around it with a sound similar to that of a short burst of flatulence (except during the first season, when a swishing sound is heard instead). It was based from Agnolo Bronzino's Venus, Cupid, Folly and Time and has been a trademark icon for the comedy troupe.
