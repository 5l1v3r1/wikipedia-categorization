Comedy's Dirtiest Dozen is a stand-up comedy concert film featuring big name talents before they reached stardom, including Tim Allen, Chris Rock, and Bill Hicks.  It was created and produced by Stuart S. Shapiro after the cult success of his film Mondo New York. The performances were shot on film, instead of on tape like most comedy shows of the time. Island Films (an offshoot of Chris Blackwell's Island Records) intended to run Comedy's Dirtiest Dozen in theaters and not on cable TV. Due to financial changes at Island, the film was only screened in New York and Los Angeles, only to be released on VHS and DVD after  Tim Allen and Chris Rock became stars. It has been shown on The Ovation Channel.  Richard Baker and Rick Messina of Messina Baker Mgmt auditioned hundred of comics in New York and Los Angeles for this production.                     In reviewing the film Playboy magazine singled out Chris Rock and Larry Scarano as standouts. Otto & George and Bill Hicks were praised in other reviews.
