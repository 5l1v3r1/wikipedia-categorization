Struck Off and Die were a British comedy duo consisting of doctors Tony Gardner and Phil Hammond during the 1990s. Their material drew heavily on their knowledge and experience of healthcare, and took a particularly cynical view of the problems that beset the UK's National Health Service. They met while junior doctors at Frenchay Hospital, in Bristol, England, during the late 1980s. Later, they had their own radio series on BBC Radio 4. Series one covered various areas of the health service. It included sketches and vox pop segments. Episodes 1 and 2 were released on a compilation CD by the BBC. Series two took as its theme Shakespeare's seven ages of man from As You Like It. A third series followed in 2000, entitled the Struck Off and Die Family Health Companion. It was broadcast from 29 March 2000 to 6 May 2000. Both of them have since led divergent careers, with Tony Gardner concentrating on acting, and Phil Hammond in writing, presenting, teaching medical students and general practice.
