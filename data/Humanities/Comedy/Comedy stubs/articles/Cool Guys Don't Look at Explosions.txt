"Cool Guys Don't Look at Explosions" is a song performed by Andy Samberg, Will Ferrell, and J. J. Abrams at the 2009 MTV Movie Awards. It is a soft rock song dedicated to a popular film cliche in which characters are depicted leaving the scene of an explosion unfazed by the destruction behind them.  Andy Samberg appears as a Bruce Springsteen-like character performing in a warehouse. Film clips of numerous "slow walks" from explosions play as he performs. Then, Will Ferrell as Neil Diamond is introduced to the viewers by Samberg. They then sing about various other clips, including Mark Wahlberg wearing a hat in the film Shooter. Samberg then yells, "Keyboard solo, J.J. Abrams!" as the camera turns toward J. J. Abrams (director of Star Trek and creator of Lost) playing the keyboard with one hand. They continue to sing as more film clips are displayed. At the end, it shows Samberg and Ferrell walking away from a building that bursts into flames in a large explosion. However, unlike in most films, they cower at the sight of the explosion instead of calmly walking away.
