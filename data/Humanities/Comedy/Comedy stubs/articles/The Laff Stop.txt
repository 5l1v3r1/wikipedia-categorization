The Laff Stop was a comedy club, with locations in Texas and California.   The Laff Stop originated in Newport Beach, California and featured comics such as Steve Martin, David Letterman, and Robin Williams.   There were also Laff Stop clubs in Claremont, California and Austin, Texas (which changed its name to Cap City Comedy Club in 1996).  The location in Houston, Texas was open since 1977, and was one of the most successful clubs through the 1990s. It closed on December 19, 2009 in a surprise announcement.   The Houston Laff Stop changed locations a few times during its existence, the last stop becoming an upstairs strip mall location at Waugh and the Allen Parkway.  The previous location on West Gray Street is now a bar called Local Pour. The club later served as a starting point and hometown club for such acts as Ralphie May and Brett Butler.
