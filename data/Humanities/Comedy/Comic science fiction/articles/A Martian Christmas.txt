A Martian boy, Kip, was caught up in an intergalactic race to save both Christmas and Earth. On 6 October 2008, The Hollywood Reporter reported that A Martian Christmas is in development from Porchlight Entertainment and Ánima Estudios.  Post-production services was handled by Telegael. The film received mixed reviews. IMDB reported the film received a 7.1 audience rating out of 10.  Sierra Filucci of Common Sense Media gave this film 2 out of 5 stars and said, "Unfortunately the build-up to the main part of the story -- the journey to Earth -- takes so long and is packed with so much backstory that kids and even adults might get lost, or just bored. Once the trip begins, things pick up and it's sort of interesting to see humans and Christmas from outsiders' eyes."  This film was released on DVD on 11 November 2009 by PorchLight Home Entertainment. Due to its obscurity, it remains one of the rarest films to this day, most likely due to lack of promotion, and the fact that this film was primarily produced in Mexico, as it is difficult for a Mexican animated production to get into the United States market, according to producer Fernando de Fuentes.  The DVD of the film is only available on online shopping sites, such as eBay and Amazon.com.
