Future Folk is a New York City-based folk music comedy duo. Founded as a live act in 2004, the duo includes General Trius (Nils d'Aulaire) and The Mighty Kevin (Jay Klaitz). After co-starring in an Off-off-Broadway musical comedy titled Who Is Wilford Brimley?,  d’Aulaire and Klaitz brainstormed ideas for an act that involved roots music from outer space.  They composed songs for the project, which revolved around a fictitious planet named Hondo, and crafted costume helmets from plastic buckets and duct tape. After a performance in New York’s East Village, they evolved the act, expanding back stories and developing their characters with each performance. They first appeared as Future Folk in 2005 at Tonic in Times Square, performing at a party celebrating the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show.  In 2012, Future Folk filmed a feature-length movie, The History of Future Folk, which chronicles the duo's arrival on Earth and their subsequent attempt to save both Hondo and Earth from annihilation.  Jeremy Kipp Walker and John Anderson Mitchell, who provided writing, production and directorial guidance, simplified the pair's back story to accommodate the narrative within the film's modest budget.  The feature film was distributed by Variance Films in 2013.  and became available on Netflix in 2014. Future Folk has received positive critical reviews, with the Washington Post describing their film performance as "goofy, endearing and wholesome,"  and the Los Angeles Times praising their "sweet harmonies" and "impressive acoustic picking."
