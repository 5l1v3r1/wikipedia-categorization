The Sims 3: Into the Future is the eleventh and final expansion pack for The Sims 3 series from Electronic Arts and was released on October 22, 2013 in North America.  It is available for both Windows and OS X. In Europe it was released on October 24, 2013 and in the United Kingdom on October 25, 2013.  The expansion is futuristic themed. Upon installation, players may be visited by a time traveller in their home neighborhood, who gives their sims his time portal for use upon receiving help from the player. Using this portal, sims can travel to the future, into a new sub-neighborhood called "Oasis Landing", a futuristic town built amongst mountainous wastelands.  Plumbots (similar to simbots and servos in previous sim games) are a major addition to the expansion. They can be built and fully customized with the new "Create-A-Bot" mode, and players can create various trait chips that determines their personality, use and gameplay. Hoverboards, jetpacks, monorails and hovercars are introduced to the game as new transportation options. New careers include astronomers and bot dealers. New objects include holographic TVs, food synthesizers, build-a-bot workshops and the laser rythimacon, a new instrument.  Sims are also able to visit their future descendants during time travel, and can change or eliminate these descendants altogether if the player sends the sim back to the present and changes their lifestyle or fate.  On January 8, 2013, it was revealed on the live broadcast that Electronic Arts plans to release a futuristic-themed expansion pack which was still in the early stages of development.  The game received many favorable reviews.
