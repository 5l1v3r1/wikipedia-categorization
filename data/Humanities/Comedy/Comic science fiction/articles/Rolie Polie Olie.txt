 Rolie Polie Olie  is a French-Canadian-American children's television series produced by Nelvana and Sparx*, distributed by Disney, and created by William Joyce, Maggie Swanson, and Anne Wood. The show focuses on a little robot who is composed of several spheres and other three-dimensional geometric shapes. The show was one of the earliest series that was fully animated in CG, and the first CG-animated preschool series.  Rolie Polie Olie aired reruns on Disney Junior from March 23, 2012 â€“ September 28, 2014. Rolie Polie Olie won a Gemini Award in Canada for "Best Animated Program" in 1999. The show also won a Daytime Emmy Award for "Outstanding Special Class Animated Program" in 2000 and 2005. William Joyce won a 1999 Daytime Emmy for Best Production Design for this series.  The show has a vintage atmosphere reminiscent of the 1950s to mid-1960s,  with futuristic elements. The show focuses on the Polie Family, who live in a teapot-shaped house in a geometric world (Planet Polie) populated by robot-based characters. The stories revolve around a young robot named Olie learning life lessons and going on wacky adventures (either real or imaginative) while growing up. These often include his little sister Zowie, his inventor father, his hard-working mom, his fun-loving grandfather Pappy, and his dog Spot. Although most of the main cast is composed of circular bots, other characters are featured in other shapes, such as Olie's friend Billy Bevel and his family, who are square-shaped bots from Planet Cubey.
