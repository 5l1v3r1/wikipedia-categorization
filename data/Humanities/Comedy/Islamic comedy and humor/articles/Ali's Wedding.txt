  Ali's Wedding is a 2017 Australian romantic comedy feature film from Matchbox Pictures.    It is directed by Jeffrey Walker and written by Osamah Sami and stars Sami, Helana Sawires, Don Hany and Ryan Corr. Sami has been quoted as saying that the film is "history making, the first Muslim rom-com, so it's going to hopefully pave the way for many other similar stories, not just from the Muslim community but from other communities and minorities in our society." He said that the "affectionate and poignant story of love" was trying to cast a more positive light on Muslim-Australian life.  Ali (Osamah Sami), the charming and musically-talented son of a Muslim cleric (Don Hany), struggles to make the right life choices despite the best of intentions. He wants to be with the girl, Dianne (Helana Sawires), he loves, but he's been promised to another girl at his father's mosque. He wants to be the great doctor that the community expects him to be, but he doesn't get the marks. Above all, he wants to make his father proud. To live up to these impossible expectations, he lies about his academic achievements, and then his quest to please his father spirals out of control, with amusing and poignant consequences.
