Titus Quinctius Atta (died 77 BC) was a Roman comedy writer, and, like Titinius and Afranius, was distinguished as a writer of fabulae togatae, national comedies.   He had the reputation of being a vivid delineator of character, especially female. He also seems to have published a collection of epigrams.  The scanty fragments contain many archaisms, but are lively in style. According to Horace (Epistles, ii 1. 79), the plays of Atta were still put on the stage in his lifetime.   We only have the titles (and associated fragments) of twelve of Atta's plays.  This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Chisholm, Hugh, ed. (1911).
