A mesostic is a poem or other  text arranged so that a vertical phrase intersects lines of horizontal text. It is similar to an acrostic, but with the vertical phrase intersecting somewhere in the midst of the line, as opposed to the beginning of each line. The practice of using index words to select pieces from a preexisting text was developed by Jackson Mac Low as "diastics". It was used extensively by the experimental composer John Cage (Walsh 2001). There are two types of mesostic: fifty percent and one hundred percent. (See also the example below.) Below, an example of a one-hundred-percent mesostic: It qualifies as a one-hundred-percent mesostic because there is no k or i in the text between the capital K of line 1 and the capital I of line 2 – – no i or t between the capital I and T – – and so on.
