The fudepen (筆ペン), also known as "Brush Pen", is a cartridges-based writing instrument used in East Asian calligraphy; in essence, an ink brush analogue to fountain pen. It consists of a pen nib that mimics the brush-like quality of the ink brush with either brush strands as in a normal ink brush or a soft felt tip similar to a marker; the nibs are fed by an ink reservoir. The ink used is unlike traditional calligraphy ink.  It is designed to adhere well to modern paper, while traditional ink only adheres well to rice paper. They are typically manufactured by Japanese companies such as Pentel, Sakura Color Products Corporation and Kuretake (art products).
