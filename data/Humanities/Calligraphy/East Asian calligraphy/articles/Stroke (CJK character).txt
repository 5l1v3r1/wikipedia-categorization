CJK strokes are the calligraphic strokes needed to write the Chinese characters in regular script used in East Asian calligraphy. CJK strokes are the classified set of line patterns that may be arranged and combined to form Chinese characters (also known as Hanzi) in use in China, Japan, and Korea.  The study and classification of CJK strokes aid in:[according to whom?] When writing Han radicals, a single stroke includes all the motions necessary to produce a given part of a character before lifting the writing instrument from the writing surface; thus, a single stroke may have abrupt changes in direction within the line. For example: CJK strokes are an attempt to identify and classify all single-stroke components that can be used to write Han radicals. There are some thirty distinct types of strokes recognized in Chinese characters, some of which are compound strokes made from basic strokes. The compound strokes comprise more than one movement of the writing instrument, and many of these have no agreed-upon name. A basic stroke is a single calligraphic mark moving in one direction across a writing surface. The following table lists a selection of basic strokes divided into two stroke groups: simple and combining. "Simple strokes" (such as Héng "Horizontal" and Diǎn "Dot") can be written alone. "Combining strokes" (such as Zhé "Break" and Gōu "Hook") never occur alone, but must be paired with at least one other stroke forming a compound stroke. Thus, they are not in themselves individual strokes. Note, the basic stroke Diǎn  "Dot" is rarely a real dot. Instead it usually takes the shape of a very small line pointing in one of several directions, and may be long enough to be confused with other strokes. A compound stroke (also called a complex stroke) is produced when two or more basic strokes are combined in a single stroke written without lifting the writing instrument from the writing surface. The character 永 (pinyin: yǒng) "eternity" described in more detail below demonstrates one of these compound strokes. The centre line is a compound stroke that combines three stroke shapes in a single stroke. In most cases, concatenating basic strokes together form a compound stroke. For example, Shù combined with Gōu produce  (Shù Gōu). A stroke naming convention sums the names of the basic strokes, in the writing order. An exception to this applies when a stroke makes a turn of 90° (and only of 90°). Horizontal  (Héng) and Vertical  (Shù) strokes are identified only once when they appear as the first stroke of a compound; any single stroke with successive 90° turns down or to the right are indicated by a 折 (pinyin: Zhé) "Break". For example, an initial Shù followed by an abrupt turn right produces  (Shù Zhé). In the same way, an initial Shù followed by an abrupt turn right followed by a second turn down produces  (Shù Zhé Zhé). Nearly all complex strokes can be named using this simple scheme. Organization systems used to describe and differentiate strokes may include the use of roman letters, Chinese characters, numbers, or a combination of these devices. Two methods of organizing CJK strokes are by: In classification schemes, stroke forms are described, assigned a representative character or letterform, and may be arranged in a hierarchy. In categorization schemes, stroke forms are differentiated, sorted and grouped into like categories; categories may be topical, or assigned by a numeric or alpha-numeric nominal number according to a designed numbering scheme. Organizing strokes into a hierarchy aids a user's understanding by bringing order to an obtuse system of writing that has organically evolved over the period of centuries. In addition, the process of recognizing and describing stroke patterns promotes consistency of stroke formation and usage. When organized by naming convention, classification allows a user to find a stroke quickly in a large stroke collection, makes it easier to detect duplication, and conveys meaning when comparing relationships between strokes. When organized by numbering scheme, categorization aids a user in understanding stroke differences, and makes it easier to make predictions, inferences and decisions about a stroke. Strokes are described and differentiated using the criteria of visual qualities of a stroke. Because this can require subjective interpretation, CJK strokes cannot be placed into a single definitive classification scheme because stroke types lack a universal consensus on the description and number of basic and compound forms. CJK strokes cannot be placed into a single definitive categorization scheme due to visual ambiguity between strokes, and therefore cannot be segregated into mutually-exclusive groups. Other factors inhibiting organization based on visual criteria is the variation of writing styles, and the changes of appearance that a stroke undergoes within various characters. A naming convention is a classification scheme where a controlled vocabulary is used systematically to describe the characteristics of an item. The naming convention for a CJK stroke is derived from the path mark left by the writing instrument. In this instance roman letters are concatenated to form a stroke name is a sequence of one or more roman letters indicating the component strokes used to create the CJK stroke. The first letter of the Han radical’s pinyin pronunciation represents each basic stroke. In a basic stroke example, H represents the stroke  named 横 (pinyin: Héng); in a compound example, HZT represents 横折提 (pinyin: Héng Zhé Tí). While no consensus exists, there are up to 12 distinct basic strokes that are identified by a unique Han radical. There are many CJK compound strokes, however there is no consensus for sequence letter naming of compound strokes using the basic strokes. The following table demonstrates the CJK stroke naming convention: A numbering scheme is a categorization method where like-item strokes are grouped into categories labeled by nominal numbers. Category numbering may be an index of numbers of types, with sub-types indicated by decimal point followed by another number or a letter.  The following table is a common numbering scheme that uses similar names as the roman letter naming convention, but the stroke forms are grouped into major category types (1 to 5), which further break down into 25 sub-types in category 5. Stroke order refers to the order in which the strokes of a Chinese character are written. A stroke is a movement of a writing instrument on a writing surface. Because most Chinese characters have many strokes, certain stroke orders guidelines are recommended to ensure speed, accuracy, and legibility in composition. Also, teachers enforce exactly one stroke order for each character, marking every deviation as a mistake, so everyone writes these characters the same way. The stroke order follows a few simple rules, though, which aids in memorizing these. To write CJK characters, one must know how to write CJK strokes, and thus, needs to identify the basic strokes that make up a character. The Eight Principles of Yong explain how to write eight common strokes in regular script which are found all in the one character, 永 (pinyin: yǒng, "forever", "permanence"). It was traditionally believed that the frequent practice of these principles as a beginning calligrapher could ensure beauty in one's writing. The stroke count method is based on the order of strokes to input characters on Chinese mobile phones. As part of Chinese character encoding, there have been several proposals to encode the CJK strokes, most of time with a total around 35~40 entries. Most notable is the current Unicode block “CJK Strokes” (U+31C0..U+31EF), with 36 types of strokes: CJK Unified Ideographs  ″  ″  ″ CJK Unified Ideographs Extension A CJK Unified Ideographs Extension B  ″  ″  ″  ″  ″  ″ CJK Unified Ideographs Extension C CJK Unified Ideographs Extension D CJK Unified Ideographs Extension E CJK Unified Ideographs Extension F CJK Radicals Supplement Kangxi Radicals Ideographic Description Characters CJK Symbols and Punctuation CJK Strokes Enclosed CJK Letters and Months CJK Compatibility CJK Compatibility Ideographs CJK Compatibility Forms Enclosed Ideographic Supplement CJK Compatibility Ideographs Supplement 20,992    6,592 42,720       4,160 224 5,776 7,488 128 224 16 64 48 256 256 512 32 256 544 20,976    6,582 42,711       4,149 222 5,762 7,473 115 214 12 64 36 254 256 472 32 64 542 4E00–62FF 6300–77FF 7800–8CFF 8D00–9FFF 3400–4DBF 20000–215FF 21600–230FF 23100–245FF 24600–260FF 26100–275FF 27600–290FF 29100–2A6DF 2A700–2B73F 2B740–2B81F 2B820–2CEAF 2CEB0–2EBEF 2E80–2EFF 2F00–2FDF 2FF0–2FFF 3000–303F 31C0–31EF 3200–32FF 3300–33FF F900–FAFF FE30–FE4F 1F200–1F2FF 2F800–2FA1F 1/4 2/4 3/4 4/4  1/7 2/7 3/7 4/7 5/7 6/7 7/7 0 BMP 0 BMP 0 BMP 0 BMP 0 BMP 2 SIP 2 SIP 2 SIP 2 SIP 2 SIP 2 SIP 2 SIP 2 SIP 2 SIP 2 SIP 2 SIP 0 BMP 0 BMP 0 BMP 0 BMP 0 BMP 0 BMP 0 BMP 0 BMP 0 BMP 1 SMP 2 SIP Unified Unified Unified Unified Unified Unified Unified Unified Unified Unified Unified Unified Unified Unified Unified Unified Not unified Not unified Not unified Not unified Not unified Not unified Not unified 12 are unified Not unified Not unified Not unified Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Common Han, Hangul, Common, Inherited Common Hangul, Katakana, Common Katakana, Common Han Common Hiragana, Common Han
