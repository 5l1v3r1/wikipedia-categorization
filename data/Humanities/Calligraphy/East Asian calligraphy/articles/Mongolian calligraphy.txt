Mongolian calligraphy is a form of calligraphy or artistic writing of the Mongolian language.  Although the Mongolian language in Mongolia uses a Cyrillic orthography adopted during the Communist era, Mongolian calligraphy is written in the traditional Mongolian bichig script. In 2013, Mongolian calligraphy was inscribed on the UNESCO List of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding.  At present, only three middle-aged scholars voluntarily train the small community of just over twenty young calligraphers. Traditionally, mentors select the best students and train them to be calligraphers over a period of five to eight years. Students and teachers bond for life and continue to stimulate each otherâ€™s artistic endeavours. The rate of social transformation, urbanization and globalization have led to a significant drop in the number of young calligraphers.
