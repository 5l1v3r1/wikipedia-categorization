Sini (from Arabic: صيني‎ Ṣīniy, "Chinese") is an calligraphic style used in China for the Arabic script. It can refer to any type of Chinese Arabic calligraphy, but is commonly used to refer to one with thick and tapered effects such as seen in Chinese calligraphy.  It is used extensively in mosques in eastern China, and to a lesser extent in Gansu, Ningxia, and Shaanxi.   One famous Sini calligrapher is Hajji Noor Deen Mi Guangjiang.
