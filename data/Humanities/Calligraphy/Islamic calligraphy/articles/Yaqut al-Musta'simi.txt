Yaqut al-Musta'simi (also Yakut-i Musta'simi) (died 1298 ) was a well-known calligrapher   and secretary of the last Abbasid caliph.  He was born of Greek origin in Amaseia and carried off when he was very young.  He codified six basic calligraphic styles of the Arabic script.  Naskh script was said to have been revealed and taught to the scribe in a vision. He developed Yakuti, a handwriting named after him, described as a thuluth of "a particularly elegant and beautiful type."  Supposedly he copied the Qur'an more than a thousand times.  He became a much-celebrated calligrapher across the Arab-speaking world. In the second half of the 13th-century, he gained the honorific, quiblat al-kuttab [cynosure of the calligraphers].
