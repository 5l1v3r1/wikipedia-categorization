Kurrent is an old form of German-language handwriting based on late medieval cursive writing, also known as Kurrentschrift, Alte Deutsche Schrift ("old German script") and German cursive. Over the history of its use into the first part of the 20th century, many individual letters acquired variant forms. German writers used both cursive styles, Kurrent and English cursive, in parallel: location, contents, and context of the text determined which script style to use. Sütterlin is a modern script based on Kurrent that is characterized by simplified letters and vertical strokes. It was developed in 1911 and taught in German schools as the primary script from 1935 until the beginning of January 1941. Then it was replaced with deutsche Normalschrift ("normal German handwriting"), which is sometimes referred to (correctly but confusingly) as "Latin writing". See Ausgangs‌schrift for examples of post-1941 school handwriting samples.
