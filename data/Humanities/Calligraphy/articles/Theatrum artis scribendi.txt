Theatrum Artis Scribendi is a book about calligraphy by Jodocus Hondius. The first edition was published in Amsterdam in 1594; a second edition was published in 1614 by his son, Johannes Janssonius. A facsimile, limited to 300 copies, was published in 1969 by Midland Publishers of the Netherlands. The facsimile was printed by N. Miedma and Co. of Leeuwarden and bound by Van Rijmenam N.V. in The Hague. Translated from Latin, the title of the book is Theatre of the Art of Writing. It is an anthology of handwriting specimens by Solomon Henrix, van den Velde, Felix Van Sambix, Curione, M. Martine, Beauchesne, Houthusius, P. Goos, Jacomina Hondius, Peter Bales and other scribes. The book opens with a four page typeset instruction in the art of writing, and is followed by a series of 42 copperplate engravings. Each engraving is a specimen of roman, italic, blackletter, or Hebrew letters, usually accompanied by ornamental swashes, surrounded by an ornate cartouche. Each plate, or series of plates, is signed by its creator.  Media related to Theatrum artis scribendi at Wikimedia Commons
