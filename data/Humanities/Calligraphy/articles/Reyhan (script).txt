Reyhan (Arabic: ریحان‎) is one of the six canonical scripts of Perso-Arabic calligraphy. The word Reyhan means basil in Arabic and Persian. Reyhan is a variant of the Muhaqqaq script, but it is finer than Muhaqqaq, likened to flowers and leaves of basil.  It was developed during the Abbasid era by Ibn al-Bawwab.
