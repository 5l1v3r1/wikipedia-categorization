A khelrtva (Georgian: ხელრთვა) is a Georgian calligraphic monogram, seal or signature, originally used by the Georgian monarchs, queen consorts, patriarchs, royalty and nobility.    Word "khelrtva" literally means "to decorate, adorn or beautify with hand" in Georgian language, "kheli" meaning a hand and "rtva" meaning to decorate or adorn. Khelrtva signatures were written in one of the three Georgian scripts, mostly in Nuskhuri and Mkhedruli scripts, though the monograms especially the royal ones were written in Asomtavruli script. Every Georgian monarch had its own individual khelrtva and was known as "საუფლოჲ ხელი" (sauploy kheli) literally meaning "Hand of the Lord". Tradition of khelrtvas are still in use in Georgia.
