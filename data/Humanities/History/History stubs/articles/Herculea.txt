Herculea was a southern Italian colony of the classical Greek city Megara (or The Megarid) which was located on the isthmus across to the Peloponnese, adjacent to Corinth and Attica. Herculea, though not referred to often in the writings of historians at the time such as Herodotus and Thucydides, was a considerable step towards Mediterranean discovery and expansion for the more often than not isolationist Peloponnesian League related city/states.
