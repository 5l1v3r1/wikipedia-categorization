The Pensacola and Georgia Railroad was a 5 ft (1,524 mm)  broad gauge railroad line chartered in January 1853, which ran from Tallahassee, Florida east to Lake City, Florida by 1860, and west to Quincy, Florida by 1863.  Merged as one of two components within the Jacksonville, Pensacola and Mobile Railroad in 1869, the line ultimately came under the control of the Seaboard Air Line Railway (now CSX) in 1900.  In 1855, the P&G, as it was known, took over the Tallahassee Railroad, which ran south from Tallahassee to the port at St. Marks, Florida on the Gulf of Mexico. The P&G also constructed the Lloyd Railroad Depot and the Tallahassee station, both built in 1858 and still standing. The line thrived during the Civil War, in large part because of a branch line it constructed from its main line in Live Oak, Florida to Lawton (now Dupont), Georgia, where there was connecting service to Savannah.
