Ahmarian culture       was a Paleolithic archeological industry in Levant dated at 46,000-42,000 BP and  thought to be related to Levantine Emiran and younger European Aurignacian cultures. Ahmarian is considered to be the likely source of first modern humans who migrated to Europe to form Aurignacian culture known as Cro-Magnons. Although European Bohunician culture that may be linked to Emiran and Ahmarian itself and dated at 48,000 BP may predate it.
