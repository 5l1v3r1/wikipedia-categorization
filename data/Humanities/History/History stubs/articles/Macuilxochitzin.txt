Macuilxochitzin (c. 1435 - ?) was a poet, daughter of Tlacaélael, counselor to the Aztec "kings." There exists little information about the life of Macuilxochitzin. The poet was born in 1435 to a prominent family of Aztec nobility through her father Tlacaélael, who served as advisor to the tlatoanis. She had twelves siblings, each born to a different mother. Her name probably means, "Miss Five Flower," based on the Aztec, having been born on a 5 Flower day. However, other scholars argue that her name could be derived from the name of a goddess of the arts, songs and dance, once she was already a recognized poet. According to Miguel León Portilla in his book Fifteen Poets of the Aztec World, Macuilxochitzin lived in Mexico-Tenochtitlan in the fourteenth century, during the pinnacle of the Aztec civilization. The majority of her poetic work focused on the battles and confrontations that her father waged during the expansion of the Aztec empire across Mesoamerica. Only one poem that survives from that legacy can be attributed to her authorship and pertains to the decisive actions of a group of Otomi women who, through their prayers, saved the life of Tílatl, the Otomi captain that had been injured by a Mexica sovereign, during the conquest of Axayácatl where the indigenous groups, the Matlatzincas and Otomies, had settled in the Toluca Valley in 1476.
