Kalkarindji (formerly Wave Hill, also spelt Kalkiringi) is a small township in Northern Territory of Australia, located on the Buntine Highway. At the 2006 census, Kalkarindji together with Daguragu had a population of 544.  At the 2016 census, Kalkarindji by itself had a population of 334.  Daguragu, Kalkarindji and outstations had a population of 510.  Kalkarindji and the nearby settlement of Daguragu are the population centres of the land formerly held under the Wave Hill Cattle Station. In 1966, the indigenous station workers, led by Vincent Lingiari, staged a walk-off in protest against oppressive labour practices; following this, much of the land was returned to the Gurindji people by UK-based station owners The Vestey Group and the Australian Government in 1975.
