The Lageion (Greek:Λαγεῖον, translit: Layeῖon) also known as the Hippodrome of Alexandria, was a hippodrome situated in the city of Alexandria, Egypt, below the Serapeum. It is named after the founder of the Ptolemaic Dynasty of Egypt, Ptolemy I Soter.  The structure was covered up completely during the end of the 19th Century. The size of this structure is 615m with curvature on both ends and its tracks are 568m in length as indicated by the records during the Napoleonic expeditions. Records show that the Lageion was used as a stadium for athletic events and a hippodrome race course during the early Ptolemaic Period.
