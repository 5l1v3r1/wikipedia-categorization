The Rostock Inheritance Agreement (German: Rostocker Erbvertrag) describes several agreements reached by the Hanseatic city of Rostock with the dukes of Mecklenburg as landlords. The inheritance agreements should not be confused with the State Constitutional Inheritance Law (LGGEV) of 1755, which Duke  Christian Louis agreed with the estates (Landst√§nden) dominated by the knights' federation (Ritterschaft), which also included the city of Rostock. This led to a permanent involvement of the estates in the government of the state and from then on blocked constitutional development in the modern sense.
