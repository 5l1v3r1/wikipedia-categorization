Queen of the South (Greek: βασίλισσα νότου, basilissa notou) is an alternative title for the Queen of Sheba, used in two passages in the New Testament, where Jesus said: Occasionally, biblical translators have used the phrase "a Queen of the South",  the Greek having no article, but this has been criticized as incorrect.  The arrival of the Queen of Sheba (or “Queen of the South”) occurs in 1 Kings 10. The Queen had heard about Solomon’s fame and his relationship with the Lord, so she came to Solomon with a list of deep questions. According to the scriptural account, Solomon answered all her questions. The Queen believed as she received answers while face-to-face with Solomon. In the New Testament passages, Jesus refers to the Queen's arrival, saying that even she, being skeptical until she met with Solomon personally, will condemn the current generation for their lack of faith.
