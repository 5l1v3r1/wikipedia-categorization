Mulford Farm in East Hampton, Long Island, New York, is one of America's most significant, intact English colonial farmsteads.  The farmhouse was built in 1680 by High Sheriff Josiah Hobart, an important early official of the first New York Royal Province government.  Samuel "Fish Hook" Mulford bought the property in 1712 when Mr. Hobart died.  He had the barn built in 1721.  The property is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[discuss] The Mulford Farm site is interpreted as the year 1790, and includes the house, barn, spinning dependency, privy, smokehouse and garden. It is owned by the East Hampton Historical Society and operated as a living museum.  The museum is located at 10 James Lane, off Montauk Highway, East Hampton, New York.  It is open from Memorial Day weekend through Columbus Day weekend.  Media related to Mulford Farmhouse (East Hampton, New York) at Wikimedia Commons
