East Dane is an Anglo-Saxon ethnonym which was used in the epic Beowulf as a kenning for the Geats, the people of GÃ¶taland without Scania in southern Sweden. It was also used in an Anglo-Saxon runic poem describing the first appearance of the god Frey (called Ing, see Yngvi): In Scandinavian mythology (Ynglinga saga and Gesta Danorum), the first appearance of Frey was localised to Sweden and Old Uppsala, where he founded the Temple at Uppsala: The Ynglinga saga: Gesta Danorum: Since Dane was used as a generic expression for Scandinavian, it can be hypothesized that the name East Dane of the runic poem refers to Scandinavians living east of the Danes proper (i.e. Swedes and Geats).
