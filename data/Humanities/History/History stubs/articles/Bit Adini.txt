Bit Adini, a city or region of Syria, called sometimes Bit Adini in Assyrian sources, was an Aramaean state that existed as an independent kingdom during the 10th and 9th centuries BC, with its capital at Til Barsib (now Tell Ahmar).  In 856 BC, the kingdom was conquered and absorbed into the Assyrian Empire during the reign of Shalmaneser III. It is usually thought to have been in the bend of the Euphrates River, south of Carchemish.
