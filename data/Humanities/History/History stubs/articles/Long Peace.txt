"Long Peace" is a term for the historical period following the end of World War II in 1945.  This period of Cold War (1945â€“1991) was marked by the absence of major wars between the great powers of the period, the United States and the USSR.     Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the rise of China as a major power, there has followed more than a quarter of a century of continued absence of direct conflict between major states, though lesser military conflicts have occurred. It is speculated that the obvious political errors leading to World War I and World War II with their consequent horrors and, thereafter, the acquisition of thermonuclear weapons by the opposing powers exerted a restraining influence on the leaderships of the major powers.
