Strangeways is an area of inner north Manchester, England, around Strangeways Prison just north of the city centre. Until the 19th century, Strangeways was rural, with Strangeways Hall, Park and Gardens. Strangeways was recorded in 1322 as Strangwas, from the Anglo-Saxon Strang and gew√¶sc meaning "[a place by] a stream with a strong current".  HM Prison Manchester (commonly known as Strangeways) is a high-security men's prison operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service. It is a local prison, holding prisoners remanded into custody from courts in the Manchester area and Category A prisoners whose escape would be highly dangerous. Strangeways was designed by Alfred Waterhouse and opened in 1868 alongside the demolished Manchester Assize Courts. The prison is known for its prominent ventilation tower and imposing design, structured by the principles of the separate system. It was rebuilt following a major riot in 1990. Strangeways Brewery was famous as the home of Boddingtons Bitter. It closed in 2005 and was demolished in 2007.
