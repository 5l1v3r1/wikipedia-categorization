Marinus of Thrace (floruit c. 385 until 420–423 at latest)  was briefly undisputed Arian Archbishop of Constantinople, before being displaced by Dorotheus of Antioch. Thenceforth Marinus withdrew from communion with those Arians who followed Dorotheus and, with a group of followers who grew numerous enough to be considered a distinct sect of Arians, maintained a rival network of churches and oratories. The sect held, in contrast to the Arians under Dorotheus, that 'the Father had always been the Father, even when the son was not.'  The sect became known as the Psathyrians as one of its most prominent champions, one Theoctistus, was by profession a cake-seller (ψαθυροπώλης). The schism between the sects would be healed by the former consul Plinta during the reign of Theodosius II. Marinus of Thrace succeeded Demophilus, the leader of the Arians at Constantinople; but he was superseded by Dorotheus, who soon after arrived from Antioch in Syria, and who was considered by his sect to be better qualified for the office than Marinus.
