Shortugai (Shortughai) was an Indus civilization trading colony established around 2000 BC on the Oxus river near the lapis mines in northern Afghanistan.   According to Sergent, "not one of the standard characteristics of the Harappan cultural complex is missing from it".  It is considered to be the northernmost settlement of the Indus Valley Civilization.   The town consists of two hills called A and B by the excavators. One of them was once the town proper, the other one the citadel. Each of them is about 2 hectares large. Typical finds of the Indus Valley Civilization include one seal with a short inscription,  clay models of cattle with carts  and painted pottery.  Pottery with Harappan design, jars, beakers, bronze objects, gold pieces, lapis lazuli beads, other types of beads, drill heads, shell bangles etc. are other findings.  Square seals with animal motiff and script confirms this as a site belonging to Indus Valley Civilisation (not just having contact with IVC).   Bricks had typical Harappan measurements. A ploughed field with flax seeds in this site indicate dry land farming and irrigation canals dug to bring water from Kokcha (25Â km distance) also indicate efforts put in agriculture.  Shortugai was a trading post of Harappan times and it seems to be connected with lapis lazuli mines located in the surrounding area.  It also might have connections with tin trade (found at Afghanistan) and camel trade.
