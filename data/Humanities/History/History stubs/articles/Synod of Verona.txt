The Synod of Verona was held November 1184 under the auspices of Pope Lucius III and the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I.   The meeting was to address numerous issues. Some of these were; dispute over claims between empire and papacy in central Italy,  proprietary concerns of the bishopric of Gurk,  plans for a crusade to the Holy Land,  dispute over the investiture of the anti-Archbishop of Trier, Rudolf of Wied,  and the condemnation of heresy.  Though Lucius and Frederick were able to agree on Gurk, a new crusade and heresy issues,   the remaining issues were left unsettled.  The most significant event of the synod was the declaration of the papal bull Ad abolendam  and the joint condemnation of Arnoldists, Cathars, Humiliati, Josephini, Patarenes, Passagini, and Waldensians as heretics.
