Guarionex (Taíno language: "The Brave Noble Lord" ) was a Taíno cacique from Maguá in the island of Hispaniola at the time of the arrival of the Europeans to the Western Hemisphere in 1492.  He was the son of cacique Guacanagaríx, the great Taíno prophet who had the vision of the coming of the Guamikena (White Men). Since 1494 the Spaniards had imposed heavy tributes on the Taino population of Hispaniola. In 1495, Taino led by Caonabo raised up in arms but were crushed by Bartholomew Columbus. Guarionex then opted for accommodation and appeasement but by 1497 the situation had deteriorated further. Guarionex then sided with Spanish rebel Francisco Roldán and set out to attack the Spaniards. Columbus assembled his troops and attacked Guarionex's camp at night by surprise. The cacique was captured and his warriors dispersed. Guarionex was later released by Columbus and went back to his policy of appeasement. At one point he could not hold to power and fled to the north of the island. The Spaniards captured him there and sent him in chains to Spain in 1502, but the ship sank during a storm.   Lost was a fortune in gold said by Bartolomé de las Casas to be worth 3600 castilians.
