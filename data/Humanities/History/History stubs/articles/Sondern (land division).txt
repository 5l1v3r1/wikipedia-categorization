Sondern or Sundern was a type of land segregation in the Middle Ages in Germany, especially in North Rhine-Westphalia. It gave personal entitlement to farm specific areas of land without owning the land.  A KÃ¶nigssondern (royal sondern) is land whose use was administered by the Crown. The term is still found in many place names, indicating the history of the locality.
