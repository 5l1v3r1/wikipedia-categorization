Bavaria Slavica is a historiographic term used denote the areas populated by West Slavic people (Wends) between 6th and 12th century in Northeastern Bavaria. The Wends settled in Bavaria in several waves between the 6th and ninth centuries and later in the 10th/11th century. The settlement of loyal West Slavic Wends (and other minor) tribes was favoured under Frankish emperor Charlemagne.  Later the East Frankish Empire also settled largely Christianized Wends in rural or unpopulated regions or regions threatened by uprisings. After the migration stopped they were quickly assimilated by the local Franks, who had always continued to form the majority, and by Bajuvarians.
