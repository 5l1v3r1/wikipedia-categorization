Shunamitism is the practice of an old man sleeping with, but not necessarily having sex with, a young virgin to preserve his youth.  The rationale was that the heat and moisture of the young woman would transfer to the old man and revitalize him.  The term is based on the Biblical story of King David and Abishag, a young woman from Shunem.  When King David was old and could not stay warm, his servants found Abishag to sleep with him, though he had no intimate relations with her: therefore, she was still a virgin.  Among scientific physicians, both Thomas Sydenham (17th century) and Herman Boerhaave (18th century) prescribed shunamitism for their patients. Rejuvenation (aging)
