Echetlaeus (Greek: Ἐχετλαῖος) or Echetlus (Greek: Ἔχετλος) was an ancient Athenian mythical hero of the  Battle of Marathon with the Persians of the Achaemenid Empire. The latter name was also the name of a hero of ancient Thebes. The following tradition was current in ancient Athens after the Battle of Marathon.  During the battle, a man appeared among the Athenians, who resembled a rustic, and slew many of the Persians with his plough. After the battle, he disappeared. When the Athenians searched for him, they couldn't find him anywhere.When they consulted the oracle, they were commanded to worship the hero Echetlaeus, that is the hero with the echetlon, or ploughshare.  This Echetlus was depicted in the painting which represented the Battle of Marathon in the Stoa Poikile (Painted Porch), erected during the 5th century BC and located in the Ancient Agora of Athens. The Stoa Poikile was one of the most famous sites in ancient Athens, due to its display of war-related paintings and loot. In addition, in the play Seven Against Thebes, Echetlus is the name of one of the defenders of Thebes. He is killed when the seven attacked the city.   This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Smith, William, ed. (1870). "article name needed".
