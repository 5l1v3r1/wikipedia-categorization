A family history society is a society, often charitable or not-for-profit, that allows member genealogists and family historians to profit from shared knowledge.  Large societies often own libraries, sponsor research seminars and foreign trips, and publish journals. Some societies concentrate on a specific niche, such as the family history of a particular geographical area, ethnicity, nationality, or religion.  Lineage societies are societies that limit their membership to descendants of a particular person or group of people of historical importance.
