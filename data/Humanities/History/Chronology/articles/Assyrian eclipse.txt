The Assyrian eclipse, also known as the Bur-Sagale eclipse, is a solar eclipse recorded in Assyrian eponym lists, most likely dating the ninth year of the reign of king Ashur-dan III.  The eclipse is identified with the one that occurred on 15 June 763 BC (proleptic Julian calendar). The entry is short and reads: The phrase used — shamash ("the sun") akallu ("bent", "twisted", "crooked", "distorted", "obscured") — has been interpreted  as a reference to a solar eclipse since the first decipherment of cuneiform in the mid 19th century. The name Bur-Sagale (also rendered Bur-Saggile, Pur-Sagale or Par-Sagale) is the name of the limmu official  in the eponymous year. In 1867, Henry Rawlinson identified near-total eclipse of 15 June 763 BC as the most likely candidate (the month Simanu corresponding to the May/June lunation),   visible in northern Assyria just before noon.  This date has been widely accepted ever since;  the identification is also substantiated by other astronomical observations from the same period.  This record is one of the crucial pieces of evidence providing an absolute chronology of the Ancient Near East for the Assyrian period.
