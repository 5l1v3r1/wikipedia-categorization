The term originated with a scholiast on <a href=\"/wiki/Thucydides\" title=\"Thucydides\">Thucydides</a>, who used it in their description of the period. The <i>Pentecontaetia</i> was marked by the rise of <a href=\"/wiki/Classical_Athens\" title=\"Classical Athens\">Athens</a> as the dominant state in the Greek world and by the rise of <a href=\"/wiki/Athenian_democracy\" title=\"Athenian democracy\">Athenian democracy</a>. Since Thucydides focused his account on these developments, the term is generally used when discussing developments in and involving Athens.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Shortly after the Greek victory of 479 BC, Athens assumed the leadership of the <a href=\"/wiki/Delian_League\" title=\"Delian League\">Delian League</a>, a coalition of states that wished to continue the war against Persia. This league experienced a <a href=\"/wiki/Wars_of_the_Delian_League\" title=\"Wars of the Delian League\">number of successes</a> and was soon established as the dominant military force of the <a href=\"/wiki/Aegean_Sea\" title=\"Aegean Sea\">Aegean</a>.  Athenian control over the league grew as some \"allies\" were reduced to the status of tribute-paying subjects and by the middle of the 5th century BC (the league treasury was moved from <a href=\"/wiki/Delos\" title=\"Delos\">Delos</a> to Athens in 454 BC) the league had been transformed into an Athenian empire.  Athens benefited greatly from this tribute, undergoing a <a href=\"/wiki/Fifth_Century_Athens\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Fifth Century Athens\">cultural renaissance</a> and undertaking massive public building projects, including the <a href=\"/wiki/Parthenon\" title=\"Parthenon\">Parthenon</a>; Athenian democracy, meanwhile, developed into what is today called radical or <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Periclean_democracy&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Periclean democracy (page does not exist)\">Periclean democracy</a>, in which the popular <a href=\"/wiki/Ecclesia_(ancient_Athens)\" title=\"Ecclesia (ancient Athens)\">assembly of the citizens</a> and the large, citizen juries exercised near-complete control over the state.\n</p><p>The later years of the <i>Pentecontaetia</i> were marked by increasing conflict between Athens and the traditional land powers of Greece, led by <a href=\"/wiki/Sparta\" title=\"Sparta\">Sparta</a>. Between 460 BC and 445 BC, Athens fought a shifting coalition of mainland powers in what is now known as the <a href=\"/wiki/First_Peloponnesian_War\" title=\"First Peloponnesian War\">First Peloponnesian War</a>. During the course of this conflict, Athens gained and then lost control of large areas of <a href=\"/wiki/Central_Greece\" title=\"Central Greece\">central Greece</a>.  The conflict was concluded by the <a href=\"/wiki/Thirty_Years%27_Peace\" title=\"Thirty Years&#39; Peace\">Thirty Years' Peace</a>, which lasted until the end of the <i>Pentecontaetia</i> and the beginning of the Peloponnesian War.\n</p><p>The eventual breakdown of the peace was triggered by increasing conflict between Athens and several of Sparta's allies. Athens' alliance with <a href=\"/wiki/Corcyra\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Corcyra\">Corcyra</a> and attack on <a href=\"/wiki/Potidaea\" title=\"Potidaea\">Potidaea</a> enraged <a href=\"/wiki/Corinth\" title=\"Corinth\">Corinth</a>, and the <a href=\"/wiki/Megarian_decree\" title=\"Megarian decree\">Megarian decree</a> imposed strict economic sanctions on Megara, another Spartan ally.  These disputes, along with a general perception that Athenian power had grown too powerful, led to the breakdown of the Thirty Years Peace; the Peloponnesian War broke out in 431 BC.\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Timeline_of_the_Pentecontaetia_(480\u2014431)\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Timeline of the Pentecontaetia (480\u2014431)</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Democracy_in_Athens_during_the_Pentecontaetia\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Democracy in Athens during the Pentecontaetia</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Increasing_Tensions_Leading_to_War\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Increasing Tensions Leading to War</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Notes\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Notes</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Timeline_of_the_Pentecontaetia_.28480.E2.80.94431.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Timeline_of_the_Pentecontaetia_(480\u2014431)\">Timeline of the Pentecontaetia (480\u2014431)</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Pentecontaetia&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Timeline of the Pentecontaetia (480\u2014431)\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><b>479</b>\u2014Rebuilding of Athens: Although the Greeks were victorious in the Persian War, many Greeks believed that the Persians would retaliate. This led Athens to rebuild its long walls that were razed by the Persian Army during the occupation of <a href=\"/wiki/Attica\" title=\"Attica\">Attica</a> in 480.\n</p><p><b>478</b>\u2014Formation of the Delian League: Athens and other city states form a coalition against Persia.\n</p><p><b>477</b>\u2014The Conquest of Eion: <a href=\"/wiki/Cimon\" title=\"Cimon\">Cimon</a>, the son of Miltiades of Marathon fame, led Athens to numerous victorious campaigns and war profits. In 477, he led an army against Persian-occupied Eion in northern Greece. Athens was able to benefit from this invasion since the region was rich in timber, which was critical to building Athens' burgeoning naval fleet.\n</p><p><b>476</b>\u2014The Conquest of Scyros: The invasions continued with success on a par with Cimon's prior campaigns. In 476, Athens fought against the pirates of Scyros, as the Delian League wanted to reduce piracy around the region and capture the important materials for itself.\n</p><p><b>469</b>\u2014Operation in Asia Minor and the Battle of Eurymedon: From the beginning of 469 to 466, the Delian league led an army to <a href=\"/wiki/Asia_Minor\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Asia Minor\">Asia Minor</a> against Persia. Cimon persuaded Greek settlements on the Carian and Lycian coast to rebel against Persia. This led the Persian army to mobilize a force to fight Cimon in the <a href=\"/wiki/Battle_of_Eurymedon\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Battle of Eurymedon\">Battle of Eurymedon</a> in <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Pamphylsia&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Pamphylsia (page does not exist)\">Pamphylsia</a>. Cimon was able to swiftly defeat the Persian army and the war profits were used to finance Athens' city walls.\n</p><p><b>465</b>\u2014Operations in Northern Greece: Athens' powers and desire for expansion grow. In 465, after <a href=\"/wiki/Cleruchy\" title=\"Cleruchy\">cleruchizing</a> the Chersonese, they tried to gain control of <a href=\"/wiki/Thasos\" title=\"Thasos\">Thasos</a>. Thucydides wrote that Sparta contemplated an invasion of Attica in order to help free Thasos. However, in the aftermath of a catastrophic earthquake and subsequent helot uprising in Sparta, no attack\u2014if indeed such was projected\u2014was launched.\n</p><p><b>461</b>\u2014The Debate in Athens over Helping Sparta: With a legion of <a href=\"/wiki/Helot\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Helot\">Helots</a> rebelling against Sparta, Athens offered Sparta their help by sending a force of 4,000 <a href=\"/wiki/Hoplite\" title=\"Hoplite\">Hoplites</a> to suppress the rebels. According to Thucydides, Sparta decided to dismiss Cimon's Athenian Army, because they felt that Athens would convince the Helots on <a href=\"/wiki/Ithome\" title=\"Ithome\">Ithome</a> to form a coalition and besiege Sparta. Spartans did not feel comfortable with such a large Athenian force inside their city. If the Athenians were to turn their backs on Sparta, the city would not be able to protect itself. At this point, Sparta acknowledged that Athens might be getting too powerful. According to Thucydides, the Athenians were deeply offended by their removal from Ithome. They denounced their original treaty with Sparta made during the Greco-Persian Wars, then proceeded to make an alliance with <a href=\"/wiki/Argos\" title=\"Argos\">Argos</a>, a major enemy of the Spartans. \n</p><p><b>460</b>\u2014Athens' Clash with Corinth over Megara: Megarians joined the Delian League due to a war between Megara and Corinth. This angered the Corinthians. Even using Athens' weakest soldiers, being the old and young men who were left behind in the city, they were able to win the war against Corinth with ease.\n</p><p><b>460</b>\u2014The Athenian Expedition to Egypt: Athens led a coalition with the Egyptians to rebel against Persia. However, their six-year expedition did not lead to much success against Persia, as 100 Athenian ships were destroyed in the Delta region.\n</p><p><b>458</b>\u2014The Long Walls: The construction of the long walls gave Athens a major military advantage by forming a barrier around the city-state and its harbors, which allowed their ships to access waterways without threat from outside forces. Two walls were constructed from the city to the sea, one to <a href=\"/wiki/Phaleron\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Phaleron\">Phaleron</a> and the other to <a href=\"/wiki/Piraeus\" title=\"Piraeus\">Piraeus</a>. Athens relied on these long walls to protect itself from invasion, while sending off its superior vessels to bombard opponents' cities.\n</p><p><b>458</b>\u2014The Battle of Tanagra: According to Thucydides, Spartans aided the Dorians by invading Greece, because they were motivated by ethnic solidarity. Sparta sent out 1500 Hoplites and an additional 10,000 from their allies' forces to suppress the Phocians' Army invading Doris. The Spartans were victorious, but they found themselves stuck in this foreign land. Athens, suspecting a plot by the Spartans to overthrow the democracy and to prevent the building of the Long Walls, then attacked the Spartans at Tanagra in <a href=\"/wiki/Boeotia\" title=\"Boeotia\">Boeotia</a> with a force of 14,000. The Spartans were victorious in this battle.\n</p><p><b>457</b>\u2014The Battle of Oenophyta: After the Spartans returned home from Tanagra, the Athenians conquered Boetia and <a href=\"/wiki/Phocis\" title=\"Phocis\">Phocis</a> after a battle at <a href=\"/wiki/Oenophyta\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Oenophyta\">Oenophyta</a>.

City-states such as Megara and Euboea began to rebel against Athens and the Delian League when the Spartan Army invaded Athenian territory.\n</p><p><b>445</b>\u2014The Thirty-Year Peace Between Athens and Sparta: After losing Attica, Boeotia and Megara, Athens agreed to a thirty-year peace in return for all the conquered areas in the Peloponnesian region. From this point on, all future conflicts between Athens and Sparta were resolved under arbitration.\n</p><p><b>447</b>\u2014Athenian Colonization and the Colony of Brea: With the 30-year peace treaty, Athens was able to concentrate attention towards growth rather than war. From 447-445, the Delian League was able to influence city-states near the Mediterranean to join and pay tribute (phoro). This helped the region because the tributes paid by each and every city-state were reduced with the increasing number of members joining the league.\n</p><p><b>441</b>\u2014The Samian Revolt\u2014Athens decided to besiege <a href=\"/wiki/Samos\" title=\"Samos\">Samos</a> after their revolt in 441. However, Persia decided to take the opportunity to support Samos even though they have signed the Peace of Callias with Athens. Athens would eventually spend 1200 talents to fund the war through the Delian League's treasury. Some scholars believed that Sparta might have aided Samos as well, but decided to pull out, having they signed the Thirty-year peace treaty.\n</p><p><b>437</b>\u2014The Foundation of Amphipolis: With vast resources, especially timber for ship building, Athens founded the city of <a href=\"/wiki/Amphipolis\" title=\"Amphipolis\">Amphipolis</a> on the Strymon River. Amphipolis was immensely important to Athens since it controlled many trading routes.\n</p><p><b>432</b>\u2014The Potidaean Affair: Athens was threatened by the possibility of a revolt, plotted by Corinth and <a href=\"/wiki/Macedon\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Macedon\">Macedon</a>. After fighting in Macedon, which ended when the two countries came to terms with each other, Athens came to Potidaea. They had previously demanded that Potidaea tear down their long walls and banish Corinth ambassadors. However, by the time Athens reached Potidaea, the residents were in full revolt and prepared to fight Athens with support from the Corinthian army. The Corinthians was also able to influence the Spartans to join the cause, since Sparta didn't want to lose such an affluent ally. The fighting concluded with an Athenian victory. \n</p><p><b>432</b>\u2014The Megarian Decree: With Sparta's aid, Megara urged Athens to drop their decree against them since it was hurting their economy; they were forbidden to use Athen's markets and harbors. Athens claims that Megarians insulted them by trespassing on land sacred to <a href=\"/wiki/Demeter\" title=\"Demeter\">Demeter</a> and murdering an Athenian ambassador. However, most scholars believe it was an act of vengeance when Megara revolted during the early parts of the Pentecontaetia.\n</p><p><b>432</b>\u2014Peloponnesian War\u2014This marked the end of the Pentecontaetia, as Athens and Sparta engaged in all-out war, which eventually led to the demise of the Athenian Empire.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Democracy_in_Athens_during_the_Pentecontaetia\">Democracy in Athens during the Pentecontaetia</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Pentecontaetia&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Democracy in Athens during the Pentecontaetia\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>After the exile of Cimon in Athens, his rivals <a href=\"/wiki/Ephialtes\" title=\"Ephialtes\">Ephialtes</a> and Pericles implemented democratic social reforms. In 462, Ephialtes challenged the <a href=\"/wiki/Areopagus\" title=\"Areopagus\">Areopagus</a>, claiming that they were abusing their powers. Part of the reform was to introduce \"<a href=\"/wiki/Graphe_paranomon\" title=\"Graphe paranomon\">graphe paranomon</a>\" or public protest against illegal decrees. Any citizen would have the right to challenge a previous degree instilled by the Areopagus and claim it as invalid. The assembly would have to conduct a \"dokimasia\" or examination of state officials before they enter office. Opportunities for citizens to join the office were increased tremendously when 500 members were added. Transferring the powers of the Areopagus to all Athenian citizens enabled a more democratic society. \n</p><p>These democratic ideals are reflected in the use of personal names without a <a href=\"/wiki/Patronymic\" title=\"Patronymic\">Patronymic</a> on inscriptions of casualty lists from around this time, such as those of the tribe <a href=\"/wiki/Erechtheis\" title=\"Erechtheis\">Erechtheis</a> dated to 460/459BC <sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> and the Argive dead at the <a href=\"/wiki/Battle_of_Tanagra_(457_BC)\" title=\"Battle of Tanagra (457 BC)\">Battle of Tanagra (457 BC)</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>.

This first-hand experience allows a look into the mind of a person at the center of the ordeal. The conflict between Athens and Sparta is in Thucydides\u2019 eyes an inevitable confrontation of the two major powers. The beginning of this tension begins during the incipient stages of the Athenian empire following the defeat of Persia during a period called the \u201cpentekontaetia\u201d. The pentekontaetia began in 479 and ended with the outbreak of war. With great confidence in their military abilities, perhaps a bit of instilled machoism, and the need for an anti-Persian alliance, Athens begins recruiting various Greek city-states into an alliance called the <a href=\"/wiki/Delian_League\" title=\"Delian League\">Delian League</a>. The growth of Athenian power through the <a href=\"/wiki/Delian_League\" title=\"Delian League\">Delian League</a> is centered on a growing navy, the rebuilding of the walls that protect the city from land-based attackers, and an aggressive push to extend their influence which included a few skirmishes with other powers. <a href=\"/wiki/Thucydides\" title=\"Thucydides\">Thucydides</a> writes about how this period of growth was an inevitable cause of war, \u201cTheir supremacy grew during the interval between the present war and the Persian wars, through their military and political actions recounted below against the barbarians, against their own allies in revolt, and against the Peloponnesians whom they encountered on various occasions.\u201d (1.97 [2])\n</p><p>Athenian naval supremacy was a great fear of <a href=\"/wiki/Sparta\" title=\"Sparta\">Sparta</a> and her allies. While the Spartans combat prowess was unmatched on land, when it came to the sea <a href=\"/wiki/Athens\" title=\"Athens\">Athens</a> was the clear victor. This split seemed to have already been accepted by the Spartans many years earlier, however the aggressiveness and effectiveness of Athenian naval warfare had yet to be fully realized. According to <a href=\"/wiki/Thucydides\" title=\"Thucydides\">Thucydides</a> following the defeat of <a href=\"/wiki/Persia\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Persia\">Persia</a>, Athens begins to reconstruct the long walls which connected the main city of Athens to the port of <a href=\"/wiki/Piraeus\" title=\"Piraeus\">Piraeus</a> around 478.  \u201cSpartan feeling was at that time very friendly towards <a href=\"/wiki/Athens\" title=\"Athens\">Athens</a> on account of the patriotism which she had displayed in the struggle with Mede. Still the defeat of their wishes could not but cause them secret annoyance.\u201d (1.92 [1]) The Spartan annoyance stems partly from the long walls being a major deterrent to land based, non-siege tactics which the Spartans were particularly adept at, but also from the way in which the deal was brokered.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Thucydides\" title=\"Thucydides\">Thucydides</a> writes of <a href=\"/wiki/Themistocles\" title=\"Themistocles\">Themistocles</a>, an envoy to <a href=\"/wiki/Sparta\" title=\"Sparta\">Sparta</a>, who in 479 changed the tide of history by hiding the facts regarding the construction of the walls around <a href=\"/wiki/Athens\" title=\"Athens\">Athens</a> and those of the <a href=\"/wiki/Piraeus\" title=\"Piraeus\">Piraeus</a>. In Themistocles\u2019speech to the Spartan assembly Thucydides points out that at this point Athenian independence was highlighted. \u201cWherever they had deliberated with the Spartans, they had proved themselves to be in judgment second to none.\u201d (1.91 [5]) This is an important step because Themistocles articulates that Athens is an independent state with its own agenda that brushed over that of others. This is a very important point in the lead up to the <a href=\"/wiki/Peloponnesian_War\" title=\"Peloponnesian War\">Peloponnesian War</a> because one man is credited with making the split. <a href=\"/wiki/Themistocles\" title=\"Themistocles\">Themistocles</a> through his cunningness asserts an independent and strong Athenian identity. He makes it clear after the walls have been secured (ensuring Athenian strength) that Athens is independent and is making self-interested decisions.
