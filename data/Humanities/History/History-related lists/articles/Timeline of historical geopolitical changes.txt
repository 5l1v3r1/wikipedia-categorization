Through the knowledge of such dates and events, the approximate year and age of a world map could be calculated and estimated. Not all maps of the world of an age or period will be the same throughout the globe as different mapmakers (or their employers) may have different views on the sovereignty or territorial integrity of the countries of the world or possess different levels of technological and geographical insight, the maps created by them might differ significantly.

Thus, while the 2000s began on Saturday, January 1, 2000 CE, the official Third Millennium began on Monday, January 1, 2001 CE.
