The 2017 Bojangles' Southern 500, the 68th running of the event, was a Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series race held on September 3, 2017 at Darlington Raceway in Darlington, South Carolina. Contested over 367 laps on the 1.366-mile (2.198 km) egg-shaped oval, it was the 25th race of the 2017 Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series season. Darlington Raceway is a race track built for NASCAR racing located near Darlington, South Carolina. It is nicknamed "The Lady in Black" and "The Track Too Tough to Tame" by many NASCAR fans and drivers and advertised as "A NASCAR Tradition." It is of a unique, somewhat egg-shaped design, an oval with the ends of very different configurations, a condition which supposedly arose from the proximity of one end of the track to a minnow pond the owner refused to relocate. This situation makes it very challenging for the crews to set up their cars' handling in a way that is effective at both ends. Kyle Larson was the fastest in the first practice session with a time of 28.415 seconds and a speed of 173.064 mph (278.520 km/h).  Kyle Busch was the fastest in the final practice session with a time of 28.373 seconds and a speed of 173.320 mph (278.932 km/h).  Kevin Harvick scored the pole for the race with a time of 27.669 and a speed of 177.730 mph (286.029 km/h).
