The T. S. Ashton Prize, established with funds donated by the late Professor T. S. Ashton (1889-1968), is awarded biennially by the Economic History Society to the author of the best article accepted for publication in the Economic History Review in the previous two calendar years, who satisfies at least one of the following conditions at time of submission: The prize is currently £750. The December 1968 issue of the Review carried a brief obituary of Professor T. S. Ashton (1889-1968) by A. H. John and a flier announcing the intention to establish the Prize, initially endowed by Mrs Ashton with the sum of £500. Further donations were sought from EHS members and an initial prize suggested of £50, to be awarded annually. The Prize was formally announced in the April 1970 issue of the Review. In 1981, the value of the Prize was raised to £150, with the intention of making an award every other year. The value was raised to its current value of £750 in 1998. Note: The Economic History Society's archives at the London School of Economics include a file, 'Correspondence relating to the TS Ashton Prize, 1971-82.'
