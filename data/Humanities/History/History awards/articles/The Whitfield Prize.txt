The Whitfield Prize (or Whitfield Book Prize) is a prize of £1000 awarded annually by the Royal Historical Society to the best work on a subject of British or Irish history published within the United Kingdom or Republic of Ireland during the calendar year. To be eligible for the award, the book must be the first history work published by the author.  The prize was founded in 1976 out of the bequest of Archibald Stenton Whitfield. Originally, the prize was £400; five years later, it was increased to £600.   Currently, the prize is £1000. Source: Royal Historical Society
