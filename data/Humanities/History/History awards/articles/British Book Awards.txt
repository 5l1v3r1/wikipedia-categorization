The British Book Awards or Nibbies are literary awards for the best UK writers and their works, administered by The Bookseller. The awards have had several previous names, owners and sponsors since being launched in 1990, including the National Book Awards from 2010-2014. The British Book Awards or Nibbies ran from 1990–2009 and founded by the editor of Publishing News.  The award was then acquired by Agile Marketing which renamed it the National Book Awards with headline sponsors Galaxy National Book Awards (2010–11) (sponsored by Galaxy) and Specsavers National Book Awards (2012-2014) (sponsored by Specsavers).   There were no National Book Awards after 2014.  In 2017 the award was acquired by The Bookseller and renamed to the original British Book Awards or Nibbies..  In 2005, The Bookseller launched a separate scheme, The Bookseller Retail Awards (winners not listed in this article). In 2010, running parallel to the National Book Awards, The Bookseller combined The Nibbies with its retail awards to produce The Bookseller Industry Awards (winners not listed in this article). In 2017 The British Book Industry Awards were renamed as The British Book Awards after it acquired the National Book Awards from Agile Marketing.  It is known as the Nibbies because of the golden nib-shaped trophy given to winners.  Prior to 2010 the Best was a unique winner. Starting in 2010, the Best was chosen by the public via open internet vote from among one of the winning books in the other categories.  Previously called British Children's Book of the Year.
