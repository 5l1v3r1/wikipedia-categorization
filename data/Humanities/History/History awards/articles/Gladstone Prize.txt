The Gladstone Prize is an annual prize awarded by the Royal Historical Society to debut authors for a history book published in Britain on any topic which is not primarily British history.  The prize is named in honour of William Ewart Gladstone and was made possible by a grant by the Gladstone Memorial Trust. It was first awarded in 1998, the centenary of Gladstoneâ€™s death.
