The Dexter Award was an honor given out by the American Chemical Society from 1956 until 2001. It was sponsored by the Dexter Chemical Corporation except for the final two years, when it was sponsored by the Mildred and Sidney Edelstein Foundation. The award was established to recognize an "outstanding career of contributions to the history of chemistry".
