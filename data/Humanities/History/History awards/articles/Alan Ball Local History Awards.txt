The Alan Ball Local History Awards in the United Kingdom exist to recognise outstanding contributions in local history publishing (both in print and in new media), and to encourage the publishing of such works by public libraries and local authorities.  The awards were established in the 1980s  and are run by the Library Services Trust.  They are named after the local history author and former chief librarian of the Harrow and Home Counties libraries.  A maximum of three awards are made each year.  The following is the partial list of award winners.
