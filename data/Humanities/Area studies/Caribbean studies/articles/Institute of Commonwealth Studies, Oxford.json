The Institute of Colonial Studies had been established in 1945. Its antecedent had been the training courses at the <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_Oxford\" title=\"University of Oxford\">University of Oxford</a> for both the probationers of the <a href=\"/wiki/Indian_Civil_Service\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Indian Civil Service\">Indian Civil Service</a> and the <a href=\"/wiki/Colonial_Service\" title=\"Colonial Service\">Colonial Services</a> (such as the Tropical African Service Course). More directly it had developed out of the University\u2019s response to a proposed expansion, to be made in the post-war years, in the training of colonial civil servants. These proposals were eventually published as the Report on Post-War Training for the Colonial Service (Devonshire Report, 1946). Much of the drafting of the report had been undertaken by <a href=\"/wiki/Margery_Perham\" title=\"Margery Perham\">Margery Perham</a>, then Reader in Colonial Administration at Oxford, who had also been influential in establishing the Committee for Colonial Studies, the Institute\u2019s supervising body, in 1943. The Institute was set up under the directorship of Perham, assisted by Col. F.B.H. Drummond as administrative secretary who also acted as secretary to the Committee. In 1948 both Perham and Drummond resigned and the Institute\u2019s affairs were placed in the hands of a Committee of Management, consisting of the Beit Professor of Commonwealth History (then, of the History of the British Empire), the Registrar and the Reader in Colonial Administration, who continued to run the Institute until Bullard's appointment as Director in 1951. The Institute, initially located at 10 Bardwell Road, Oxford, moved in 1948 to premises in South Parks Road, in 1951 to 10 Keble Road, and in 1961 to Queen Elizabeth House (21 St Giles). It continued in existence until 1986, when it was amalgamated with the Institute of Agricultural Economics and Queen Elizabeth House to form a centre for Third World Development Studies.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Past_directors\">Past directors</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Institute_of_Commonwealth_Studies,_Oxford&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Past directors\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Directors of the Institute of Commonwealth Studies (to 1956, of Colonial Studies):\n</p>\n<dl><dd>1945\u201348 Dame <a href=\"/wiki/Margery_Perham\" title=\"Margery Perham\">Margery Perham</a></dd>\n<dd>1948\u201351 <i>Committee of Management</i></dd>\n<dd>1951\u201356 Sir <a href=\"/wiki/Reader_Bullard\" title=\"Reader Bullard\">Reader Bullard</a></dd>\n<dd>1957\u201361 <a href=\"/wiki/Elizabeth_Millicent_Chilver\" title=\"Elizabeth Millicent Chilver\">Elizabeth Millicent Chilver</a></dd>\n<dd>1961\u201368 A.F.M.
