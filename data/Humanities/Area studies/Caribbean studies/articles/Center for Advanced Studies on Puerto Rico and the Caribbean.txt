The Center for Advanced Studies on Puerto Rico and the Caribbean (Centro de Estudios Avanzados de Puerto Rico y El Caribe) is a private research institute in Old San Juan, San Juan, Puerto Rico that offers graduate studies in arts and philosophy. It was incorporated on February 28, 1968 by Pablo Casals, Luis Muñoz Marín, Roberto Busó Carrasquillo, and Jaime Benítez. However, it remained inactive and without organization until 1976, when Ricardo Alegría made a request before the Council on Higher Education of Puerto Rico to transform the center into an academic institution. The center is currently accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools. Coordinates: 18°28′00″N 66°07′08″W﻿ / ﻿18.466702°N 66.118767°W﻿ / 18.466702; -66.118767
