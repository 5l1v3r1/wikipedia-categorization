Eurasian Geography and Economics is an academic journal in economic and political geography as well as in macroeconomics of the Eurasian continent, published in association with the Kennan Institute for Advanced Russian Studies. With an impact factor consistently higher than 1, it ranks first in the Area Studies category in the ISI classification. The bimonthly journal publishes empirical papers by scholars affiliated with The Brookings Institution, Russian Academy of Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, as well as major university and research organizations in North America, Western Europe, and Japan. First published in 1960 as Soviet Geography, it went through a series of name changes: Post-Soviet Geography (1992-1995); Post-Soviet Geography and Economics (1996-2002); and, since 2002, Eurasian Geography and Economics. In the 1990s, the journal expanded from its original concentration on the Soviet Union and began to incorporate empirical studies of China, Europe, and such turbulent Asian countries as Iran and Afghanistan. A 1980 University of Chicago survey showed that the journal generated more citations than any other geographic periodical in the world.   Subsequently, the journal was ranked first among 106 geographic periodicals judged on the basis of citations.
