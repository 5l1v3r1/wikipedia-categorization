Launched in 2006, the British Scholar Society is currently chaired by Martin Farr of Newcastle University. The chair of its advisory board is Linda Colley of Princeton University. The British Scholar Society describes its membership as "people from around the world who share a common interest in Britain, its history, and its interactions with the wider world."
