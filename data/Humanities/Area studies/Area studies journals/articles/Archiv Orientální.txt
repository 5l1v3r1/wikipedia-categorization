The Archiv Orientální (ArOr) is a triannual peer-reviewed academic journal covering African, Asian, and Near Eastern studies. It is currently published by John Benjamins Publishing Company on behalf of the Czech Academy of Sciences. The journal serves a forum for the publication of research dedicated to the cultures and societies of Asia and Africa, past and present. Each issue is divided into three sections according to region: Near East and Africa, South and Central Asia, and the Far East. The current editor-in-chief is Táňa Dluhošová (Czech Academy of Sciences).  Archiv Orientální was founded by the Oriental Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences in 1929 by Bedrich Hrozný with an endowment from the country's president, Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk, on the occasion of his seventieth birthday anniversary. According to the 1st Issue published in 1929:  The aim of the Czechoslovak Oriental Institute (Orientální ústav) in Prague (Praha) which has been found (sic) by the munificent endowment of the President of the Czechoslovak Republic, T. G. Masaryk, on the occasion of his seventieth birthday anniversary, is to start and keep scientific and economic relation with the Orient. Two departments of the Oriental Institute have been inaugurated, viz., 1.) the Research department and 2.) the Economic department. In the first meetings of the Research department, assembled for the purpose of laying down principles of the programme of the Institute, it has appeared, that a periodical in which oriental research will be dealt with would be the best medium to realize the said programme. Thus the Archiv orientální, of which the first issue is herewith presented to the public, has been started.  Archiv Orientální is abstracted and indexed in the Arts and Humanities Citation Index , ERIH PLUS, and Scopus.
