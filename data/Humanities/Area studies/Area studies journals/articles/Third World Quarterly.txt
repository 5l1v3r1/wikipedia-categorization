Third World Quarterly is a peer-reviewed academic journal published by Routledge, established in 1979. As of  2017[update], its editor-in-chief is Shahid Qadir. It was published eight times per year until 2011, when publication increased to ten times per year.  It is now published monthly.  According to the Journal Citation Reports, the journal had an impact factor of 1.451 in 2014, ranking it 35th out of 55 journals in the category "Planning and Development".  In September 2017, the journal attracted controversy after it published an article entitled "The Case for Colonialism" by political scientist Bruce Gilley. This was described by Portia Roelofs and Max Gallien of the London School of Economics as "a travesty, the academic equivalent of a Trump tweet, clickbait with footnotes."  On 19 September 2017, a large number of the journal's editorial board resigned in protest, citing a flawed peer review process for the colonialism submission and inaccurate statements from the editor-in-chief, Shahid Qadir.  In all, 15 of the 34 members of the international editorial board were signatories to the resignation letter. A petition at Change.org to retract the piece had more than 10,000 supporters.
