The Falkland Islands Journal is an annual academic journal covering all aspects of research on the Falkland Islands. It was established in 1967.  The first editor-in-chief was W.H. Thompson, Colonial Secretary to the Falkland Islands Government, who in the first issue wrote that "(t)he idea behind the Journal is to promote interest in the Falkland Islands and their history. Editorial policy is to publish items of interest from the past and present. Politics do not come into it."  Since 1990, the editor has been Jim McAdam (Queens University Belfast).
