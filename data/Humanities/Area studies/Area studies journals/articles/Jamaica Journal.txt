The Jamaica Journal is an academic journal published by the Institute of Jamaica in Kingston, Jamaica. It publishes scholarly articles on the history, natural history, art, literature, music, and culture of Jamaica. The Jamaica Journal's predecessor was the Journal of the Institute of Jamaica, established in 1896. In 1967, the Jamaica Journal was established  as a quarterly journal, "to reflect the Institute's interest in the development and promotion of Jamaica's history, literature, science and arts". In 2002, the Jamaica Journal temporarily ceased publication; it was relaunched in 2004 under a new editor-in-chief, Kim Robinson-Walcott.
