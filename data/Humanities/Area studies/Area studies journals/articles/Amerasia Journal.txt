Amerasia Journal is an interdisciplinary academic journal covering Asian American studies. It was established in 1971 by editor-in-chief Lowell Chun-Hoon, publisher Don Nakanishi, and members of the Yale University Asian American Students Association. Chun-Hoon and Nakanishi were both seniors and members of Yale's Class of 1971. The first issue was released in March, 1971. The journal was moved to the Asian American Studies Center (AASC) at the University of California, Los Angeles in July, 1971, when Chun-Hoon became a staff member at the Center. It was a joint publication of the AASC and the Yale Asian American Students Association until 1973, when it became solely owned by the AASC. The current editor-in-chief is David K. Yoo (AASC). Its issues frequently address one theme and have included "Asian America and Same-Sex Marriage",  "Word Travels: Asian American Literature in China, Italy, Sweden, Germany, Poland, Singapore, and the U.S.",  and "Crime in Asian America".
