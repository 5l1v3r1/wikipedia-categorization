The Information Society in Latin America This research program concentrates on the impact of new information and communications technology on the transformation of Latin America's education system, public space and democratic life.   Recently the Edelstein Center has completed a research on the use of computers and Internet by public school teachers in Rio de Janeiro.  The study indicates that even when they have a positive impact, they cannot be separated from the educational and human context. A comprehensive policy needs to properly training teachers, in particular confronting the difficulties of the older generation, use monitored software, and adequate maintaining the physical infrastructural and technical support for school computer labs. Civil Society and Globalization Agendas The Civil Society and Globalization Agendas research program focuses on the current changes in Latin America’s civil society. Civil society played an important role in the promotion of democracy during the period of military dictatorships. However, more recently, civil society organizations have expanded and changed profoundly. While continuing to play an important role in the defense of human rights, in many countries civil society has become a vehicle for  political parties, individual politicians, unions and social movements to channel public funds for their own benefit and/or political cooptation.
