Large-scale new migration augmented their numbers during the 1910s, as Mexico was torn by a high-casualty civil war. Until the 1960s, most lived within a few hundred miles of the border, although some resettled along frail lines from the Southwest to the Midwest.\n</p><p>More recently, Mexican Americans have diffused throughout the U.S., especially in the Midwest and Southeast, with the largest numbers in California and Texas. In the past hundred years Mexican-Americans have campaigned for voting rights, stood against educational, employment, and ethnic discrimination and stood for economic and social advancement. At the same time many Mexican-Americans have struggled with defining and maintaining their community's identity. \nIn the 1960s and 1970s, some Hispanic student groups flirted with <a href=\"/wiki/Nationalism\" title=\"Nationalism\">nationalism</a> and differences over the proper name for members of the community of <a href=\"/wiki/Chicano\" title=\"Chicano\">Chicano/Chicana</a>, Latino/Latina, Mexican-Americans, Hispanics or simply <a href=\"/wiki/La_Raza\" title=\"La Raza\">La Raza</a> became tied up with deeper disagreements over whether to integrate into or remain separate from <a href=\"/wiki/Anglo\" title=\"Anglo\">Anglo</a> society, as well as divisions between those Mexican-Americans whose families had lived in the United States for two or more generations and more recent immigrants.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources.

The systematic <a href=\"/wiki/Navajo_people\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Navajo people\">Navajo</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Apache\" title=\"Apache\">Apache</a> raids on <a href=\"/wiki/History_of_New_Mexico\" title=\"History of New Mexico\">New Mexico</a> villages and ranches were ignored, as was the vulnerability of California, as the central government pulled back its soldiers to use them in recurrent civil wars and factional battles. After armed uprisings in <a href=\"/wiki/Republic_of_Texas\" title=\"Republic of Texas\">Texas</a> Mexico's President <a href=\"/wiki/Antonio_L%C3%B3pez_de_Santa_Anna\" title=\"Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna\">Santa Anna</a> led an army to put down the rebellion. After initial victories at The Alamo and Goliad, Santa Anna was decisively defeated by the Texans, who declared independence. The Tejanos in Texas joined the revolution and supported the new Republic of Texas; The Hispanics in New Mexico and California were localistic and did not identify with the regime in Mexico City. The \"norte\u00f1os\" played a minor role in the <a href=\"/wiki/Mexican%E2%80%93American_War\" title=\"Mexican\u2013American War\">Mexican\u2013American War</a> of 1846\u201348, and when offered the choice of repatriating to Mexico or remaining and becoming full citizens of the United States, the great majority remained. Only when large numbers of Americans arrived did they develop a sense of \"lo mexicano,\" that is of \"being Mexican,\" and that new identification had little to do with far-off Mexico.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> American entrepreneurs often cultivated alliances and partnerships with the Mexican propertied elites in the states of Texas and California, and the territories of New Mexico and Arizona. The Californios\u2014who only numbered 10,000 in 1848, remained in California but were soon overwhelmed by the immigration of hundreds of thousands of newcomers to California, and largely became invisible to Anglos. The Latino culture of the rest of the Southwest, especially New Mexico and southern Texas, called itself \"Spanish\" (rather than \"Mexican\") to distinguish themselves from \"los norteamericanos\". The Latinos emphasized their own religion, language, customs and kinship ties, and drew into enclaves, rural colonies and urban barrios, which norteamericanos seldom entered; intermarriage rates were low.\n</p><p>Beginning in the 1820s, immigrants from the U.S. and Europe settled in Texas (Tejas), then part of Mexico. Anglo and Hispanic Texas joined to fight Mexico in 1836, defeating an invading army and declaring the independence of Texas. The Texas Republic included Tejanos as leading citizens, but Mexico refused to recognize its legal existence. The US annexed Texas in 1845, leading to the <a href=\"/wiki/Mexican%E2%80%93American_War\" title=\"Mexican\u2013American War\">Mexican\u2013American War</a> of 1846\u201348. While there were some Americans who considered the war with Mexico illegal and immoral, others considered it part of <a href=\"/wiki/Manifest_Destiny\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Manifest Destiny\">Manifest Destiny</a>\u2014the American destiny to pursue the war. This policy claimed that it was the United States' right to expand westward across North America and settle the land.\n</p><p>The Americans won easily and the war ended with the <a href=\"/wiki/Treaty_of_Guadalupe_Hidalgo\" title=\"Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo\">Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo</a>. In the Treaty Mexico gave up more than 500,000 square miles of territory, which today comprises Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Utah, and parts of Colorado and Wyoming. The United States in 1853 purchased the <a href=\"/wiki/Gadsden_Purchase\" title=\"Gadsden Purchase\">Gadsden Purchase</a>, a strip of land in southern New Mexico and Arizona that provided a route for a railroad.\n</p><p>The result was unchallenged American control over a wide range of territory once held by Mexico, including the present day states of Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, Arizona, and California. The vast majority of Hispanic populations chose to stay and become full US citizens. By and large, the Hispanic populations of these areas supported the new government. The Mexican government had become despotic under on-and-off-again President <a href=\"/wiki/General_Santa_Anna\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"General Santa Anna\">General Santa Anna</a>, and the US Government offered protection from Indian raids that Mexico had not prevented, meaning an end to civil wars of the sort that continuously wracked Mexico until 1920, and it promised much greater long-run prosperity.\n</p><p>Although the treaty promised that the landowners in this newly acquired territory would enjoy full enjoyment and protection of their property as if they were citizens of the United States, many former citizens of Mexico lost their claims in lawsuits before state and federal courts. Even those statutes intended to protect the owners of property at the time of the extension of the United States' borders, such as the 1851 California Land Act, had the effect of dispossessing <a href=\"/wiki/Californio\" title=\"Californio\">Californio</a> owners ruined by the cost of maintaining litigation over land titles for years.\n</p><p>After the Santa Fe Ring succeeded in dispossessing thousands of landholders in New Mexico, groups such as <a href=\"/wiki/Las_Gorras_Blancas\" title=\"Las Gorras Blancas\">Las Gorras Blancas</a> tore down fences or burned down interlopers' farm buildings. In western Texas the political struggle sparked an <a href=\"/wiki/San_Elizario_Salt_War\" title=\"San Elizario Salt War\">armed conflict</a> in which the Tejano majority forced the surrender of the <a href=\"/wiki/Texas_Ranger_Division\" title=\"Texas Ranger Division\">Texas Rangers</a>, but in the end lost their influence, offices, and economic opportunities.\n</p><p>In other areas, particularly California, the Hispanic residents were simply overwhelmed by the number of Anglo settlers who rushed in, first in Northern California as a result of the <a href=\"/wiki/California_Gold_Rush\" title=\"California Gold Rush\">California Gold Rush</a>,<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> then decades later by the boom in Southern California. Anglo miners drove Hispanic miners out of their camps, barred non-Anglos from testifying in court and imposed exclusionary standards similar to what was called <a href=\"/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws\" title=\"Jim Crow laws\">Jim Crow</a> in the case of African-Americans.<sup id=\"cite_ref-encyclopedia.com_3-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-encyclopedia.com-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> Some Hispanics, of whom <a href=\"/wiki/Joaquin_Murietta\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Joaquin Murietta\">Joaqu\u00edn Murieta</a> was a legendary example and <a href=\"/wiki/Tiburcio_Vasquez\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Tiburcio Vasquez\">Tiburcio V\u00e1squez</a> a real one, responded by resorting to banditry. During the Gold Rush, there was an immigration of Mexican miners to California.\n</p><p>About 20,000 Tejanos lived in South Texas in the 1850s. The social structure has been analyzed by historian Randolph Campbell:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p><i>South Texans of Hispanic descent lived in a three-tiered society during the antebellum years. At the top stood the landed elite, the owners of huge ranches, many of which originated as haciendas in the Spanish colonial period. The elite based their economic lives on cattle raising. They sold some cattle in Mexico and Louisiana and exported hides and tallow, but access to major urban markets outside the region was so limited that South Texas ranchers did not develop highly commercial operations during the antebellum years. This apparently suited most very well anyhow in that they viewed their ranches primarily as a way of life rather than a business investment and therefore focused on keeping their property intact as well as turning a profit....</i><sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup></p></blockquote>\n<p>Small landowners occupied the second rung of the South Texas economic and social ladder. These rancheros, as they were called, lived in one-room adobe houses and spent most of their time caring for their small herds of horses and cattle. Although a smaller part of the population, they can be compared, it seems, to the plain folk Anglos of East Texas. That is, they differed from the elite only in the extent of their property, not in their dependence on the land or the way they tried to live.\n</p><p>Finally, South Texas had a lower class composed primarily of pe\u00f3ns, vaqueros, and cartmen. Pe\u00f3ns had a status above that of the slaves in antebellum Texas but below that of genuinely free men. They owned no property, could not travel or call in a doctor without the permission of the estate owner (the patr\u00f3n), and needed his approval for marriages. When a pe\u00f3n was accused of an offense, the patr\u00f3n acted as judge and jury. On the other hand, pe\u00f3ns were not property and therefore could not be bought and sold or treated as personal chattels in any way. Somewhere in an ill-defined place between that of slaves and free men, they served as \u201cfaithful servants\u201d to the upper class.\n</p><p>Pe\u00f3ns worked at the direction of the patr\u00f3ns\u2014planting and harvesting crops, herding goats, digging wells, and doing any sort of manual labor necessary. In return they received wages or credits at the estate's store in amounts so small that they were constantly in debt. They lived in tiny one-room jacales, huts with walls of mud or any other material available and thatched roofs. The one room served for both living and sleeping; cooking and eating took place in a separate enclosure made of grass or corn stalks.\n</p><p>The poor, landless class also included vaqueros, the men who herded and took care of cattle. Ranch owners and mission priests generally considered it beneath their dignity to do such work and thought of these first Texas cowboys simply as laborers riding horses. No one involved could have imagined that millions of Americans would one day see working cattle as an ultimately romantic and heroic part of Texas's past. At least vaqueros, as befitted their future image, had more independence than pe\u00f3ns. They were not bound to the land and could even expect to acquire property of their own someday.\n</p><p>Cartmen lived in San Antonio or along the route from that city to Indianola and earned their living by transporting food and merchandise from the coast to the interior. Using oxcarts, they virtually monopolized this particular freight route by moving goods quickly and cheaply. Anglo competitors appeared by the 1850s but were unable to match the rates charged by the Tejanos. Carting appears to have been the most lucrative business open to poorer Tejanos during these years.\n</p>\n<blockquote><p><i>In parts of south Texas and southern Arizona, Hispanic Americans were able to obtain positions within local government while in New Mexico Hispanic Americans remained an absolute majority of the population until the end of the 19th century. The federal government delayed granting statehood to New Mexico because of its Hispanic American political leadership.</i><sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup></p></blockquote>\n<p>Despite integration, Hispanic Americans managed to retain their <a href=\"/wiki/Spanish_language\" title=\"Spanish language\">Spanish language</a> and culture. They were most successful in those areas where they had retained some measure of political or economic power, where Jim Crow laws imposed a forced isolation or where immigrants from Mexico made up a significant percentage of the community.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Anti-Mexican_American_violence_.281840s_to_1900s.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Anti-Mexican_American_violence_(1840s_to_1900s)\">Anti-Mexican American violence (1840s to 1900s)</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=History_of_Mexican_Americans&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Anti-Mexican American violence (1840s to 1900s)\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The lynching of Mexicans and Mexican Americans in the Southwest has long been overlooked in American history. This may be due to the fact that most historical records categorized Mexicans, Italians, Native Americans, and sometimes Chinese lynching victims as white.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> It is estimated that at least 597 Mexican Americans were lynched between 1848 and 1928.

The employment needs of the railroad industry in the late 19th century brought Mexican immigrants from more remote regions of Mexico, while the new systems integrated the border regions of the United States and Mexico. The railroad also led to the economic development of those parts of the US, drawing Mexican immigrants in large numbers into agriculture in the early 20th century, establishing a pattern that continued thereafter.\n</p><p>These largely male Mexican immigrants also established <i>colonias</i> in the early 20th century in places such as <a href=\"/wiki/Chicago\" title=\"Chicago\">Chicago</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri\" title=\"Kansas City, Missouri\">Kansas City</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Salt_Lake_City,_Utah\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Salt Lake City, Utah\">Salt Lake City, Utah</a> as railroad employment took them further within the United States.

This large wave of Mexican immigration are attracted to low-paid labor jobs and an equally high number moved to low-income communities, such as industrial suburbs of <a href=\"/wiki/Los_Angeles,_California\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Los Angeles, California\">Los Angeles</a> in ethnic neighborhoods known as <i>barrios</i> and the agricultural sector of <a href=\"/wiki/Imperial_Valley_(California)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Imperial Valley (California)\">Imperial Valley</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/California\" title=\"California\">California</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Early_20th-century_Texas\">Early 20th-century Texas</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=History_of_Mexican_Americans&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Early 20th-century Texas\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In Texas, people of Hispanic ethnicity, most of whom were Mexican nationals, began arriving in greater numbers between 1900 and 1930. Adding to the number of older Hispanic residents already in Texas, some of whom had been here since the Spanish Colonial Era, many of these new immigrants engaged in cotton production by performing the back-breaking work of hoeing cotton fields clean of weeds and harvesting the mature crop during the summer and fall. These resilient people established themselves in communities where earlier Hispanics already existed. From settlements in The Rio Grande Valley, in South Texas, communities in the Nueces Strip-between Three Rivers and Corpus Cristi, Texas-and the interior city of San Antonio, Hispanics ventured outward following the maturing cotton crop north and west. They traveled by extended family groups on an odyssey known as \"The Big Swing\". Along the route some younger family members might land a permanent job and stay behind. From Lubbock to San Angelo, Hispanics now form an integral part of their local communities.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\".22Nuevomexicanos.22_in_New_Mexico.2C_1900.E2.80.931930\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"&quot;Nuevomexicanos&quot;_in_New_Mexico,_1900\u20131930\">\"Nuevomexicanos\" in New Mexico, 1900\u20131930</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=History_of_Mexican_Americans&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: &quot;Nuevomexicanos&quot; in New Mexico, 1900\u20131930\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Hispanics living in New Mexico were relegated to second-class social status by the socio economically dominant non Hispanic population. Some of these \"Anglos\" deprecated Hispanic/Mexican culture. and questioned the native populations fitness for democracy.

Like the \"new immigrants\" in eastern cities who also constructed dual identities, members of the Nuevomexicano middle class exuberantly participated in the war effort. They melded images of their heritage with patriotic symbols of America, especially in the Spanish-language press.

For Anglos, on the other hand, it was a useful term that upgraded the state's image, for the old image as a \"Mexican\" land suggested violence and disorder, and had discouraged capital investment and set back the statehood campaign.
