The Institute of Latin American Studies (ILAS) was established in 1965 at the University of London, with the objective of providing a focus for research on the literature, history, politics and economics of Latin America and the Caribbean. Between 2004 and 2013, the ILAS formed part of the Institute for the Study of the Americas (ISA), along with the Institute of United States Studies (IUSS). In August 2013, ILAS was re-established to focus solely on supporting research on Latin America and the Caribbean.  Located in Senate House, ILAS is one of ten institutes that together comprise the School of Advanced Study, University of London. The national and international mission of ILAS is to support researchers engaged in scholarship in the humanities broadly defined pertaining to Latin America and the Caribbean by building and maintaining national scholarly networks; hosting visiting fellows; hosting and promoting academic events; and providing digital resources of use for the research community. The Instituteâ€™s focus is multidisciplinary and, as part of the School of Advanced Study, benefits from academic collaboration across a wide range of subject fields in the humanities and social sciences. Further, ILAS works closely with cultural, diplomatic and business organizations with an interest in Latin America.
