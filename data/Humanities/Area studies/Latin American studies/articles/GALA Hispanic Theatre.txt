GALA Hispanic Theatre is a theater located at 3333 14th St NW in Washington, D.C. It hosts plays in Spanish and English, as well as dance, music, poetry, spoken word, art and films.     The GALA Hispanic theatre was founded in 1976 by Hugo and Rebecca Read Medrano and their supporters with the aim of preserving and promoting Hispanic language and culture. There are many theaters in Washington, D.C., but there was not one for Hispanics until the opening of GALA. Their playwrights and their actors are of Hispanic heritage, hailing from countries including Argentina, Mexico, Spain, Chile, Uruguay, Paraguay, and Peru. In 2015, Gala was awarded the 50/50 Applause Award by The International Center for Women Playwrights, for having more than 50% of its plays written by female playwrights. The GALA Hispanic Theatre was given an award by the King of Spain, Carlos I, in 2008, in recognition of their promotion and dissemination of Spanish culture in the US.
