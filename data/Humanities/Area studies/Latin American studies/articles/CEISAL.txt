CEISAL (in Spanish Consejo Europeo de Investigaciones sobre Am√©rica Latina) is a network of the main institutes and specialised centres in Latin American studies, and national associations of social research on Latin America in Europe.  It consists of 51 members representing 19 European countries. It is a  plural and critical space for reflection from the different fields in Social Sciences in order to broaden the knowledge of the social, cultural, economic and political realities.    CEISAL was founded in 1971 in Westphalia. At that time it was an initiative that tried to bring closer relations between Western and Eastern Europe.  Its main objective was to promote academic freedom and the exchange of thought that would contribute to the development of studies on Latin America in Europe. 24 research and teaching institutions from 8 western countries participated in its founding together with other institutes in Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia. CEISAL holds annual assemblies. On the occasion of the celebration of the VIII Centenary of the University of Salamanca, it was celebrated in that historic city in 2016,  and the General Assembly elected a new Directive Committee.
