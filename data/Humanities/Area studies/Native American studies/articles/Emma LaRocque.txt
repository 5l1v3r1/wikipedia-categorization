Emma LaRocque (born 1949) is a Canadian academic of Cree and MÃ©tis descent. She is currently a professor of Native American studies at the University of Manitoba. LaRocque was born in the remote community of Big Bay, Alberta, near the town of Lac La Biche. She came from a family of fur trappers, and was one of the first in her family to receive a formal education.  LaRocque worked as a teacher at the Janvier 194 reserve until 1971, when she moved to the United States to attend Goshen College, Indiana.  She graduated with a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree in 1973, and later attended the Anabaptist Mennonite Biblical Seminary, graduating with a Masters of Arts in peace studies in 1976.  Before entering academia herself, she briefly worked as a reporter and editor for Native People, a newspaper published by the  Alberta Native Communications Society.  LaRocque joined the University of Manitoba faculty in 1976, and received a second M.A. in 1980, in Canadian history. She completed a doctorate in 1999, on the subject of "Aboriginal resistance literature".  In 1975, LaRocque published an influential handbook for educators of First Nations students, titled Defeathering the Indian. She argued that First Nations students had been the subject of "psychological violence", which could only be countered if cultural and individual stereotyping was removed.  LaRocque published a second book, When the Other is Me, in 2010, exploring the response of indigenous writers to racism in non-indigenous literature. It won the Isbister Award for Non-Fiction at the 2011 Manitoba Writing and Publishing Awards.  She is also a published poet, writing brief, imagist poems about her ancestral land and culture.
