The Indispensable Enemy: Labor and the Anti-Chinese Movement in California (ISBNÂ 978-0520029057) is a labor and California history book by Alexander Saxton  which became one of the founding texts of Asian American studies.  The book has been described as "represent[ing] the best example of writing in the historical materialist tradition within Asian American Studies"  and "[t]he model of historical writing" that discusses both the "history of workers and racism", both interracial "unity but also the limits of that unity."
