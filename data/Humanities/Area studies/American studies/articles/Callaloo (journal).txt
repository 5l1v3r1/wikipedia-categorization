Callaloo, A Journal of African Diaspora Arts and Letters, is a quarterly literary magazine that was established in 1976  by Charles Rowell, who remains its editor-in-chief. It contains creative writing, visual art, and critical texts about literature and culture of the African diaspora, and is probably the longest continuously running African-American literary magazine.  In addition to receiving grants of support from national agencies such as the Lannan Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts, Callaloo has garnered a number of national honors, including the best special issue of a journal from the Council of Editors for Learned Journals for "The Haitian Issues" in 1992 (volume 15.2 & 3: Haiti: the Literature and Culture Parts I & II); an honorable mention for the "Best Special Issue of a Journal" in 2001 from the Professional/Scholarly Publishing (PSP) Division of the American Association (volume 24.1: The Confederate Flag Controversy: A Special Section); and recognition for the Winter 2002 issue from the Council of Editors for Learned Journals as one of the best special issues of that year (volume 25.1: Jazz Poetics).
