A complementary series of biennial conferences sponsored by these centers fostered a community of scholars, activists, artists, publishers, and journalists invested in the study of and advocacy for working-class life, culture and interests.\n</p><p>The Youngstown Center for Working-Class Studies (CWCS) was the first multi-disciplinary academic center in the US devoted to the study of working-class culture broadly defined. What distinguished the center was an <a href=\"/wiki/Interdisciplinarity\" title=\"Interdisciplinarity\">interdisciplinary</a> approach to the study of <a href=\"/wiki/Working_class\" title=\"Working class\">working-class</a> issues.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> The center was launched in 1996 after a group of Youngstown faculty organized two interdisciplinary conferences in the early 1990s, one on the 1930s and the next on working-class studies, and received a grant from the <a href=\"/wiki/Association_of_American_Colleges_and_Universities\" title=\"Association of American Colleges and Universities\">Association of American Colleges and Universities</a> to explore the category of class as part of a broader project promoting diversity on college campuses. Under the leadership of co-founders Sherry Linkon and John Russo, the center supported a range of activities promoting awareness of and respect for working-class life and culture, including an educational program in collaboration with Local 1375 of the <a href=\"/wiki/United_Steelworkers\" title=\"United Steelworkers\">United Steelworkers</a> that brought college classes to the union hall.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> This work, in addition to continuing biennial conferences on working-class studies, was further supported by two grants from the <a href=\"/wiki/Ford_Foundation\" title=\"Ford Foundation\">Ford Foundation</a> starting in 2000.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The Center for Study of Working Class Life was established in 1999 at SUNY Stony Brook under the leadership of <a href=\"/wiki/Economist\" title=\"Economist\">economist</a> Michael Zweig. Like the Youngstown center, The Center for Study of Working Class Life took an interdisciplinary approach to investigating the meaning of class in contemporary society, although with a stronger emphasis on \u201ctools of the social sciences.\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>  Starting in 2002, their How Class Works conference became the biennial complement to the Youngstown center\u2019s working-class studies conference. The Youngstown conference met every other odd year, and How Class Works met every other even year, multiplying opportunities for cross-disciplinary interaction and collaboration.\n</p><p>The Working-Class Studies Association began to develop in early 2003 in the course of planning that year\u2019s Youngstown conference.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> In April 2004, Linkon and John Russo met with 15 participants to develop a <a href=\"/wiki/Mission_statement\" title=\"Mission statement\">mission statement</a>, map out the structure of the organization, and work through organizing issues.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> The group included academics and graduate students from multiple fields as well as independent scholars and labor educators.\n</p><p>The organization held a founding meeting at Stony Brook in June 2004, setting the stage for its first official business meeting at Youngstown in May 2005.<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> The constitution and a slate of candidates for the steering committee were presented at this meeting.
