The Digital Himalaya is a project that was founded in December 2000 by Alan Macfarlane and Mark Turin. The main purpose of the project is to preserve old digital materials near the Himalayas, such as photographs, recordings, and journals, and make those resources available over the internet and on DVD. When established in 2000, Digital Himalaya project had three primary objectives:  Five ethnographic collections representing a broad range of regions, ethnic groups, time periods, and themes were selected for digitisation in the first phase of the project, along with a set of maps of Nepal and important journals on Himalayan studies.
