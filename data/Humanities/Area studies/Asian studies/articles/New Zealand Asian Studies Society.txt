The New Zealand Asian Studies Society (NZASIA) is established in 1974. It is an independent academic society that seeks to encourage the spread of knowledge about Asia, its history, its culture, and its role in international affairs. The objectives of the NZASIA are to: i) contribute to the knowledge and understanding of Asian polities, societies and civilis-ations by fostering research by its members or others, through the holding of conferences and scientific meetings, through publications, periodicals and the like, through subsidising research and travel, and in any other ways howsoever; ii) disseminate knowledge of Asian polities, societies and civilisations in New Zealand by holding meetings and conferences, sponsoring publications, and establishing links amongst specialists in these fields and other educational, cultural and governmental institutions and their members, and amongst such specialists and news media; and iii) establish and maintain contacts with Societies of similar or related interests in Asia, Australia, America, Europe and elsewhere, by affiliation or otherwise. The society publishes the biannual journal New Zealand Journal of Asian Studies and a yearly newsletter. The NZASIA, in cooperation with the Asia:NZ Foundation, offers post-graduate scholarships to support research and fieldwork in Asia.
