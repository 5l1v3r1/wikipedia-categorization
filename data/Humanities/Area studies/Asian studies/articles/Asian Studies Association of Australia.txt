 The Asian Studies Association of Australia is a professional association for peak body of university experts and educators in Asian Studies in Australia. The association was established at a meeting held in Canberra during the ANZAAS Conference in January 1975 and adopted a constitution at its first National Conference in May 1976.  Membership is primarily drawn from the university sector and consists of individuals engaged in teaching or research in any field of Asian studies, including language teaching. Affairs of the association are administered by the executive committee, which consists of the president, vice-president, secretary, treasurer and publications officer. Policy of the association is determined by the council, which comprises the members of the executive committee, one member each representing the regions of Asia and three members elected as general representatives. The association holds a biennial national conference and since 1990 has published the Asian Studies Review.  Its monograph series have published a significant number of influential works in Asian studies. The ASAA makes regular submissions to governments and universities on matters relating to Asian studies, the professional interests of its members, tertiary and secondary education about Asia, and Asia-Australia relations.  A major report published in 2002, Maximizing Australia's Asia Knowledge, argued for increased government investment in Asian Studies.  The following have served as ASAA presidents: Anthony Low, Stephen Fitzgerald, Jamie Mackie, Elaine McKay, John Ingleson, Colin Mackerras, Beverly Hooper, Anthony Reid, Robert Elson, Tessa Morris-Suzuki, Robin Jeffrey, Robert Cribb, Michael Leigh, Kathryn Robinson, Purnendra Jain, Louise Edwards, and Kent Anderson.
