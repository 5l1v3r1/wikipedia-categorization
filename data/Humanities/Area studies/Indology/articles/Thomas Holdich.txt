 Colonel Sir Thomas Hungerford Holdich, KCMG, KCIE, CB (1843–1929) was an English geographer and president of the Royal Geographical Society. He is best known as Superintendent of Frontier Surveys in British India and author of numerous books, including The Gates of India, The Countries of the King's Award and Political Frontiers and Boundary Making. Born in Dingley, Northamptonshire, England to the Rev. Thomas Holdich, he was educated at Godolphin Grammar School and the Royal Military Academy, obtaining a commission in the Royal Engineers in 1862. He saw active service in the Bhutan expedition of 1865, the Abyssinian campaign of 1867-68 and the Second Afghan War of 1878-79. During peacetime, he was largely occupied with the survey of India, and served on the Afghan Boundary Commission of 1884-86, the Tasmar Boundary Commission of 1894, the Pamir Boundary Commission of 1895 and the Perso-Baluchistan Boundary Commission of 1896. He was also engaged in The Cordillera of the Andes Boundary Case by the governments of Argentina and Chile in 1902 to define the boundary along the  Andes Mountains. He was awarded the Founder's Gold Medal of the Royal Geographical Society in 1887 in recognition of his work on the Afghan frontier. On his retirement to half-pay in 1898, he thanked "that providence which had been good to me in that during that last year of my Indian career I had been able to put a round finish on the last of our frontier maps". He was placed on the Retired list with an Indian pension 13 February 1900.  In later years, he wrote and lectured extensively on geographical issues, and served as president of the Royal Geographical Society from 1917-19. He contributed a number of entries to the eleventh edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica. Boundaries are the inevitable product of advancing civilisation; they are human inventions not necessarily supported by nature's dispositions, and as such they are only of solid value so long as they can be made strong enough and secure enough to prevent  their violation and infringement. - Sir Thomas Hungerford Holdich (1916) Sir Thomas was married to Ada Vanrenen, and had two daughters and two sons. He died in 1929 at his home at Parklands in Merrow, Surrey, near Guildford, at the age of 86.
