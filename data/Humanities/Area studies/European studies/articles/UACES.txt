UACES, or the academic association for Contemporary European Studies, is a membership organisation for academics, students and practitioners in all fields of contemporary European studies and the study of the European Union. Its initialism derives from its previous name, "the University Association for Contemporary European Studies", which was amended when it registered as a Charitable Incorporated Organisation (CIO) on 1 December 2015.   It is widely known as the editor and disseminator of the Journal on Common Market Studies, a leading peer-reviewed academic journal in the field of European integration studies. Founded in 1967, UACES celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2017.     UCAES' Honorary President is Professor Dame Helen Wallace DBE CMG, and its notable patrons include Sir Stephen Wall and Paul Adamson OBE AcSS, amongst others.
