The early history <i><a href=\"/wiki/Shang_Shu\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Shang Shu\">Shang Shu</a></i> recorded the earliest forms of the \"five penalties\": <a href=\"/wiki/Tattoo\" title=\"Tattoo\">tattooing</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Disfigurement\" title=\"Disfigurement\">disfigurement</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Castration\" title=\"Castration\">castration</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Mutilation\" title=\"Mutilation\">mutilation</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Capital_punishment\" title=\"Capital punishment\">death</a>. Once written law came into existence, the meaning of <i>x\u00edng</i> was extended to include not only punishments but also any state prohibitions whose violation would result in punishments. In modern times, <i>x\u00edng'<a href=\"/wiki/Penal_law\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Penal law\">penal law</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Criminal_law\" title=\"Criminal law\">criminal law</a>. An example of the classical use of </i>x\u00edng<i> is </i>X\u00edng B\u00f9<i> (\u5211\u90e8, lit. \"Department of Punishment\") for the legal or justice department in imperial China.</i>\n</p><p>The two major Chinese philosophical schools discussed below, Confucianism and Legalism, strongly influenced the idea of law in China. Briefly, under Confucianism, the state should lead the people with virtue and thus create a sense of shame which will prevent bad conduct. Under Legalism, law is to be publicly promulgated standards of conduct backed by state coercion. The tension between these two systems is that Confucianism relies on tradition to make the leader the head of household of all China, while Legalism makes standard law that even the emperor should be bound by. The common factor is that both endorse to different degrees a paternalistic conception of the state, which knows better than its citizens and makes laws to protect them. This concept persisted throughout the imperial period, into the republican period, and can still be seen acting today.\n</p><p>Unlike many other major <a href=\"/wiki/Civilization\" title=\"Civilization\">civilizations</a> where written law was held in honor and often attributed to divine origin, law in early China was viewed in purely <a href=\"/wiki/Secular\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Secular\">secular</a> terms, and its initial appearance was greeted with hostility by Confucian thinkers as indicative of a serious moral decline, a violation of human morality, and even a disturbance of the total cosmic order.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> Historically, the people's awareness and acceptance of ethical norms was shaped far more by the pervasive influence of custom and usage of property and by inculcating moral precepts than by any formally enacted system of law. Early emperors however embraced the Legalist ideal as a way of exerting control over their large and growing territory and population. This process was integrated with traditional Chinese beliefs in the cosmic order, holding that correct behavior was behavior consonant with the appropriate responses set by <i>f\u01ce</i>. <i>X\u00edng</i> states the potential costs to the individual of exceeding them and imposes penalties for these actions.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The imperial period was characterized mainly by the concept of law as serving the state, a means of exerting control over the citizenry. In the late Qing dynasty there were efforts to reform the law codes mainly by importing German codes with slight modifications. This effort continued and was amplified in the republican period resulting in the Provisional Constitution of 1912 which included the idea of equality under the law, rights for women, and broader rights for citizens vis-\u00e0-vis the government. The onset of the communist period at first rolled back the development of individual rights with the primary concept of law returning to that of a tool of the state. After the Cultural Revolution devastated the ranks of intellectuals and legal professionals, it took until 1982 for the idea of individual rights to reemerge as a significant influence on Chinese law.\n</p><p>The current constitution, created in 1982, states in Article V that no organization or individual is above the law and in Article III makes the People\u2019s Congresses and state administration responsible to the people, paving the way for later efforts to allow enforcement of individual rights. Passage of the Administrative Litigation Law of 1987 created legal recourse for individuals from arbitrary government action, an avenue previously unavailable. Despite the deep-seated norm against legal proceedings, litigation in the Chinese courts has increased dramatically, especially in recent years. The continuing weakness of courts resulting from their dependence on the local government for financial support and enforcement undermines the effectiveness of these remedies but this has also begun to change with China\u2019s initiatives to increase legal training and the professionalism of the judiciary.\n</p><p>One avenue of individual appeal from government action which continues to be important is the custom of <i>x\u00ecnf\u01ceng</i> or petitions by citizens to the individuals officials for change. The continuing wide use of <i>x\u00ecnf\u01ceng</i> reflects the fact that many officials are still able to avoid legal sanctions and the underlying avoidance of the legal system, as well as the personal ability of officials to personally intervene to change unjust results. Recently <i>x\u00ecnf\u01ceng</i> has been institutionalized to some extent with the central government mandating that every level of administration establish a <i>x\u00ecnf\u01ceng</i> office to handle petitions and report them up to high levels. This solution by exertion of personal power clearly goes against the idea of rule of law, and worse, some scholars have noted that <i>x\u00ecnf\u01ceng</i> today functions more as an informational collection system for the government than an effective review mechanism.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Confucianism_and_Legalism\">Confucianism and Legalism</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Chinese_law&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Confucianism and Legalism\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/Confucianism\" title=\"Confucianism\">Confucianism</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Legalism_(philosophy)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Legalism (philosophy)\">Legalism</a> are two major Classical legal theories or philosophies developed during the Spring and Autumn period and the Warring States period, a time that saw the most impressive proliferation of new ideas and philosophies in Chinese history. While both theories call for governmental hierarchy, they differ drastically in their views of human potential and the preferred means to achieve political order. Nevertheless, both theories have influenced and continue to influence the development of cultural, social, and legal norms in China.<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Confucianism\">Confucianism</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Chinese_law&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Confucianism\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>The basic premise of Confucianism is the idea that human beings are fundamentally good. With this optimistic view on human potential, Confucius advocates for ruling through <i>li</i> \u2013 traditional customs, mores, and norms \u2013 which allow people to have a sense of shame and become humane people with good character, rather than through government regulations and penal law. The idea is that people will internalize the acceptable norms and only take proper actions. This will not only lead to a harmonious social order, but it will also provide the additional benefit of improving an individual\u2019s inner character and the overall quality of the society. In contrast, codified laws require external compliance, and people may abide by the laws without fully understanding the reason for compliance. As such, a social order achieved through formal laws does not come with the additional benefit of better citizenry. It is worth noting, however, that even Confucius did not advocate for the elimination of formal laws. Rather, according to Confucius, laws should be used minimally and reserved only for those that insist on pursuing one\u2019s self-interests without taking into account the well being of the society.\n</p><p>As Confucius rejects the general use of formal laws to achieve social order, what lies vital to Confucius\u2019 theory is the willing participation by citizens of the society to search for commonly accepted, cooperative solutions. In addition to willing participation of citizens, there must also be grounds or bases upon which commonly acceptable solutions can be arrived at \u2013 the concept known as <i>li</i>. <i>Li</i> is commonly understood as a set of culturally and socially valued norms that provide guidance to proper behaviors that will ultimately lead to a harmonious society. These norms are not fixed or unchangeable over time but rather a reflection of what is accepted at a particular time in a particular context. When conflicts arise, the <i>li</i> have to be applied and interpreted to produce a just result and restore the harmony of the society. However, in the absence of any procedural safeguard afforded by codified laws, interpretation of <i>li</i> is subject to abuse.\n</p><p>Recognizing that people in a society hold diverse interests, Confucius charges the ruler with the responsibility to unify these interests and maintain social order. This is not done by dictatorship but by setting an example. Therefore, a ruler needs not to force his people to behave properly. Instead, the ruler needs only to make himself respectful, and the people will be induced and enlightened by his superior virtues to follow his example \u2013 an ideal known as <i>w\u00faw\u00e9i</i>. Nevertheless, the ruler must know and understand the <i>li</i> to be able to create solutions to conflict and problems the society faces. As the people are to follow the moral standards and example set by the ruler, to a large extent, the quality of the ruler determines the quality of the political order.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Legalism\">Legalism</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Chinese_law&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Legalism\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>In contrast to Confucius\u2019 <i>li</i>-based theory, the Legalism advocates the utilization of codified laws and harsh punishment to achieve social order. This is due to the legalists\u2019 belief that all human beings are born evil and self-interested. Therefore, if left unrestrained, people would engage in selfish behavior which will undoubtedly lead to social unrest. To cure this defect and force people to behave morally, the only way, believed the legalists, is to publicly promulgate clearly written laws and impose harsh punishments.\n</p><p>Realizing that the abilities of rulers are often limited and that reliance on the ruler\u2019s ability and judgment often leads to adverse results, the legalists designed a system in which the law is run by the state, not the ruler. This ensures that the laws will be applied impartially without the interference of personal bias of the ruler or ones who are responsible for applying the laws. It also makes it irrelevant whether the ruler has superior abilities. This non-action promoted by the legalists is their understanding of the concept of <i>wuwei</i>, which is different from the Confucians\u2019 understanding of the same concept.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Comparison\">Comparison</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Chinese_law&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Comparison\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>Notwithstanding such an understanding, the ruler, like in Confucianism, has the ultimate authority to decide what the law should be. Therefore, like Confucianism, Legalism is subject to abuse as well. In fact, the Qin emperor implemented strict laws and extremely harsh punishments without taking into account mitigating circumstances even for insignificant crimes. For example, books were burned and people holding different ideals were buried alive. While the Qin emperor successfully instilled fear and respect for law into the minds of his people, the harshness of the law led to his quick demise after only 14 years of reigning over China.\n</p><p>In summary, although both Confucianism and Legalism were developed in a period of turmoil and both were aimed at the re-unification of the country, the two theories went opposite directions with one advocating for and one against the use of formal laws to achieve social order. What the two theories have in common is their concession of the ultimate authority to the ruler, who remained above and beyond the li or law. It is true that neither theory is ideal in achieving a social order. Nevertheless, both theories have had a significant impact on the cultural and legal development in China, and their influence remains visible today.\n</p><p>The significant influence of the Legalist tradition in Chinese law has historically been overlooked. Although the Confucian ideology provided the fundamentals for the substance of traditional law, the Legalist school constructed the important framework of the traditional legal system. The <a href=\"/wiki/Han_dynasty\" title=\"Han dynasty\">Han dynasty</a> retained the basic legal system established under the Qin but modified some of the harsher aspects in line with the Confucian philosophy of social control.\n</p><p>The Han dynasty formally recognized four sources of law: <i>l\u00fc</i> (\u5f8b: \"codified laws\"), <i>ling</i> (\u4ee4: \"the emperor's order\"), <i>ke</i> (\u79d1: \"statutes inherited from previous dynasties\") and <i>bi</i> (\u6bd4: \"precedents\"), among which <i>ling</i> has the highest binding power over the other three. Most legal professionals were not lawyers but generalists trained in philosophy and literature. The local, classically trained, Confucian gentry played a crucial role as arbiters and handled all but the most serious local disputes.\n</p><p>Eventually, the incorporation of the essentials of Confucianist <i>li</i> into legal codes occurred with this Confucian conception dominating ancient Chinese law. Ch'\u00fc concludes that the gradual process of Confucianisation of law was the most significant development in the legal system of China prior to 20th century modernization.<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> The line between ruling by moral influence and ruling by punishment was not always clearly delineated. For example, <i>li</i> could be enforced by moral influence and legal means. The metamorphosis of <i>li</i> into law depended on its widespread and unvaried acceptance by society.\n</p><p>Although the <a href=\"/wiki/Codification_(law)\" title=\"Codification (law)\">codification</a> of law was largely completed by the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Tang_Code\" title=\"Tang Code\">Tang Code</a></i> of CE 624, throughout the centuries the Confucian foundations of the Tang Code were retained, and indeed with some aspects of it strengthened by the later dynasties. <i>The Great Ming Code</i>, which was a model for the Qing code, covered every part of social and political life, especially family and ritual, but also foreign relations and even relations of earthly life with the cosmos. <sup id=\"cite_ref-FOOTNOTEJiang2005Introduction_9-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-FOOTNOTEJiang2005Introduction-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The Confucian notion that morality and self-discipline was more important than legal codes caused many historians, such as <a href=\"/wiki/Max_Weber\" title=\"Max Weber\">Max Weber</a>, until the mid-20th century to conclude that law was not an important part of Imperial Chinese society. This notion, however, has come under extreme criticism and is no longer the conventional wisdom among Sinologists, who have concluded that Imperial China had an elaborate system of both criminal and civil law which was comparable to anything found in Europe.\n</p><p>During the Qing dynasty, criminal justice was based on extremely detailed <i><a href=\"/wiki/Great_Qing_Legal_Code\" title=\"Great Qing Legal Code\">Great Qing Legal Code</a></i>. One element of the traditional Chinese criminal justice system is the notion that criminal law has a moral purpose, one of which is to get the convicted to repent and see the error of his ways. In the traditional Chinese legal system, a person could not be convicted of a crime unless he has confessed. This often led to the use of <a href=\"/wiki/Torture\" title=\"Torture\">torture</a>, in order to extract the necessary confession. These elements still influence modern Chinese views toward law. All <a href=\"/wiki/Capital_punishment\" title=\"Capital punishment\">capital offenses</a> were reported to the capital and required the personal approval of the <a href=\"/wiki/List_of_Emperors_of_the_Qing_Dynasty\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"List of Emperors of the Qing Dynasty\">emperor</a>.\n</p><p>There was no <a href=\"/wiki/Civil_code\" title=\"Civil code\">civil code</a> separate from the <a href=\"/wiki/Criminal_code\" title=\"Criminal code\">criminal code</a>, which led to the now discredited belief that traditional Chinese law had no civil law. More recent studies have demonstrated that most of the magistrates' legal work was in civil disputes, and that there was an elaborate system of <a href=\"/wiki/Private_law\" title=\"Private law\">civil law</a> which used the criminal code to establish <a href=\"/wiki/Torts\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Torts\">torts</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Modernization\">Modernization</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Chinese_law&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Modernization\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The introduction and translation of Western legal texts into Chinese is believed to have been started under the auspices of <a href=\"/wiki/Lin_Zexu\" title=\"Lin Zexu\">Lin Zexu</a> in 1839. More systematic introduction of Western law together with other Western sciences started with the establishment of <a href=\"/wiki/Tongwen_Guan\" title=\"Tongwen Guan\">Tongwen Guan</a> in 1862. The major efforts in translation of Western law that continued until the 1920s prepared the building blocks for modern Chinese legal language and Chinese law.<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> Legal translation was very important from 1896 to 1936 during which period the Chinese absorbed and codified their version of Western laws. These efforts were assisted by the medium of the Japanese legal language and law developed in Japan during the <a href=\"/wiki/Meiji_period\" title=\"Meiji period\">Meiji period</a> which involved in large part Japanese translation of <a href=\"/wiki/Civil_law_(legal_system)\" title=\"Civil law (legal system)\">European Continental laws</a>.\n</p><p>In the late <a href=\"/wiki/Qing_dynasty\" title=\"Qing dynasty\">Qing dynasty</a> there was a concerted effort to establish legal codes based on European models. Because of the German victory in the <a href=\"/wiki/Franco-Prussian_War\" title=\"Franco-Prussian War\">Franco-Prussian War</a> and because Japan was used as the model for political and legal reform, the law codes which were adopted were modeled closely after that of Germany.\n</p><p>Attitudes toward the traditional Chinese legal system changed markedly in the late-20th century. Most Chinese and Westerners of the early 20th century regarded the traditional Chinese legal system as backward and barbaric. However, extensive research into China's traditional legal system has caused attitudes to become more favorable in the late-20th and early 21st centuries. Researchers of the early and mid-20th century tended to compare the traditional Chinese legal system to then contemporary systems, finding the former to be backward. However, more recent research compared the 18th-century Chinese legal system to European systems of the 18th century, resulting in a far more positive view of traditional Chinese law.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources.

One theory is the \"thin\", or formal, theory of rule of law, and the other is the \"thick\" theory.\n</p><p>The \"thin\" theory of rule of law is described by Randall Peerenboom as at the basest level incorporating a legal system that imposes meaningful restraints on the state and individuals in ruling power, that the law is supreme, and that all citizens are equal before the law (Peerenboom, 2). According to Lon Fuller\u2019s account of thin theory, rule of law exists in a society when the laws of that society are \u201cgeneral, public, prospective, clear, consistent, capable of being followed, stable, and enforced\u201d (Peerenboom, 3). The thin theory has also been explained by Joseph Raz as emphasizing the formal or instrumental aspects of a legal system regardless of whether it is part of a particular political structure, i.e. a democratic or non-democratic society.[14] Thick theory rule of law espouses all the elements of thin theory in addition imposes a political, social, and economic concept into the rule of law. The <a href=\"/wiki/Rule_of_law\" title=\"Rule of law\">rule of law</a> is regarded by some as presupposing political or economic structures of <a href=\"/wiki/Liberal_democracy\" title=\"Liberal democracy\">liberal democracy</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Human_rights\" title=\"Human rights\">human rights</a> and other ideal socio-legal order.[11] Some scholars believe that given China's socialist and non-democratic political system and practice, it is at best regarded as a country of rule by law with law used by the state as an instrument for social control.[12] However, others rely on the formal or thin theory of rule of law to interpret fazhi as a legal reality in China.[13] Additionally, some believe that China may still fall short of the thin theory of rule of law.\n</p><p>Of particular relevance to the second principle set out above, was the enactment of the Administrative Permission Law of the PRC (APL) on 27 August 2003, effective from July 2004. The APL for the first time requires all laws and regulations that subject any civil act to approval requirements to be published.<sup id=\"cite_ref-China_Briefing_Business_Guide:_North_East_China_21-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-China_Briefing_Business_Guide:_North_East_China-21\">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The APL also provides that only those laws adopted by the National People\u2019s Congress or its Standing Committee, administrative regulations promulgated by the State Council, and local regulations adopted by the local people\u2019s congresses may impose administrative approval requirements. Individual ministries or agencies (central or local) do not have such powers except in specified circumstances. This is consistent with the hierarchy of laws and regulations provided under the Legislative Law of the PRC. The enactment of the APL represents an encouraging step forward.<sup id=\"cite_ref-China_Briefing_Business_Guide:_North_East_China_21-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-China_Briefing_Business_Guide:_North_East_China-21\">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Despite the newly elevated role of courts in Chinese society, there still remains some consensus about defects in China\u2019s legal system in regards to progressing towards the rule of law. Scholars point to the following defects as slowing movement toward rule of law. These include:\n</p>\n<ul><li>First, the <a href=\"/wiki/National_People%E2%80%99s_Congress\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"National People\u2019s Congress\">National People\u2019s Congress</a> is ineffective at executing its constitutional duty to legislate and supervise the government.<sup id=\"cite_ref-22\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-22\">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup></li>\n<li>Second, the <a href=\"/wiki/Constitution_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China\" title=\"Constitution of the People&#39;s Republic of China\">Chinese Constitution</a> is not treated as the supreme law, nor is it enforced.<sup id=\"cite_ref-23\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-23\">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup></li>\n<li>Third, the judiciary is not independent from political pressure. On the other hand, direct intervention in particular cases by the CCP has lessened in recent years, as has the direct influence of the CCP on the legislative process.<sup id=\"cite_ref-24\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-24\">&#91;24&#93;</a></sup></li>\n<li>Fourth, there is a high level of corruption among public officials. Personal favors, bribery, and taking of public monies are all too common at all levels of government.<sup id=\"cite_ref-25\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-25\">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup></li>\n<li>Finally, the legal profession is inadequate for lack of qualified attorneys and judges.<sup id=\"cite_ref-26\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-26\">&#91;26&#93;</a></sup> This failure is being remedied by legislation aimed at instituting higher educational standards for judges, opening more courts and law schools throughout China.<sup id=\"cite_ref-27\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-27\">&#91;27&#93;</a></sup></li></ul>\n<p>In the 2000s, the <a href=\"/wiki/Weiquan_movement\" title=\"Weiquan movement\">Weiquan movement</a> began in the PRC, seeking to advance citizens' rights partly by petitioning for enforcement of existing laws, and partly through activism. Lawyers in the movement have seen some court victories, but in other cases they are unsuccessful.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Chinese_law&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Citations\">Citations</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Chinese_law&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12\" title=\"Edit section: Citations\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap mw-references-columns\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><cite class=\"citation book\">Miller, Frederic P.; Vandome, Agnes F.; McBrewster, John (November 2009). <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/Chinese_Law.html?id=mouSQgAACAAJ\"><i>Chinese Law</i></a>.
