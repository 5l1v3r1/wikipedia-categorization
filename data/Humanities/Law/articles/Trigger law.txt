A trigger law is a nickname for a law that is unenforceable, but may achieve enforceability if a key change in circumstances occurs. In the United States, four U.S. states—Mississippi, Louisiana, North Dakota, and South Dakota—have trigger laws that would automatically ban abortion if the landmark case Roe v. Wade is overturned.   Illinois formerly had a trigger law (enacted in 1975), but repealed it in 2017.   An additional ten states retain their abortion bans enacted before 1973; these statutes are not enforceable due to Roe, but could possibly be enforceable should Roe be overturned.
