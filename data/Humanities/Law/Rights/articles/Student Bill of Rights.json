It outlines a population's basic beliefs regarding student rights. These statements of belief are often the foundation for future legislative efforts or collaborative efforts to create joint statements between organizations. The <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=European_Student_Union&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"European Student Union (page does not exist)\">European Student Union</a>, for example, uses their Student Rights Charter when lobbying for student rights in the European Union Higher Education Area as a document representing the student will.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> The historic <a href=\"/wiki/National_Student_Association\" title=\"National Student Association\">National Student Association</a> in the United States used their Student Bill of Rights to help create dialogue between the <a href=\"/wiki/American_Association_of_University_Professors\" title=\"American Association of University Professors\">American Association of University Professors</a> and to initiate the creation of a joint statement on student rights.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> This collaborative effort gave credence to the demands of students and helped normalize student rights on campuses across North America. While the <a href=\"/wiki/United_States_Student_Association\" title=\"United States Student Association\">United States Student Association</a> does not have a student bill of rights of its own, it upholds the 1947 student bill of rights put forth by the National Student Association.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>These documents tend to do several things. They can be statements of belief, policy or law. When put forth by a student organization or third party organization they tend to be statements of belief because these organizations do not often have the ability to enforce their beliefs. Even though they are not legally binding they are important because they help policy and lawmakers understand what students expect and believe to be ethical treatment. At the institutional level they tend to be policy statements. These are legally binding as a promise from the institution to the students who attend and have been found in court to be considered to be part of the educational contract.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>At any level these documents provide students with an understanding of their civil or legal rights which are already contained in legislation. These include rights pertinent to all citizens and also to students in the educational setting and provide procedural rights to inform students how institutions should be respecting their legal rights. When used as a statement of belief, however, they often include rights an organization feels students should have and the procedural rights institutions must follow to ensure these rights are fulfilled. There are currently a number of student petitions calling for the creation of national student bills in various countries. While there have been some attempts to create subject specific student bills in the United States, like the Academic Bill of Rights, these have not been successful due primarily for demand for a document which is wider in scope and deals with students constitutional, civil, contractual and consumer rights.\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#North_American_Student_Bills\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">North American Student Bills</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#United_States_of_America\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">United States of America</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-3 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#American_National_Student_Bills\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.1.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">American National Student Bills</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-3 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#National_Student_Association_(NSA)\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.1.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">National Student Association (NSA)</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-3 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#United_States_Student_Association\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.1.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">United States Student Association</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-3 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#2003_Academic_Bill_of_Rights_--Failed\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.1.4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">2003 Academic Bill of Rights --Failed</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#American_Institutional_Student_Bills\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">American Institutional Student Bills</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#Canada\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Canada</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-3 tocsection-9\"><a href=\"#Canadian_Federation_of_Students\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.3.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Canadian Federation of Students</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-3 tocsection-10\"><a href=\"#Declaration_on_the_Canadian_Student\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.3.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Declaration on the Canadian Student</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-11\"><a href=\"#European_Student_Bills\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">European Student Bills</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-12\"><a href=\"#European_Student_Union\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">European Student Union</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-13\"><a href=\"#European_National_Country_Level_Student_Bills\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">European National Country Level Student Bills</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-3 tocsection-14\"><a href=\"#Germany\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.2.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Germany</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-3 tocsection-15\"><a href=\"#Romania\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.2.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Romania</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-3 tocsection-16\"><a href=\"#United_Kingdom\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.2.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">United Kingdom</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-17\"><a href=\"#European_Institutional_Student_Bills\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">European Institutional Student Bills</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-3 tocsection-18\"><a href=\"#Oxford_University\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.3.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Oxford University</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-19\"><a href=\"#Asian_Student_Bills\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Asian Student Bills</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-20\"><a href=\"#African_Student_Bills\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">African Student Bills</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-21\"><a href=\"#South_&amp;_Central_American_Student_Bills\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">South &amp;

The text of this document is not easily accessible.  In 1967, however, the NSA put forth a joint statement on the rights and freedoms of students with the American Association of University Professors AAUP (now the Association of American Colleges and Universities).

This bill, which was rejected in congress, was not an all encompassing student bill of rights but was narrowly defined to address academic freedom. Nevertheless, it was the first attempt at the creation of national legislation. The congressman found that \"at almost every American university, conservative professors are drastically outnumbered.\" This bill was intended to secure the intellectual freedom of students and faculty. It did not address whether teachers would have the freedom to determine all course goals, curriculum, assignments, grading schemes and course timeline. These issues are of major importance because students in Europe are calling for rights which protect students from teachers having complete academic freedom in the classroom and which regulate them to ensure students have minimum educational quality standards.<sup id=\"cite_ref-navigatehighered.weebly_8-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-navigatehighered.weebly-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"American_Institutional_Student_Bills\">American Institutional Student Bills</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Student_Bill_of_Rights&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: American Institutional Student Bills\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In the United States individual institutions often have their own Student Bill of Rights, Charter of Rights and Freedoms or Code of Rights and Responsibilities. In elementary and secondary education these codes are often drafted by school board officials with perhaps the input of parent or parent teacher associations. In post secondary institutions these are often drafted by the academic senate with the contribution of student representatives. This process often includes varying degrees of student input from student surveys to no student voice and the academic senate may have as much as 50% student representation or as little as 0% student representation depending on the structure of the institution.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Canada\">Canada</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Student_Bill_of_Rights&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Canada\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Canadian_Federation_of_Students\">Canadian Federation of Students</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Student_Bill_of_Rights&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: Canadian Federation of Students\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Canadian_Federation_of_Students\" title=\"Canadian Federation of Students\">Canadian Federation of Students</a> has yet to accept a student bill or rights, code of rights and responsibilities or a charter of rights and freedoms.
