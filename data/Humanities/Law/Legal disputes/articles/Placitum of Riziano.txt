The Placitum of Riziano (Italian: Placito del Risano) was a dispute that took place c. 804 around the river Riziano, probably at Ri≈æana in modern Slovenia. Legates sent by Charlemagne heard complaints by the leaders of Istria about the bishops and the duke of Istria, John. It is an important document for Istrian history. The document is believed to have been recorded on the orders of Fortunatus II, patriarch of Grado.  A point of historiographical contention is the fact that only the leaders of the coastal towns of Istria were present; one explanation for this is that the issues being discussed (for example, the abolition of the right of the townspeople to fish) only affected the coast.  The Latin text has been edited many times, but the standard edition is by Manaresi  . The text has been translated into various modern languages.
