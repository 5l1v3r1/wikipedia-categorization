Recipients were selected by a distinguished panel of international legal experts from nominations received from around the world.  The Gruber Foundation Justice Prize was presented to individuals or organizations for contributions that have advanced the cause of justice as delivered through the legal system. The award was intended to acknowledge individual efforts, as well as to encourage further advancements in the field and progress toward bringing about a fundamentally just world.
