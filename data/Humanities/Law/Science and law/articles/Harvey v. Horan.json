Horan</b></i>, 278 F. 3d 370 (4th Cir. 2002) is a federal court case dealing with <a href=\"/wiki/Felony\" title=\"Felony\">felons</a>' rights of access to <a href=\"/wiki/Genetic_fingerprinting\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Genetic fingerprinting\">DNA testing</a>.  The <a href=\"/wiki/U.S._District_Court_for_the_Eastern_District_of_Virginia\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia\">Eastern Virginia District Court</a> originally found that felons were entitled access to DNA testing on potentially <a href=\"/wiki/Exculpatory_evidence\" title=\"Exculpatory evidence\">exculpatory evidence</a>, but this finding was later overturned by the <a href=\"/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Fourth_Circuit\" title=\"United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\">Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals</a>.  Nevertheless, the case paved the way for the <a href=\"/wiki/Innocence_Protection_Act\" title=\"Innocence Protection Act\">Innocence Protection Act</a>, which ensures that convicted offenders can try to prove their innocence by requesting DNA testing on evidence in government's possession that was used in their case.\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#The_case\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">The case</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#The_appeal\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">The appeal</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Fallout\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Fallout</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Resources\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Resources</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_case\">The case</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Harvey_v._Horan&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: The case\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>On April 30, 1990, James Harvey was convicted of <a href=\"/wiki/Rape\" title=\"Rape\">rape</a> and forcible <a href=\"/wiki/Sodomy\" title=\"Sodomy\">sodomy</a> by a <a href=\"/wiki/Jury\" title=\"Jury\">jury</a> in <a href=\"/wiki/Fairfax_County,_Virginia\" title=\"Fairfax County, Virginia\">Fairfax County</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Circuit_Court\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Circuit Court\">Circuit Court</a>.  He was sentenced to 25 years in <a href=\"/wiki/Prison\" title=\"Prison\">prison</a>.  One piece of evidence used to convict Harvey was <a href=\"/wiki/Restriction_fragment_length_polymorphism\" title=\"Restriction fragment length polymorphism\">restriction fragment length polymorphism</a> (\"RFLP\") <a href=\"/wiki/DNA_testing\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"DNA testing\">DNA testing</a>.  The victim had two assailants, and this test prevented both Harvey and his co-defendant from being excluded as a possible source of <a href=\"/wiki/Spermatozoa\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Spermatozoa\">spermatozoa</a> recovered from the victim through conventional <a href=\"/wiki/Serology\" title=\"Serology\">serology</a>.  Harvey was also implicated by testimony from his co-defendant, the victim, and a third prosecution witness.  However, this testimony indicated that Harvey had not <a href=\"/wiki/Ejaculation\" title=\"Ejaculation\">ejaculated</a> during the attack.\n</p><p>Harvey did not appeal his conviction but did file a state petition for a <a href=\"/wiki/Writ\" title=\"Writ\">writ</a> of <a href=\"/wiki/Habeas_corpus\" title=\"Habeas corpus\">habeas corpus</a>.  His petition was rejected by the <a href=\"/wiki/Virginia_Supreme_Court\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Virginia Supreme Court\">Virginia Supreme Court</a> in 1993.  On February 25, 1994, Harvey filed action in federal <a href=\"/wiki/United_States_district_court\" title=\"United States district court\">district court</a> against the <a href=\"/wiki/Governor_of_Virginia\" title=\"Governor of Virginia\">Governor of Virginia</a> under <a href=\"/wiki/42_U.S.C._%C2%A7_1983\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983</a>, a post-<a href=\"/wiki/American_Civil_War\" title=\"American Civil War\">Civil War</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Civil_rights\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Civil rights\">civil rights</a> statute that allows citizens to sue state and local officials in federal courts for <a href=\"/wiki/United_States_Constitution\" title=\"United States Constitution\">constitutional</a> violations.  He claimed that the state's failure to re-test biological evidence from the case was a violation of his rights under the <a href=\"/wiki/Due_process\" title=\"Due process\">due process</a> clause.  On July 25, 1995, the district court dismissed Harvey's petition, finding that he had not exhausted state remedies and would have to refile his claim for DNA testing as a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under <a href=\"/wiki/Title_28_of_the_United_States_Code\" title=\"Title 28 of the United States Code\">28 U.S.C.</a>&#160;<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2254\">\u00a7&#160;2254</a>.\n</p><p>In 1996, the <a href=\"/wiki/New_York_City\" title=\"New York City\">New York</a>-based <a href=\"/wiki/Innocence_Project\" title=\"Innocence Project\">Innocence Project</a> contacted the <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Virginia_Division_of_Forensic_Science&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Virginia Division of Forensic Science (page does not exist)\">Virginia Division of Forensic Science</a> on Harvey's behalf, requesting the biological evidence form the case.  The Innocence Project wanted to re-test the evidence using <a href=\"/wiki/Short_tandem_repeat\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Short tandem repeat\">short tandem repeat</a> (\"STR\") DNA testing, which was unavailable at the time of Harvey's trial. The Division of Forensic Science recommended that the Innocence Project bring its request to the Fairfax County Commonwealth's Attorney's office.  The Innocence Project made this request in February 1998 and July 1999.  In October 1999, Commonwealth attorney <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Robert_F._Horan_Jr.&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Robert F. Horan Jr. (page does not exist)\">Robert F. Horan Jr.</a> denied the request for access to the evidence, asserting that even if Harvey were excluded as a contributor of genetic material, it would not prove his innocence due to the testimony indicating that he had not left any biological evidence behind.\n</p><p>Harvey then filed action in <a href=\"/wiki/U.S._District_Court_for_the_Eastern_District_of_Virginia\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia\">district court</a> under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.  Harvey's attorneys cited this statute, which is most often used in cases of police brutality, because Harvey's previous lawyers had missed a filing deadline in the more common criminal appeals process.  They argued that Harvey's right to due process was infringed because he was denied access to potentially exculpatory evidence.  They said that the test could be decisive if it yielded certain result &#8212; for example, if the laboratory identified DNA from two men and neither of them was Harvey.  They also noted that although the prosecutor claimed that his office would allow DNA testing in appropriate cases, Fairfax had never found an appropriate case. \n</p><p>On April 16, 2001 in <a href=\"/wiki/Alexandria,_Virginia\" title=\"Alexandria, Virginia\">Alexandria</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Virginia\" title=\"Virginia\">Virginia</a>, U.S. District Judge <a href=\"/wiki/Albert_V._Bryan_Jr.\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Albert V. Bryan Jr.\">Albert V. Bryan Jr.</a> ruled that Horan had violated Harvey's right to due process under the <a href=\"/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution\" title=\"Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution\">14th</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution\" title=\"Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution\">5th Amendment</a> by refusing the test.  In a 13-page opinion, Bryan stated, \"due process is not a technical conception with a fixed concept unrelated to time, place and circumstances. It is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands.\"  He found that Harvey had a due process right of access to the DNA evidence under <i><a href=\"/wiki/Brady_v._Maryland\" title=\"Brady v. Maryland\">Brady v. Maryland</a></i> (1963) because the material could prove to be exculpatory evidence, asserting that \"denying the plaintiff access to potentially powerful exculpatory evidence would result in . . . a miscarriage of justice.\"  Significantly, Bryan also concluded that Harvey\u2019s claim was not in effect a petition for a writ of habeas corpus because Harvey was not seeking immediate release from prison or challenging his conviction.  The judge ordered Horan to send all the evidence to the <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Virginia_State_Laboratory&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Virginia State Laboratory (page does not exist)\">Virginia State Laboratory</a> for testing.  Although Bryant's decision was not binding in other courts, it was significant because Bryant was the first judge to issue such an order.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_appeal\">The appeal</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Harvey_v._Horan&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: The appeal\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>On September 26, 2001, Horan's lawyer, <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Jack_L._Gould&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Jack L. Gould (page does not exist)\">Jack L. Gould</a>, appealed the decision to the <a href=\"/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Fourth_Circuit\" title=\"United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\">United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a>.  He contended that \u00a7 1983 was not an appropriate vehicle for Harvey\u2019s action.  He stated that the procedural flaws in the claim required that it be dismissed because it was really a successive petition for a writ of habeas corpus and an attempt to get around strict rules and deadlines.\n</p><p>On January 23, 2002, the court concluded that Harvey's rights had not been violated and that the lower court had erred in its decision.  Fourth Circuit <a href=\"/wiki/Chief_Judge\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Chief Judge\">Chief Judge</a> <a href=\"/wiki/J._Harvie_Wilkinson_III\" title=\"J. Harvie Wilkinson III\">J. Harvie Wilkinson III</a> wrote the opinion, in which Judge Niemeyer joined. Judge King wrote a concurring opinion.\n</p><p>The majority opinion stated that the claim was, in effect, a petition for a writ of habeas corpus brought without leave of court.  According to a previous case, <i><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Heck_v._Humphrey&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Heck v. Humphrey (page does not exist)\">Heck v. Humphrey</a></i> (1994), a convicted criminal defendant cannot bring a \u00a7 1983 action that would \"necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence\" unless the defendant can prove that his \"conviction or sentence has already been invalidated.\"  In this decision, the <a href=\"/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States\" title=\"Supreme Court of the United States\">Supreme Court</a> found that <a href=\"/wiki/Civil_law_(common_law)\" title=\"Civil law (common law)\">civil</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Tort\" title=\"Tort\">tort</a> actions are \"not appropriate vehicles for challenging the validity of outstanding criminal judgments.\"  As such, the majority opinion in the appeal overturned the lower court's ruling because it found that Harvey had substantively failed to make a claim under \u00a7 1983.  Judge Wilkinson wrote that Harvey had attempted to circumvent habeas corpus requirements, which required exhaustion of remedies at the state level before moving to the federal level.  By bringing his claim directly to federal court under \u00a7 1983, Harvey had violated procedure:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>While we agree with Harvey that the question of guilt or innocence lies at the heart of the criminal justice system, we also believe that the proper process for raising violations of constitutional rights in criminal proceedings cannot be abandoned. Because the substance of a claim cannot be severed from the proper manner of presenting it, we find Harvey\u2019s \u00a7 1983 action to be deficient.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The opinion went on to state that Harvey's action under \u00a7 1983 \"sought to invalidate a final state conviction whose lawfulness has in no way been impugned\".  Harvey claimed that he was challenging neither the fact nor the duration of his confinement, pointing out that he merely seeks evidence which could also prove his guilt.  The court found this argument to be an evasion, saying, \"He is trying to use a \u00a7 1983 action as a discovery device to overturn his state conviction\".  The majority opinion asserted that the finality of convictions could not be challenged by advances in technology:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>The possibility of post-conviction developments, whether in law or science, is simply too great to justify judicially sanctioned constitutional attacks upon final criminal judgments. \u2026Establishing a constitutional due process right under \u00a7 1983 to retest evidence with each forward step in forensic science would leave perfectly valid judgments in a perpetually unsettled state.</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to the majority opinion, the only purpose of Harvey's claim was to challenge his conviction based on evidence that was available to him at the time of his trial.  As such, the court concluded that Harvey's rights had not been violated by Horan.  The court also stated that Harvey could only make his claim in habeas corpus, but that even if he had the court would be forced to dismiss it, for he had already filed such a petition in federal court.\n</p><p>Circuit Judge King concurred in part and in judgment with the majority decision.  While he agreed that the lower court's decision was incorrect, he also contended that Harvey's claim could properly be brought under \u00a7 1983.  The judge stated that the act of providing Harvey access to evidence did not alone necessarily imply the invalidity of Harvey's conviction.  King agrees with Harvey's attorney, <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Peter_J._Neufeld&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Peter J. Neufeld (page does not exist)\">Peter J. Neufeld</a>, that the evidence could indeed inculpate Harvey and thus that \u00a7 1983 was a proper vehicle for bringing the action.  However, King determined that since the material had been available to him at trial and since he had not been denied access to the legal system or evidence known to be exculpatory, Harvey did not have a legal claim to discover evidence under <i>Brady v. Maryland</i>. He stated that Harvey's claim was invalid not because he violated procedure, but because he could not prove that a state actor deprived him of a federally protected right.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Fallout\">Fallout</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Harvey_v._Horan&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Fallout\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>After the January 2002 decision was handed down, Harvey applied to Virginia's Fairfax Circuit Court for DNA testing based on a 2001 law allowing felons increased access to potentially exculpatory biological evidence that had not previously been subjected to the current DNA testing method.  On March 1, 2002, the court ordered the <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Division_of_Forensic_Science&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Division of Forensic Science (page does not exist)\">Division of Forensic Science</a> to conduct the testing.  On May 15, 2002, after the testing was completed, the division filed a <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Certificate_of_analysis&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Certificate of analysis (page does not exist)\">certificate of analysis</a> stating that Harvey could not be eliminated as a possible contributor to the sperm fractions found on the victim. On September 24, 2002, Harvey filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the Virginia Supreme Court, challenging the validity of the certificate of analysis and related test results.  The court dismissed the petition on June 10, 2004, saying that it did not have jurisdiction to consider it.\n</p><p>Back in March 2002, the federal appeal had come before the full Fourth Circuit as an <a href=\"/wiki/En_banc\" title=\"En banc\">en banc</a> reconsideration (as opposed to the original three-judge panel).  By this time, the issue was <a href=\"/wiki/Mootness\" title=\"Mootness\">moot</a>, but two judges, <a href=\"/wiki/J._Michael_Luttig\" title=\"J. Michael Luttig\">J. Michael Luttig</a> and Wilkinson, wrote anyway.  Luttig wrote that the \"right of access to evidence for tests which ... could prove beyond any doubt that the individual in fact did not commit the crime, is constitutionally required ... as a matter of basic fairness.\" Luttig also concluded that there is \"a limited, constitutional, post-conviction right of access to previously produced forensic evidence for the purpose of [DNA] testing.\"  Wilkinson responded by expressing hope that inmates like Harvey would have access to DNA testing but that it was a matter for the legislature to decide.  Significantly, his majority opinion in the original appeal stated, \"our decision reflects the core democratic ideal that if this entitlement is to be conferred, it should be accomplished by legislative action rather than by a federal court as a matter of constitutional right.\"\n</p><p>Wilkinson's hopes were manifested with the passage of the <a href=\"/wiki/Bipartisan\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Bipartisan\">bipartisan</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Innocence_Protection_Act\" title=\"Innocence Protection Act\">Innocence Protection Act</a> in 2004.  On February 10, 2000, Senator <a href=\"/wiki/Patrick_Leahy\" title=\"Patrick Leahy\">Patrick Leahy</a> (D-VT) introduced the act after devoting nearly a year to evaluating flaws in the administration of the death penalty nationwide.  A few months later, the bill is introduced in the House by <a href=\"/wiki/Bill_Delahunt\" title=\"Bill Delahunt\">Bill Delahunt</a> (D-MA) and <a href=\"/wiki/Ray_LaHood\" title=\"Ray LaHood\">Ray LaHood</a> (R-IL).  Innocence Project co-founders Neufeld and <a href=\"/wiki/Barry_C._Scheck\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Barry C. Scheck\">Barry C. Scheck</a> testified several times over the next few years as witnesses before hearings of <a href=\"/wiki/U.S._Congressional_committees\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"U.S. Congressional committees\">committee</a> on the Act.  Both mentioned the <i>Harvey v. Horan</i> case in their testimony, saying that it was significant for being the first federal court decision in the country to recognize a constitutional right of access to post-conviction DNA testing.  The Innocence Protection Act eventually passed in the <a href=\"/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives\" title=\"United States House of Representatives\">House of Representatives</a> by an overwhelming majority (393-14) on November 5, 2003.  On October 9, 2004, the legislation, which was sponsored by Senator <a href=\"/wiki/Patrick_Leahy\" title=\"Patrick Leahy\">Patrick Leahy</a>, passed unanimously in the <a href=\"/wiki/United_States_Senate\" title=\"United States Senate\">United States Senate</a> after narrowly moving through the <a href=\"/wiki/U.S._Senate_Committee_on_the_Judiciary\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary\">Senate Judiciary Committee</a>.\n</p><p>In 2009, the <a href=\"/wiki/United_States_Supreme_Court\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"United States Supreme Court\">United States Supreme Court</a> addressed the issue of a <a href=\"/wiki/Due_process_clause\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Due process clause\">due process</a> right to DNA testing in <i><a href=\"/wiki/District_Attorney%27s_Office_v._Osborne\" title=\"District Attorney&#39;s Office v. Osborne\">District Attorney's Office v. Osborne</a></i>. The court decided that prisoners did not have a right to the testing. The decision only affects those few states that do not have laws similar to the federal Innocence Protection Act that explicitly give prisoners a right to DNA evidence.<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/19/us/19scotus.html?_r=1&amp;hp\">[1]</a>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Resources\">Resources</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Harvey_v._Horan&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Resources\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A25317-2001Apr16\">U.S. Judge Says Felons Entitled to DNA Tests</a> - <i>The Washington Post</i></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.truthinjustice.org/vadna.htm\">VA Judge: Inmates have right to DNA tests</a> - <i>The Associated Press</i></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.denverda.org/legalResource/harvey.pdf\">Appeal from the United States District Court</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.courts.state.va.us/opinions/opnscvwp/1022291.pdf\">Virginia Supreme Court decision</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.law-forensic.com/crime_and_punishment.htm\">Post-conviction ethics</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.justicedenied.org/volume2issue8.htm\">Conservative US Circuit Court Judges Back Post-Conviction DNA Testing</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://justice.policy.net/cjreform/ipa/\">The Innocence Protection Act in the 108th Congress</a></li></ul>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw2227\nCached time: 20180918053543\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.132 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.172 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 1513/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 8806/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 1764/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 12/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\nLua time usage: 0.038/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 1.39 MB/50 MB\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%  132.548      1 -total\n 96.30%  127.640      1 Template:Infobox_COA_case\n 89.35%  118.428      1 Template:Infobox_court_case\n 72.58%   96.203      1 Template:Infobox\n 19.53%   25.888      3 Template:Ifempty\n  5.45%    7.227      1 Template:PAGENAMEBASE\n  4.82%    6.393      1 Template:Infobox_court_case/images\n  3.61%    4.785      1 Template:UnitedStatesCode\n  2.37%    3.141      1 Template:Main_other\n  1.47%    1.948      3 Template:Trim\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:489150-0!canonical and timestamp 20180918053543 and revision id 798382660\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","*":"Science_and_law"},{"sortkey":"","*":"United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Fourth_Circuit_cases"},{"sortkey":"","*":"2002_in_United_States_case_law"},{"sortkey":"","*":"United_States_criminal_procedure_case_law"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Albert V.
