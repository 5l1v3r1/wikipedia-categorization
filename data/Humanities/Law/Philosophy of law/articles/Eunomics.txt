Eunomics is a term, first proposed by legal scholar Lon Fuller in 1954 , to describe "the science, theory or study of good order and workable arrangements".  Stemming from Behavioral Systems Theory, it was an attempt to fuse what Fuller saw as the inherent morality of law with the empirical data and methods of the objective sciences. Its main practical application appears to be as a form of industrial dispute resolution.  Nobel prize winner Oliver E. Williamson, a leading mind of the New Institutional Economics (NIE) movement, refers to Fuller's definition of eunomics as a simulacrum of his understanding of the term governance. Same as with the NIE, eunomics are foremost concerned with the question how to achieve a desired outcome.
