Founderism (being a Founderist)  is an intellectual outlook that has a strong "Reverence for the founders"  of a state. The term is viewed as a pejorative epithet,  accusing those so labeled as having a worldview that sacrifices historic accuracy for turning the "Founding into a fetish".  The antonym "anti-founderism" is applied to those who "seem convinced that there was something profoundly wrong with the origins" of the state.
