The Feminism and Legal Theory Project is a project aimed at addressing issues relating to women and law. It was founded in 1984 by legal theorist Martha Fineman, a pioneer in feminist legal theory. The project nurtures scholars from around the world, bringing them together to study and debate a wide range of topics related to feminist theory and law. The project began at the University of Wisconsin Law School to provide a forum for interdisciplinary feminist scholarship addressing important issues in law and society. In 1990, the project moved to Columbia Law School, and in 1999, to Cornell Law School. Since 2004, the project has been part of Emory University School of Law, where Fineman holds a Robert W. Woodruff Professorship. The project has resulted in the publication of several books on feminist legal theory. Fineman has been its director since 1984.  One of the hallmarks of the Feminism and Legal Theory Project is its quarterly, interdisciplinary workshops. Scholars from around the world converge to participate in "uncomfortable conversations" and theorize solutions to systemic legal issues. 2013 marks the beginning of the 30th year of operation for the Feminism and Legal Theory Project, and a special retrospective series of workshops reflecting on the past 30 years of feminist legal theory. Workshops over the 2013-2014 academic year will treat sex and reproduction, the family, violence, and workplaces.
