What became known as the \"<a href=\"/wiki/Nuremberg_Trials\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Nuremberg Trials\">Nuremberg Trials</a>\", when the victorious allied forces extended criminal justice to Japanese and German soldiers and their leaders for <a href=\"/wiki/War_crimes\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"War crimes\">war crimes</a> committed during the war, marked the genesis of transitional justice. The field gained momentum and coherence during the 1980s and onwards, beginning with the trials of former members of the military juntas in <a href=\"/wiki/Greece\" title=\"Greece\">Greece</a> (1975), and <a href=\"/wiki/Argentina\" title=\"Argentina\">Argentina</a> (<a href=\"/wiki/Trial_of_the_Juntas\" title=\"Trial of the Juntas\">Trial of the Juntas</a>, 1983). The focus of transitional justice in the 1970s and 1980s was on criminal justice with a focus on <a href=\"/wiki/Human_rights\" title=\"Human rights\">human rights</a> promotion. This led to a worldwide focus and progressive rise of human rights regime culminating in the establishments of international human rights laws and conventions.\n</p><p>The emphasis of transitional justice was on how abuses of human rights get treated during political transition: legal and criminal prosecution. As noted earlier, the universal conceptions of \"justice\" became the platform on which transitional justice was premised. The field in its early <a href=\"/wiki/Epistemology\" title=\"Epistemology\">epistemology</a>, thus, assumed jurisprudence of human rights. As a result, the initial literature on transitional justice was dominated by lawyers, law, and legal rights: defining laws, and processes on how to deal with human rights abuse and holding people accountable. Thus, transitional justice has its roots in both the human rights movement and in international human rights and humanitarian law. These origins in the human rights movement have rendered transitional justice \u201cself-consciously victim-centric\u201d.\n</p><p>The late 1980s and early 1990s saw a shift in the focus of transitional justice. Informed by the worldwide wave of democratization, particularly the <a href=\"/wiki/Third_Wave_Democracy\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Third Wave Democracy\">third wave</a>, transitional justice reemerged as a new field of study in democratization. Transitional justice broadened its scope from more narrow questions of <a href=\"/wiki/Jurisprudence\" title=\"Jurisprudence\">jurisprudence</a> to political considerations of developing stable democratic institutions and renewing civil society. Studies by scholars on the transition from autocratic regimes to democratic ones have integrated the transitional justice framework into an examination of the political processes inherent to democratic change. The challenges of democratization in transitional periods are many: settling past accounts without derailing democratic progress, developing judicial or third-party fora capable of resolving conflicts, reparations, and creating memorials and developing educational curricula that redress cultural lacunae and unhealed trauma.\n</p><p>It is clear that elements of transitional justice have broken the initial mold of post-war jurisprudence. The transitional justice framework has benefited from democratic activists who sought to bolster fledgling democracies and bring them into line with the moral and legal obligations articulated in the international human rights consensus.\n</p><p>One particular innovation is the appearance of <a href=\"/wiki/Truth_commission\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Truth commission\">truth commissions</a>. Beginning with Argentina in 1983, Chile in 1990, and South Africa in 1995, truth commissions have become a symbol of transitional justice, appearing in transitional societies in Latin America, Africa, Asia, and Eastern Europe. However, several attempts to create a regional truth commission in the former <a href=\"/wiki/Yugoslavia\" title=\"Yugoslavia\">Yugoslavia</a> (REKOM) have failed due to political obstacles. Recent years have also seen proposals for truth and reconciliation commissions in conflict zones of the Middle East and it is likely that these transitional justice institutions will someday figure prominently in <a href=\"/wiki/Israel\" title=\"Israel\">Israel</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/State_of_Palestine\" title=\"State of Palestine\">Palestine</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Iraq\" title=\"Iraq\">Iraq</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Lebanon\" title=\"Lebanon\">Lebanon</a>, and the <a href=\"/wiki/Kurdistan\" title=\"Kurdistan\">Kurdish regions</a>.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research\" title=\"Wikipedia:No original research\"><span title=\"The material near this tag possibly contains original research.

While most countries pursued programs based on dismissals of compromised personnel and comprehensive screening tools, other countries implemented more inclusive methods allowing discredited personnel a second chance.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>As a link between transition and justice, the concept of transitional justice transformed in the late 1940s to assume a broader perspective of comprehensive examination of the society in transition from a retrospective to a prospective position with democratic consolidation as one of the primary objectives. Scholars and practitioners of democratization have come to a common conclusion on the general principles of a transitional justice framework: that national strategies to confront past abuses, depending on the specific nature and context of the country in question, can contribute to accountability, an end to impunity, reconstruct state\u2013citizen relations, and the creation of democratic institutions.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Objectives\">Objectives</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Transitional_justice&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Objectives\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The primary objective of a transitional justice policy is to end the culture of <a href=\"/wiki/Impunity\" title=\"Impunity\">impunity</a> and establish the rule of law in a context of democratic governance. The legal and human rights protection roots of transitional justice impute certain legal obligations on states undergoing transitions. It challenges such societies to strive for a society where respect for human rights is the core and accountability is routinely practiced as the main goals. In the context of these goals, transitional justice aims at:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Halting ongoing human rights abuses;</li>\n<li>Investigating past crimes;</li>\n<li>Identifying those responsible for human rights violations;</li>\n<li>Imposing sanctions on those responsible (where it can);</li>\n<li>Providing reparations to victims;</li>\n<li>Preventing future abuses;</li>\n<li>Security Sector Reform;</li>\n<li>Preserving and enhancing peace; and</li>\n<li>Fostering individual and national reconciliation.</li></ul>\n<p>In general, therefore, one can identify eight broad objectives that transitional justice aims to serve: establishing the truth, providing victims a public platform, holding perpetrators accountable, strengthening the rule of law, providing victims with compensation, effectuating institutional reform, promoting reconciliation, and promoting public deliberation.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Strategies\">Strategies</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Transitional_justice&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Strategies\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In order to be effective, transitional justice measures should be part of a holistic approach.

Mechanisms, such as trials, truth commissions, reparations, lustration, museums, and other memory sites have been employed either single-handedly or in a combined form to address past human rights violations. Diverse studies ranging from the decision-making process of a choice of strategy through to the implementation of the transitional justice policy and impacts on the transition and future stability of the society in question have been produced by scholars in recent years. One illuminating study in particular that has documented the dramatic new trend of transitional justice and democratization is by Kathryn Sikkink and Carrie Booth Walling (2006). In their research paper described as the \"justice cascade\", Sikkink and Walling conducting analysis of truth commissions and human rights trials occurring throughout the world from 1979 to 2004 revealed a significant increase in the judicialization of world politics both regionally and internationally. Of the 192 countries surveyed, 34 have used truth commissions, and 50 had at least one transitional human rights trial.\n</p><p>More than two-thirds of the approximately 85 new and/or transitional countries during that period used either trials or truth commissions as a transitional justice mechanism; over half tried some form of judicial proceedings. Thus, the use of a truth commission and/or human rights trials among transitional countries is not an isolated or marginal practice, but a widespread social practice occurring in the bulk of transitional countries.\n</p><p>Since its emergence, transitional justice has encountered numerous challenges such as identifying victims, deciding whether to punish superiors or middle agents, avoiding a \"victor\u2019s justice\", and finding adequate resources for compensation, trial, or institutional reform. Also, the transitional period may only result in a tenuous peace or fragile democracy. As has been noted in the discourse on transition to democracy, the dilemma has always been for new regimes to promote accountability for past abuses without risking a smooth transition to democracy. In addition, existing judicial system might be weak, <a href=\"/wiki/Political_corruption\" title=\"Political corruption\">corrupt</a>, or ineffective and in effect make achieving any viable justice difficult. Observers of transitional justice application and processes, such as <a href=\"/wiki/Makau_W._Mutua\" title=\"Makau W. Mutua\">Makau W. Mutua</a> (2000) emphasized on the difficulties of achieving actual justice through one of the most prominent mechanisms of transitional justice, trials. Commenting on the international tribunal established in <a href=\"/wiki/Rwanda\" title=\"Rwanda\">Rwanda</a> in 1994, he argued that it \u201cserves to deflect responsibility, to assuage the consciences of states which were unwilling to stop the <a href=\"/wiki/Genocide\" title=\"Genocide\">genocide</a>... [and] largely masks the illegitimacy of the <a href=\"/wiki/Tutsi\" title=\"Tutsi\">Tutsi</a> regime\u201d. In sum, Matua argues that criminal tribunals such as those in Rwanda and Yugoslavia are \u201cless meaningful if they cannot be applied or enforced without prejudice to redress transgressions or unless they have a deterrent effect such as behavior modification on the part of would be perpetrators\u201d.\n</p><p>More recently, <a href=\"/wiki/Lyal_S._Sunga\" title=\"Lyal S. Sunga\">Lyal S. Sunga</a> has argued that unless truth commissions are set up and conducted according to international human rights law, international criminal law and international humanitarian law, they risk conflicting or undermining criminal prosecutions, whether these prosecutions are supposed to be carried out at the national or international levels. He contends that this risk is particularly pronounced where truth commissions employ amnesties, and especially blanket amnesties to pardon perpetrators of serious crimes. On the other hand, criminal prosecutions should be better tailored to focus on victims and to place events in proper perspective.  Sunga therefore proposes ten principles for making truth and national reconciliation commissions fully complementary to criminal prosecutions in a way that conforms fully to international law.<sup id=\"cite_ref-18\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-18\">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>This type of critique of transitional justice mechanisms could cause some scholars and policymakers to wonder which of the objectives outlined above are most important to achieve, and even if they are achievable. Truth commissions could be characterized as a second-best alternative and also an affront to rule of law, because of the possibility that amnesty and indemnities will be made exchange for truth. These sets of challenges can raise critical questions for transitional justice in its application. Questions and issues, such as: Can the \"truth\" ever really be established? Can all victims be given compensation or a public platform? Can all perpetrators be held accountable? Or is it sufficient to acknowledge that atrocities were committed and that victims should be compensated for their suffering?\n</p><p>Also, one might argue that too narrow a focus on the challenges of the field runs the risk of making transitional justice seem meaningless. However transitional justice aims at an ongoing search for truth, justice, forgiveness, and healing, and efforts undertaken within it help people to live alongside former enemies. Simply put, \u201cthe past must be addressed in order to reach the future\u201d. Thus, even if the impact or reach of transitional justice seems marginal, the end result is worth the effort.\n</p><p>Another way of assessing attempts at transitional justice is to say that decision makers may have less control over the methods used to pursue such policies than they imagine. In fact, whatever their wishes, they may not be able to prevent such policies at all. As A.&#160;James McAdams has demonstrated in his book, <i>Judging the Past in Unified Germany</i> (2001), West German policymakers such as former chancellor <a href=\"/wiki/Helmut_Kohl\" title=\"Helmut Kohl\">Helmut Kohl</a> wanted to close public access to the files of East Germany's secret police, the <a href=\"/wiki/Stasi\" title=\"Stasi\">Stasi</a>, but pressures from East German dissidents prevented them from doing so.\n</p><p>Another challenge is the tension between peace and justice, which arises the conflicting goals of achieving peace and justice in the aftermath of a society\u2019s emergence from conflict. Though it is generally unanimous that both goals are integral to achieving reconciliation, practitioners often disagree about which goal should be pursed first: justice or peace?<sup id=\"cite_ref-19\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-19\">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup> Proponents of the \u201cjustice\u201d school of thought argue that if all perpetrators of human rights abuses do not stand trial, impunity for crimes will continue into the new regime, preventing it from fully completing a transition from conflict.<sup id=\"cite_ref-20\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-20\">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup> The \"peace\" school of thought, however, argues that the only way to effectively end violence is by granting amnesties and brokering negotiations to persuade criminals to lay down their arms.<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.economist.com/debate/days/view/744\">[1]</a> Examples such as <a href=\"/wiki/Northern_Ireland\" title=\"Northern Ireland\">Northern Ireland</a> illustrate how selective amnesties can cease conflict.\n</p><p>Recent trends in the post-conflict field have tended to favor the \u201cjustice\u201d school of thought, maintaining that only if justice is dutifully served to victims of the conflict can civil war will be prevented from recurring. A 2011 debate in <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Economist\" title=\"The Economist\">The Economist</a></i> determined in its concluding polls that 76% of the debate participants agreed with the motion that achieving peace can occur only through implementing justice mechanisms.<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.economist.com/debate/days/view/747\">[2]</a>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Literary_Applications\">Literary Applications</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Transitional_justice&amp;action=edit&amp;section=13\" title=\"Edit section: Literary Applications\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Literary scholars and historians have begun to use the concept of transitional justice to reexamine historical events and texts. Christopher N. Warren, for instance, has applied transitional justice to pre-<a href=\"/wiki/Restoration_England\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Restoration England\">Restoration England</a>, claiming that it helps explain how Anglican royalists convinced Presbyterians to assent to a restoration of the monarchy.<sup id=\"cite_ref-21\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-21\">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup> Warren also argues that English poet <a href=\"/wiki/John_Milton\" title=\"John Milton\">John Milton</a> \u201ccan be seen as an early critic of transitional justice,\u201d using the allegory of Sin and Death in his epic poem <a href=\"/wiki/Paradise_Lost\" title=\"Paradise Lost\">Paradise Lost</a> to complicate \u201coverly-rosy\u201d depictions of transitional justice.<sup id=\"cite_ref-22\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-22\">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Future_agenda\">Future agenda</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Transitional_justice&amp;action=edit&amp;section=14\" title=\"Edit section: Future agenda\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Although transitional justice is engulfed by many critical challenges in addition to the difficulty in measuring its impact, given the number of other factors in any given country\u2019s experience over time, human rights trials or truth commissions need not have a negative effect on human rights practices. This makes transitional justice viable, especially in this age of state-building and democracy promotion in post-conflict societies. In fact, Sikkink and Walling\u2019s comparison of human rights conditions before and after trials in <a href=\"/wiki/Latin_America\" title=\"Latin America\">Latin American</a> countries with two or more trial years showed that eleven of the fourteen countries had better Political Terror Scale (PTS) ratings after trials. Latin American countries that had both a truth commission and human rights trials improved more on their PTS ratings than countries that only had trials. These statistics indicate that transitional justice mechanisms are associated with countries\u2019 improving their human rights practices. Each state that employs transitional justice mechanisms will have to determine which mechanisms to use to best achieve the targeted goals. In order to avoid causing disappointment amongst victims, the state should also ensure that the public is well-informed about the goals and limits of those mechanisms.\n</p><p>Transitional justice shows no signs of decreasing in use. Indeed, the incorporation of transitional justice policies, tools and programs in peacebuilding and democratization process operations by the <a href=\"/wiki/United_Nations\" title=\"United Nations\">United Nations</a> (UN) and in the programs by many local and international democracy promotion organizations, including, the Stockholm-based International Institute for Electoral Assistance and Democracy (International IDEA) and a host of others as well as the establishments of other international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) and networks such as the <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.ictj.org\">International Center for Transitional Justice</a> (ICTJ) and the  <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.transitionaljustice.net\">African Transitional Justice Research Network</a> (ATJRN) and research centers like the <a href=\"/wiki/Transitional_Justice_Institute\" title=\"Transitional Justice Institute\">Transitional Justice Institute</a> are strong manifestations of how well placed transitional justice has become a feature in the discourse of transitional politics in the 21st century. Academic publications such as the <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.ijtj.oxfordjournals.org\">International Journal of Transitional Justice</a> are also contributing towards building an interdisciplinary field with the hope that future innovations are tailored for a specific state\u2019s situation and will contribute towards political transitions that address the past as well as establish guarantees for respect of human rights and democracy.\n</p><p>The <a href=\"/wiki/World_Bank\" title=\"World Bank\">World Bank</a>'s \"2011 World Development Report on Conflict, Security, and Development\u201d links transitional justice to security and development.<sup id=\"cite_ref-23\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-23\">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup> It explores how countries can avoid cycles of violence and emphasizes the importance of transitional justice, arguing that it is one of the \u201c<a href=\"/wiki/Signalling_(economics)\" title=\"Signalling (economics)\">signaling mechanisms</a>\u201d that governments can use to show that they are breaking away from past practices. It also argues that transitional justice measures can send signals about the importance of accountability and to improve institutional capacity.<sup id=\"cite_ref-24\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-24\">&#91;24&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In September 2011, the <a href=\"/wiki/International_Center_for_Transitional_Justice\" title=\"International Center for Transitional Justice\">International Center for Transitional Justice</a> (ICTJ) published a report advocating the need to understand traditional transitional justice measures from a child's perspective. The report identifies children as a large demographic too often excluded from traditional transitional justice measures.
