A robot lawyer or a robo-lawyer refers to a legal AI application that can perform tasks that are typically done by paralegals or young associates at law firms. However, there is some debate on the correctness of the term. Some commentators say that legal AI is technically speaking neither a lawyer nor a robot and should not be referred to as such.  Other commentators believe that the term can be misleading and note that the robot lawyer of the future won't be one all-encompassing application but a collection of specialized bots for various tasks.  Some legal AI solutions are developed and marketed directly to the customers or consumers, whereas other applications are tools for the attorneys at law firms. Lawbots.info has a catalogue of automated legal AI services that have been developed for the direct distribution to the public.  One notable legal AI solution for the law firms is ROSS, which has been used by US law firms to assist in legal research,  but there are already hundreds of legal AI solutions that operate in multitude of ways varying in sophistication and dependence on scripted algorithms.
