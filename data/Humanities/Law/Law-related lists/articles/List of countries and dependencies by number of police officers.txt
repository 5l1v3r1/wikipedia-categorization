 The following list compares the size of national police forces and police per head. Note that in some countries, particularly those organised under a federal system, such as the US and Canada, the total number of police officers may be much greater because sub-national governments employ significant numbers. In 2006, an analysis by the United Nations indicates an approximate median of 300 police officers per 100,000 inhabitants.  Only nine countries disclosed values lower than 100 officers per 100,000 inhabitants.  The highest median of police officers – around 400 – was observed in West Asia, Eastern and Southern Europe.  The median of police officers per population remained stable between 2002–2006, after an increase between 1995 and 2002.
