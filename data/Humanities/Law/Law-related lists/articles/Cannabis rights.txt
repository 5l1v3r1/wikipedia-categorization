Cannabis rights or marijuana rights are individual civil and human rights that vary by jurisdiction considerably.   The rights of people who consume cannabis include the right to be free from employment discrimination and housing discrimination.    Anti-cannabis laws include civil infractions and fines, imprisonment, and even the death penalty.  Until the twentieth century, anyone could grow and consume cannabis.  By the mid twentieth century, possession of marijuana was a crime in every U.S. state and most countries. In 1996, the passing of Proposition 215 by California voters restored limited rights for medical cannabis patients in the state. Other states and countries have since then joined California in guarding rights of cannabis consumers.  In the United States, much is unclear about cannabis rights because despite state laws, cannabis remains illegal for all purposes, at the federal level, and consequently cannabis consumers do not belong to a protected class. Courts will address the issues surrounding housing and employment law, and disability discrimination.
