This is a list— by country — of the highest court (supreme court) in each country. Some countries have more than one "supreme" court. An asterisk (*) indicates that the court is not independent of either the legislature and/or executive of that country. There are a number of international courts that are the highest courts of appeal for the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS), European Union (EU), and some of the countries of the Commonwealth of Nations respectively. However, the members of those organisations do sometimes have high courts of their own and their jurisdiction may be limited: for example the EU's court of justice can only interpret EU law and treaties, domestic cases cannot be appealed.
