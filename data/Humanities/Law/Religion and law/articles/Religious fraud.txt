Religious fraud is a term used for civil   or criminal fraud carried out in the name of a religion   or within a religion, e.g. false claims to being kosher   or tax fraud.  A specific form of religious fraud is pious fraud (Latin: pia fraus), whereby one employs lies and/or deception in order to convince others of the truth of one's own religion or specific religious claims. Sometimes these involve 'white lies': the perpetrator may think it more important to make others accept a certain belief than that the method is truthful; this end justifies the means of a lie.  A well-known example is the Shroud of Turin, a late Medieval fabrication that supposedly was the clothing in which Jesus would have been buried in the 1st century.
