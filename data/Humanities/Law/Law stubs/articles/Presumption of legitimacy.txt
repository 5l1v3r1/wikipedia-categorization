The "presumption of legitimacy" is a common law rule of evidence that states that a child born within the subsistence of a marriage is deemed to be the child of the husband. Paternity (law) is considered an important issue in determining the rules of succession.  Illegitimate children were originally excluded from royal succession, hereditary titles, and property.
