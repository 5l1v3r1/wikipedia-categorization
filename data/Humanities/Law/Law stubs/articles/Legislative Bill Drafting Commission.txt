The New York Legislative Bill Drafting Commission (LBDC) aids the New York State Legislature in drafting legislation; advises as to the constitutionality, consistency or effect of proposed legislation; conducts research; and publishes and maintains the documents of the Legislature.   It is composed of two commissioners. The LBDC maintains the Legislative Retrieval System (LRS) containing the full record of Legislature activity, for which it charges $2500 per session for access.    The LRS version of the Consolidated Laws is published under statutory authority and is available online but is not certified pursuant to Public Officers Law § 70-b.  The LBDC also publishes the Laws of New York.  The LBDC is composed of two commissioners, the Commissioner for Administration and the Commissioner for Operations, each appointed jointly by the Temporary President of the Senate and the Speaker of the Assembly.  As of  August 2014[update], the commissioners were Randall G. Bluth, appointed by Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver in 2001, and John J. Conway, III, appointed by Senate Republican Majority Leader Dean Skelos.
