The ruin of the Delphinion in Miletus is still mostly standing. A rectangular temenos , the remains of the temple at the site date back to as early as the fifth century B.C.E.  Still present are a rectangular altar with volute acroteria, as well as a few other round marble altars. An "annual Spring procession which went from Miletus to the Temple of Apollo at Didyma began at the Delphinion"   Inscriptions found on the walls of the Delphinion tell us the site also served as the city archive.  The Delphinion in Athens near the Acropolis contained a court of law, which was used to try homicide cases where the accused had claimed the defence of justifiable homicide.
