An originating application is the first, provisional, or primary application in any legal process, such as a lawsuit, application for a real estate mortgage, patent, or bankruptcy petition. In Australia, it is the first claim made in its Supreme Court.  In England, it is a term describing the initial bankruptcy petition.   It may also be used in England for administrative appeals.  In the United States, an originating application is usually reserved for the first form filed to secure a bank loan or mortgage.
