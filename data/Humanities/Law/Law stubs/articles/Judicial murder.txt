Judicial murder is the unjustified use of capital punishment. The Oxford English Dictionary describes it as "death inflicted by process of law, capital punishment, esp. considered to be unjust or cruel".  An early use of the term occurs in Northleigh's Natural Allegiance of 1688; "He would willingly make this Proceeding against the Knight but a sort of Judicial Murder".  In 1777 Voltaire used the comparable term of assassins juridiques ("judicial murderers"). The term was used in German (Justizmord) in 1782  by August Ludwig von Schlözer in reference to the execution of Anna Göldi. In a footnote, he explains the term as In 1932, the term is also used by Justice Sutherland in Powell v. Alabama when establishing the right to a court-appointed attorney in all capital cases: Hermann Mostar (1956) defends the extension of the term to un-premeditated miscarriages of justice where an innocent suffers the death penalty.
