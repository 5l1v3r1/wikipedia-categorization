Against DRM 2.0 is a free copyleft license for artworks. It is the first free content license that contains a clause about related rights and a clause against DRM. The first clause authorizes licensee to exercise related rights; the second clause prevents the use of DRM: if licensor uses DRM, the license is not applicable to the work; if licensee uses DRM, license is automatically void.
