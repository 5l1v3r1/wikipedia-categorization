The High Anti-Corruption Court of Ukraine (Ukrainian: Вищий антикорупційний суд України) is to be established before the end of 2018.   Cases concerning corruption in Ukraine will be bought directly to this court.  The jurisdiction of the court covers crimes that caused damage wearth at least USD 31 thousand.  Appeals will be considered by a completely separate Appeal Chamber of the High Anti-Corruption Court.  The court will have 35 judges appointed and at least 10 of them appointed to the Appeals Chamber.  These judges and persons living with them, spouses, parents, brothers and sisters, grandparents, spouse’s parents, grandchildren, adopted children and foster parents shall have 24/7 protection.  The judges will be elected by the High Judicial Qualifications Commission with the help of the Public Council of International Experts (a new body of six people that may consist of foreigners and Ukrainians).  In December 2016 then Minister of Justice Pavlo Petrenko said that a relevant bill for creating a special anti-corruption court was ready to be sent to the Ukrainian parliament.  Parliament saw the draft in December 2017.  Parliament adopted the final version of this law on 7 June 2018.  The law on the High Anti-Corruption Court of Ukraine came into force on 14 June 2018.  Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko signed the law "On the establishment of the High Anti-Corruption Court" on 26 June 2018.  The law had undergone about 2,000 amendments during its passage. The International Monetary Fund will have to assess if it is sufficient to meet its anti-corruption requirements to release the next tranche of money under its $17.5 billion cash-for-reforms agreement.
