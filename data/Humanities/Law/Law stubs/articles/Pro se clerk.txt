A pro se clerk is a clerk of the court, employed by the court and found in the courthouse. This clerk assists people appearing pro se (without lawyers) to participate in legal actions by providing forms which need to be filled out and explaining some basic rules. While pro se clerks may or may not be lawyers themselves, they are prohibited from providing legal or strategic advice since in no case do they represent the pro se litigant.
