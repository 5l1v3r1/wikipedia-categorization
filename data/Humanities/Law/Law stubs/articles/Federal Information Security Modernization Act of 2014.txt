The Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (Pub.L. 113-283, S. 2521; commonly referred to as FISMA Reform) was signed into federal law by President Barack Obama on December 18, 2014.  Passed as a response to the increasing amount of cyber attacks on the federal government, it amended existing laws to enable the federal government to better respond to cyber attacks on departments and agencies.   The original legislation was proposed by House Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Darrell Issa and co-sponsored by the Committee's Ranking Member Elijah Cummins in 2012. The bill was passed the U.S. House of Representatives on a vote of 416-0.
