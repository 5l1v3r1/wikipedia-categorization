Ealdred v Malet was a court case of early English law between Ealdred, the archbishop of York and William Malet the High Sheriff of Yorkshire about 1068.    Ealdred was seeking the return of lands taken by the Sherriff during the conquest.  As a Viceroy of William,  Ealdred already had the kings ear  so in  keeping with the mille of the time,  the plaint was more informal than would be expected under the Common Law that developed under Williams grandson.  The goods were returned and the High Sheriff of Yorkshire chastened. The court cases is important as it can be viewed as a part of a large collection of pleadings against a process of Nomanization that within a decade saw 64% of land in England consolidated into the hands of just 150 individuals, and many of the nobility deprived of their estates.
