Compulsory prosecution is an aspect of certain justice systems in which the prosecutor is required to press charges when he has sufficient evidence to support a conviction. This system is used in Germany.  It has also been required by the Constitution of Italy since 1948.  The lack of such a requirement in the United States tends to encourage plea bargaining.
