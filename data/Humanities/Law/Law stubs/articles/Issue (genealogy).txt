"Issue" typically means a person's lineal descendantsâ€”all genetic descendants of a person, regardless of degree.  Issue is a narrower category than heirs, which includes spouses, ancestors, and collaterals (siblings, cousins, aunts, and uncles).  This meaning of issue arises most often in wills and trusts.  A person who has no living lineal descendants is said to have died without issue.
