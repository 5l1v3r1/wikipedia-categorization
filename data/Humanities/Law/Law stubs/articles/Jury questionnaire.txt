A jury questionnaire is a form that potential jurors fill out prior to voir dire. They are used in virtually all high-profile cases.  Many jurisdictions "qualify" jurors by selecting only those who receive, complete, and return jury questionnaires. Some studies have found that large percentages of jury questionnaires are returned as undeliverable or are not returned by the recipients.
