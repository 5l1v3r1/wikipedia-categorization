Public Domain Mark (PDM) is a symbol used to indicate that a work is free of known copyright restrictions and therefore in the public domain. It is analogous to the copyright symbol, which is commonly used to indicate as copyright notice that a work is copyrighted. The Public Domain Mark was developed by Creative Commons.
