CaseMap was introduced 1998 as relational database software for law offices to store and retrieve evidence and sources of evidence in litigation. It includes database tables (the program's documentation refers to them as spreadsheets) for facts, issues, documents, physical evidence, depositions, pleadings, persons, organizations, places, and other types of data. The program's documentation refers to these types of data as objects. Using the program involves linking the various sources of evidence (e.g., documents, depositions, and persons) to facts that are relevant in the case and to the issues to be decided in the case. The facts table can be sorted by date to provide a chronology of facts.     The use of large volumes of digital evidence and e-discovery in modern litigation has led law offices to increase their use of litigation support programs such as CaseMap.     CaseMap is owned by LexisNexis. The current version is CaseMap 13.
