  Brian Andr√© Doyle was a lawyer who was Attorney General of Fiji and Chief Justice of Zambia. He served in Fiji as Solicitor General from 1948 to 1951,  and as Attorney General from 1949 to 1956  (his tenure in these two offices evidently overlapped). Later he was Chief Justice of Zambia from 1969 to 1975. He went on to serve two terms as a Judge of the Botswana Court of Appeal (1973 to 1979, and 1988 to 1991). He died in Brazil at the home of his son. He also had a daughter there.
