The Helium Privatization Act of 1996 is a United States statute that ordered the US government to sell much of the National Helium Reserve. The law was described by critics as a "fiasco" due to the formula-based sale price being significantly lower than the market price for helium.   The bill was amended in 2013 to use an auction to sell helium.
