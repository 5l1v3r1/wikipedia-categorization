In England, Scotland, and Wales the highway authorities for trunk roads (which include all motorways) are, respectively, Highways England, Transport Scotland, and the Welsh Government. For all other roads and public rights of way, the Highway Authority is usually the county council or unitary authority for a particular area. District councils may carry out some of the functions of a highway authority, but these are usually delegated to them by their county council. Transport for London is  the highway authority for all GLA roads (under the Highways Act 1980). for more information on unitary authorities and county and district councils.

In the U.S., a highway authority is now usually called a department of transportation, owing to the expanded responsibility for mass transport like passenger rail and even airports and ferry service.  Some U.S. states also have separate highway authorities for toll roads, sometimes the responsibility of a regional government or metropolitan government rather than a state government. For example, the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority is an instrumentality and administrative agency of the State of Illinois. The Authority has the power to collect and raise tolls, and is responsible for the maintenance and construction of tollway roads and related signage (including electronic message boards, used for driving-time notices, Amber Alerts, and other notifications). The Tollway also supervises and manages the seven Illinois Tollway oases (rest areas).  The Illinois DOT manages other state roads.
