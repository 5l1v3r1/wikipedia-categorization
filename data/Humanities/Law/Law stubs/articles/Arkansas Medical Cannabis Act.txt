The Arkansas Medical Cannabis Act (AMCA) is a proposed legislative act to appear on the 2016 general election ballot as an initiative in the U.S. state of Arkansas. According to a 2015 survey, 84% of Arkansas voters favored medical cannabis legalization, leading some to conclude passage of the 2016 act is likely.  The act has a provision to collect sales tax and apportions some of the revenue to subsidize low-income medical cannabis patients.  The wording of the initiative's title was approved by the Arkansas Attorney General in August, 2014, allowing the process of collecting signatures for the initiative to begin.  The sponsor of the act, Arkansans for Compassionate Care, submitted 117,469 petition signatures to the state authorities for verification in June, 2016.  It was certified for the ballot on July 7.
