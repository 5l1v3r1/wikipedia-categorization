A residence permit    (less commonly residency permit) is a document or card required in some regions, allowing a foreign national to reside in a country for a fixed or indefinite length of time. These may be permits for temporary residency, or permanent residency. The exact rules vary between regions. In some cases (e.g. the UK ) a temporary residence permit is required to extend a stay past some threshold, and can be an intermediate step to applying for permanent residency. Residency status may be granted for a number of reasons and the criteria for acceptance as a resident may change over time. In New Zealand the current range of conditions include being a skilled migrant, a retired parent of a New Zealand National, an investor and a number of others   Some countries have adopted biometric residence permits, which are cards including embedded machine readable information and RFID NFC capable chips.  See Permanent residency in Canada In Italy the residence permit (permesso di soggiorno) is released by the state policy (Polizia di Stato); it must be requested by the immigrant to be allowed to reside in the country  for more than eight days, or more than ninety days if having a travel visa (visto d'ingresso) for tourism. It is not required for European citizens. See Permanent residency in Singapore See Permanent residence (United States)
