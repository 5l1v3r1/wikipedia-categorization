The O’Connor Justice Prize, named for former United States Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, was established in 2014 to raise visibility for rule-of-law initiatives; recognize people who have made extraordinary contributions to advancing the rule of law, justice, and human rights; and to honor O’Connor’s legacy.  A group led by former Arizona Supreme Court Justice Ruth McGregor,  who served as a law clerk for O’Connor from 1981 to 1982,  developed the prize to honor O’Connor’s legacy. The prize is administered by the Sandra Day O’Connor College of Law at Arizona State University.
