Adhesion procedure, adhesive procedure or ancillary proceedings is a procedure through which a court of law can rule on compensation for the victim of a criminal offense. Rather than pursuing damages in a separate civil action, the victim files a civil claim against the offender as a part of a criminal trial. This system exists in some civil law jurisdictions, including Austria,  the Czech Republic,  Germany,  the Netherlands,  and Slovakia.
