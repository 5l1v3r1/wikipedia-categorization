A marital life estate is, in the common law tradition of the United States and Great Britain, a life estate held by the spouse (husband or wife) or widowed spouse, for the duration of that spouse's life. The marital life estate may be created by operation of law, agreement, contract, will, deed, or court order, such as a divorce decree or judgment.
