The Anglican Communion as a whole, unlike the Roman Catholic Church, does not have a centralised canon law of its own.   Each of the autonomous member churches of the communion, however, does have a canonical system.  Some, such as the Church of England have an ancient, highly developed canon law while others, such as the Episcopal Church in the United States have more recently developed canonical systems originally based on the English canon law.
