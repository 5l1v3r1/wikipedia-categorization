Poverty law is the body of law which concerns the rights of low-income individuals and families to access government benefits.  In the United States, these government benefits are provided by the federal government as well as by state governments.  Federal government benefits include Medicaid; cash public assistance (more commonly known as Welfare); and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) program, previously known as the food stamps program. Poverty law frequently involves questions of administrative law, civil rights law, constitutional law, employment law, and health law.
