A loophole is an ambiguity or inadequacy in a system, such as a law or security, which can be used to circumvent or otherwise avoid the purpose, implied or explicitly stated, of the system. It would be thus connected with a well-known in civil law legal systems intra legem gap, interpretational gap or indeterminacy gap.     Originally, the word means an arrowslit, a narrow vertical window in a wall through which an archer could shoot. Loopholes are distinct from lacunae, although the two terms are often used interchangeably.  In a loophole, a law addressing a certain issue exists, but can be legally circumvented due to a technical defect in the law. A lacuna, on the other hand, is a situation whereby no law exists in the first place to address that particular issue. Loopholes are searched for and used strategically in a variety of circumstances, including elections, politics, taxes, the criminal justice system, or in breaches of security.
