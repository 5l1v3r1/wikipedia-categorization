Joseph Grimberg was a Singaporean prominent lawyer and former Supreme Court judge. Grimberg joined Drew & Napier when he was called to the Singapore Bar in 1957. He was a senior partner at the law firm from 1967 to 1987, when he was appointed Judicial Commissioner of the Supreme Court in 1987. In 1989, he re-joined Drew & Napier as a consultant. In 1997, Grimberg became one of the first lawyers in Singapore to be appointed Senior Counsel.       Grimberg died on August 17, 2017, at the age of 84. In a tribute to Grimberg, Law Minister K. Shanmugam called him "one of the best Singapore has ever seen", "a consummate gentleman, both at the Bar, and outside" and one who had "made a difference to the legal profession in many ways". Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon described him as "the finest of his time and quite frankly he was peerless".
