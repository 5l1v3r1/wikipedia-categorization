The constable is also entitled to arrest anyone guilty of an offence or anyone who he reasonably believes to be guilty of an offence. However, the constable must have reasonable grounds that any of the following reasons make it necessary to arrest the person in question: to enable the real name or address of the person in question to be ascertained, or to prevent the person in question -\n</p>\n<ul><li>causing physical injury to himself/herself or any other person,</li>\n<li>suffering physical injury,</li>\n<li>causing loss of or damage to property,</li>\n<li>committing an offence against public decency (provided members of the public going about their normal business cannot reasonably be expected to avoid the person in question),</li>\n<li>causing an unlawful obstruction of the highway.</li>\n<li>to protect a child or other vulnerable person from the person in question,</li>\n<li>to allow the prompt and effective investigation of the offence or of the conduct of the person in question,</li>\n<li>to prevent any prosecution for the offence from being hindered by the disappearance of the person in question.</li></ul>\n<p>Section 24A has similar provisions for <a href=\"/wiki/Citizen%27s_arrest\" title=\"Citizen&#39;s arrest\">citizens' arrests</a> but the reasons permitted for arrest by anyone other than a constable are limited to preventing the person in question from causing injury to the arrestor, themselves or to others; preventing property damage; or preventing the person in question from making off before a constable can assume responsibility for him.\n</p><p>The definition of an arrest, however, is contained in the judgement of <a href=\"/wiki/Lord_Diplock\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Lord Diplock\">Lord Diplock</a> in <i>Holgate-Mohammed v Duke</i>, where he stated that an arrest is \"a continuing act; it starts with the arrester taking a person into his custody, (sc. by action or words restraining him from moving anywhere beyond the arrester's control), and it continues until the person so restrained is either released from custody or, having been brought before a magistrate, is remanded in custody by the magistrate's judicial act.\" <sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In the Philippine setting, a peace officer or a private person may, without a warrant, arrest a person:\n</p><p>a.   When, in his presence, the person to be arrested has committed, is actually committing, or is attempting to commit an offense;\n</p><p>b.   When an offense has just been committed and he has probable cause to believe, based on personal knowledge of facts or circumstances, that the person to be committed has committed it;\n</p><p>c.   When the person to be arrested is a prisoner who has escaped from a penal establishment or place where he is serving final judgment or temporarily confined while his case is pending, or has escaped while being transferred from one confinement area to another;\n</p><p>d.   Where the accused released on bail attempts to leave the country without court permission;\n</p><p>e.
