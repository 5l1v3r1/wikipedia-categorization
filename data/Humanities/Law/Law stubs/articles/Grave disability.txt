Grave disability is a legal status in the state of California,  defined as when a person's mental disorder prevents him from providing for his own basic life-sustaining needs, such as an inability to provide for his own food, clothing, or shelter.  Grave disability can be the basis for civil commitment if there are no existing resources for such provision.
