The Intracorporate Conspiracy Doctrine is a common-law doctrine in American law that states that members of a corporation, such as employees, cannot be held to have conspired among themselves, because the corporation and its agents constitute a single actor for purposes of law. Therefore, it is reasoned that there is no plurality of actors needed to constitute a conspiracy.   However, the doctrine is held not to apply in some areas of law. Furthermore, in some areas of law, is not uniformly applied the same way throughout the federal circuits.
