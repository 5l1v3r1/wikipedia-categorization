A Legislative referral (or legislative referendum) is a form of referendum in which a legislature puts proposed legislation up for popular vote (either voluntarily or, in the case of a constitutional amendment, as a necessary part of the procedure), rather than through the initiative or referendum process.[inconsistent] These ballot measures, depending on the state in question, can either amend a state's constitution or enact a change in a state statute. Bond issues are a common type of legislatively referred ballot measure. In some states, such as Oregon, if the state legislature in both chambers vote to put a measure on the ballot, the governor is not allowed to veto their action.
