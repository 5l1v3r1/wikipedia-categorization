Law Latin, sometimes written L.L. or L. Lat.,  and sometimes derisively called Dog Latin,  is a form of Latin used in legal contexts. While some of the vocabulary does come from Latin, many of the words and much of the vocabulary stem from English.  Law Latin may also be seen as consisting of a mixture of English, French and Latin words superimposed over an English syntax.  Law Latin was the language in which the legal opinions of English courts were recorded at least until the reign of George II. It was also used as the language of writs, royal charters, letters patent and many other legal instruments. As late as 1867, Law Latin was still in use in England and Scotland for some legal instruments.
