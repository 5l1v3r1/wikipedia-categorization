In the 1960s, some Americans   traveled to Mexico to obtain a "Mexican divorce".  A divorce in Mexico was easier, quicker, and less expensive than a divorce in most U.S. states.[how?] Celebrities who obtained a Mexican divorce include Johnny Carson, Katharine Hepburn, Richard Burton, Elizabeth Taylor, Marilyn Monroe, Don Hewitt, Charlie Chaplin, Jayne Mansfield, Stanley Kubrick, and Tom T. Chamales. It is also mentioned in the Jack Kerouac book On the Road. It was often referred to as a quickie (sometimes spelled quicky) Mexican divorce. Mexico does not require spouses to be present at a divorce hearing; they can send a lawyer to represent them. This "fast-track" process is in contrast to American divorce procedures, which involve additional bureaucracy and added expense. In 1970, in accordance with a Mexican federal law recommendation,[why?] many courts stopped accepting divorce petitions from non-residents. Accordingly, petitioners must be selective in their choice of court.  With the advent of no-fault divorce in the United States, Mexican divorces are not as popular as they once were.  "Mexican Divorce" is the title of a 1961 song by Burt Bacharach and Bob Hilliard, which was issued as single in 1962 by The Drifters.  The song was also covered by Ry Cooder on his 1974 album Paradise and Lunch.  Mexican divorce is also referenced in the song "What Do You Want from Life?" by The Tubes  and in the Tom Waits song "The Part You Throw Away".  A reference to a Mexican quickie divorce is also made on The Andy Griffith Show, season 4 - episode 10 "Up in Barney's Room". Mexican divorces were also plot twists in several episodes of the legal drama Perry Mason.
