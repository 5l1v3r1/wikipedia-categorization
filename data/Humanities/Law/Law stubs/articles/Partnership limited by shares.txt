A partnership limited by shares is a hybrid between a partnership and a limited liability company.  The capital and ownership of the company is divided between shareholders who have a limited liability and one or more partners who have full liability for the remainder of the company's debts.  The partner(s) will usually direct the operations of the company while the shareholders are passive investors.
