Jury sequestration is the isolation of a jury to avoid accidental or deliberate tainting.   Although sequestration is rare, publicity surrounding a trial and interested parties may interfere with juror objectivity; a judge may order that a jury be sequestered in order to prevent others from tampering with members of the jury through undue persuasion, threats, or bribes.  This occurred most notably during the O.J. Simpson trial.  The jurors are usually kept in a hotel, but they are not allowed to read the newspaper, watch television, or access the Internet.
