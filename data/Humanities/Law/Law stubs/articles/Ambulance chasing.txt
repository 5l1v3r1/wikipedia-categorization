Ambulance chasing, sometimes known as  barratry, is a professional slur which refers to a lawyer soliciting for clients at a disaster site. The term "ambulance chasing" comes from the stereotype of lawyers that follow ambulances to the emergency room to find clients.  The phrase ambulance chaser is also used more loosely as a derogatory term for a personal injury lawyer.  Ambulance chasing is prohibited in the United States. Such conduct violates Rule 7.3  of the American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct.  Some bar associations strongly enforce rules against barratry.  For example, the State Bar of California dispatches investigators to large-scale disaster scenes to discourage ambulance chasers, and to catch any who attempt to solicit business from disaster victims at the scene.  Ambulance chasing is also illegal in Australia, in accordance with clauses 20 and 22 of the Legal Profession Regulation of 1987. In the UK, Indicative Behaviour (IB) 8.5 of the Solicitors Regulation Authority Code of Conduct 2011 specifies that "approaching people in the street, at ports of entry, in hospital or at the scene of an accident" is to be taken as an indication of non-compliance with the SRA Principles.
