A bench memorandum (pl. bench memoranda) (also known as a bench memo) is a short and neutral memo which summarizes the facts, issues, and arguments of a court case. Bench memos are used by the judge as a reference when preparing for trial, when hearing lawyers' arguments, when drafting a decision, and to give the judge an idea of the arguments given by each side in the court case.  Bench memos are generally written by the judge's law clerk, although lawyers can also submit their own memos that argue their case, so long as their memos remain neutral.
