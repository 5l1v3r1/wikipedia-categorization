Like the other autonomous member churches of the Anglican Communion, the Episcopal Church in the United States has its own system of canon law. Unlike the system of canon law in the Church of England, which continues to be drawn from the canon law of the Western church, English ecclesiastical law did not remain in force in the Episcopal Church after the American Revolution.  There are two parallel systems of canon law within the church operating on a national level, governed by the General Convention, and on a diocesan level, with each diocesan convention empowered to create constitutions and canons. Diocesan constitutions do not require the approval of the General Convention. The Episcopal Church is notable among Anglican Churches for the extent to which the Constitution and Canons of the General Convention leave matters to regulation at the diocesan and parochial levels.
