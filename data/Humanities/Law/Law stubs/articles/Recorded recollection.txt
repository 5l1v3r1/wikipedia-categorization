A recorded recollection (sometimes referred to as a prior recollection recorded), in the law of evidence, is an exception to the hearsay rule which allows witnesses to testify to the accuracy of a recording or documentation of their own out-of-court statement based on their recollection of the circumstances under which the statement was recorded or documented - even though the witness does not remember the events attested to in the statement. It is sufficient that the witness is able to testify to having made the recording, and to having written an accurate statement at that time. Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, ยง 803 (5), a recorded recollection is defined as follows. The rule is followed by most U.S. states as laid out in the Federal Rules of Evidence; the evidence thus presented may be read into the record, but the actual recording or document may not be given to the jury, except under very narrow circumstances.
