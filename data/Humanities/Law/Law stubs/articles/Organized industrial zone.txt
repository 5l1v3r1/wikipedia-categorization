Organized industrial zone (Turkish: Organize Sanayi BÃ¶lgesi) is a kind of special economic zone in Turkey. These zones may bring related (OIZs for function) industries or just bring a special zone for many industries (mixed OIZs). Not every industry is allowed to be operate in organized industrial zones.  Organized industrial zones are not duty-free, but there are considerable tax and location(by making related industries closer) advantages. OIZs are related to industrial parks in some countries.
