The International Law Association (ILA) is a non-profit organization based in Great Britain that — according to its constitution — promotes "the study, clarification and development of international law" and "the furtherance of international understanding and respect for international law".   The ILA was founded in Brussels in 1873 and its present-day headquarters are in London. It holds biennial (once in 2 years) conferences and releases reports of the same for use of the international community. Members as well as outsiders are allowed to participate in the conference, at a cost. The ILA maintains several committees and study groups that analyze specific facets of international law. The findings of these groups are distributed to its members several times a year. There have been 75 conferences of ILA so far. The ILA operates through autonomous branches representing individual states or regional areas. There are currently 62 branches.
