 Courtroom View Network (CVN), the media division of Courtroom Connect, is a US company webcasting video from civil trials.     CVN is also the exclusive non-judicial provider of trials video to Westlaw.  CVN webcasts courtroom proceedings, including civil trials, hearings, and oral arguments. CVNâ€™s video has been used by the New York Times,    Wall Street Journal,   Reuters,    Bloomberg,    Associated Press,  TheStreet,  The American Lawyer,  and LawyersUSA.   Prominent trials are sometimes live-blogged using a video feed from Courtroom View Network.   CVN was founded in 2006.  Headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, CVN also has offices in New York City, NY; Washington, D.C.; and Sunnyvale, California. On October 14, 2008, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York held that CVN was entitled to webcast a federal hearing over the objection of one of the parties.  On April 16, 2009, a federal district court's order allowing CVN to webcast a hearing in a high-profile copyright infringement case   was reversed by the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit,  which blocked the webcast. On December 3, 2010, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled that Courtroom View Network was a member of the news media and a news gathering organization entitled to webcast courtroom proceedings in Massachusetts.
