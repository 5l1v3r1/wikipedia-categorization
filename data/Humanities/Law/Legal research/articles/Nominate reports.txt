Nominate reports, also known as nominative reports,   named reports and private reports,  is a legal term from common-law jurisdictions referring to the various published collections of reports of English cases in various courts from the Middle Ages to the 1860s, when law reporting was officially taken over by the Incorporated Council of Law Reporting, for example Edmund F. Moore's Reports of Cases Heard and Determined by the Judicial Committee and the Lords of His Majesty's most Honourable Privy Council on Appeal from the Supreme and Sudder Dewanny Courts in the East Indies published in London from 1837 to 1873, referred to as Moore's Indian Appeals and cited for example as: Moofti Mohummud Ubdoollah v. Baboo Mootechund 1 M.I.A. 383. Most (but not all) are reprinted in the English Reports.  They are described as "nominate" in order to distinguish them from the Year Books, which are anonymous.
