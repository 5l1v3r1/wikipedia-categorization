Exclusive federal powers are powers within a federal system of government that each constituent political unit (such as a state or province) is absolutely or conditionally prohibited from exercising.   That is, either a constituent political unit may never exercise these powers, or may only do so with the consent of the federal government. These powers are contrasted with concurrent powers, which are shared by both the federal government and each constituent political unit.
