     Constitutionalism in the United States is a basic value espoused by political parties, activist groups and individuals across a wide range of the political spectrum, that the powers of federal, state and local governments are limited by the Constitution of the United States and that the civil and political rights of citizens should not be violated.  As a political movement, many constitutionalists have expressed concern over provisions of the 2001 USA Patriot Act,  civil asset forfeiture laws,  mass surveillance,  police checkpoints  and militarization of police,   while differing over other issues, such as restrictions on firearms,   states' rights to determine drug  and restroom laws,  and federal management of public lands.
