In the case of important treaties, the Government will, of course, take an opportunity of submitting them to the House for discussion within this period. But, as the Government cannot take upon itself to decide what may be considered important or unimportant, if there is a formal demand for discussion forwarded through the usual channels from the Opposition or any other party, time will be found for the discussion of the Treaty in question.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>At the same time he stated that:\n</p>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r856303468\"/><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p>Resolutions expressing Parliamentary approval of every Treaty before ratification would be a very cumbersome form of procedure and would burden the House with a lot of unnecessary business. The absence of disapproval may be accepted as sanction, and publicity and opportunity for discussion and criticism are the really material and valuable elements which henceforth will be introduced.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>The Ponsonby Rule was withdrawn during the subsequent <a href=\"/wiki/Stanley_Baldwin\" title=\"Stanley Baldwin\">Baldwin</a> Government, but was reinstated in 1929 and gradually hardened into a practice observed by all successive Governments.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Other_countries\">Other countries</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Ponsonby_Rule&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Other countries\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The practice on legislative approval of treaties before <a href=\"/wiki/Ratification\" title=\"Ratification\">ratification</a> varies from country to country. In most countries, the constitution requires most treaties to be approved by legislature before they can formally enter into force and bind the country in question. This is particularly the case in states where international treaties become part of domestic law directly, without the need for special implementation as required in the case of the United Kingdom. \n</p><p>In countries with a strong <a href=\"/wiki/Separation_of_powers\" title=\"Separation of powers\">separation of powers</a>, this may lead to treaties being signed by the executive, but not coming into force because of legislative opposition.\n</p><p>In the <a href=\"/wiki/United_States\" title=\"United States\">United States</a>, the <a href=\"/wiki/President_of_the_United_States\" title=\"President of the United States\">president</a> must submit treaties to the <a href=\"/wiki/United_States_Senate\" title=\"United States Senate\">Senate</a> for its advice and consent to ratification, which requires a two-thirds vote. A famous example of a treaty not receiving consent is the <a href=\"/wiki/Treaty_of_Versailles\" title=\"Treaty of Versailles\">Treaty of Versailles</a>, which ended <a href=\"/wiki/World_War_I\" title=\"World War I\">World War I</a>, because of opposition to the <a href=\"/wiki/League_of_Nations\" title=\"League of Nations\">League of Nations</a>. \n</p><p>In <a href=\"/wiki/Australia\" title=\"Australia\">Australia</a>, the opposite situation exists although the practical effect does not greatly differ. The Executive (that is, the <a href=\"/wiki/Australian_Federal_Government\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Australian Federal Government\">Australian Federal Government</a>) may enter into a binding treaty without the involvement of parliament. The <a href=\"/wiki/Department_of_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade_(Australia)\" title=\"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)\">Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade</a> states \"The power to enter into treaties is an executive power within Section 61 of the Australian Constitution and accordingly, is the formal responsibility of the Executive rather than the Parliament\" <sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> and discusses the issues surrounding this fact, including the way treaties are handled in practice (which involves parliament). Implementation of treaties does require legislation by Federal parliament, following <a href=\"/wiki/Section_51(xxix)_of_the_Australian_Constitution\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Section 51(xxix) of the Australian Constitution\">Section 51(xxix) of the Australian Constitution</a>.
