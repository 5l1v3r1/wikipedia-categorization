The people determined that the federal government should be superior to the states. Under this view, the states, which are not parties to the Constitution, do not have the right to determine for themselves the proper scope of federal authority, but instead are bound by the determinations of the federal government. The state of Vermont took this position in response to the <a href=\"/wiki/Kentucky_Resolutions\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Kentucky Resolutions\">Kentucky Resolutions</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> <a href=\"/wiki/Daniel_Webster\" title=\"Daniel Webster\">Daniel Webster</a> advocated this view in his <a href=\"/wiki/Webster-Hayne_debate\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Webster-Hayne debate\">debate with Robert Hayne</a> in the Senate in 1830:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>[I]t cannot be shown, that the Constitution is a compact between State governments. The Constitution itself, in its very front, refutes that idea; it, declares that it is ordained and established <i>by the people of the United States</i>. So far from saying that it is established by the governments <i>of the several States</i>, it does not even say that it is established by the people of the several States; but it pronounces that it is established by the people of the United States, in the aggregate. . . . When the gentleman says the Constitution is a compact between the States, he uses language exactly applicable to the old Confederation. He speaks as if he were in Congress before 1789. He describes fully that old state of things then existing. The Confederation was, in strictness, a compact; the States, as States, were parties to it. We had no other general government. But that was found insufficient, and inadequate to the public exigencies. The people were not satisfied with it, and undertook to establish a better. They undertook to form a general government, which should stand on a new basis; not a confederacy, not a league, not a compact between States, but a <i>Constitution</i>; a popular government, founded in popular election, directly responsible to the people themselves, and divided into branches with prescribed limits of power, and prescribed duties. They ordained such a government, they gave it the name of a <i>Constitution</i>, therein they established a distribution of powers between this, their general government, and their several State governments.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup></p></blockquote>\n<p>The leading nineteenth century commentary on the Constitution, Justice <a href=\"/wiki/Joseph_Story\" title=\"Joseph Story\">Joseph Story</a>'s <i>Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States</i> (1833), likewise rejected the compact theory, concluding that the Constitution was established directly by the people, not by the states, and that it constitutes supreme law, not a mere compact.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In the years before the Civil War, the compact theory was used by southern states to argue that they had a right to nullify federal law and to secede from the union. For example, during the <a href=\"/wiki/Nullification_Crisis\" title=\"Nullification Crisis\">Nullification Crisis</a> of 1828-1832, <a href=\"/wiki/John_C._Calhoun\" title=\"John C. Calhoun\">John C. Calhoun</a> argued in his <a href=\"/wiki/South_Carolina_Exposition_and_Protest\" title=\"South Carolina Exposition and Protest\">South Carolina Exposition and Protest</a> that the states, as the parties to a compact, had the right to judge for themselves whether the terms of the compact were being honored. Calhoun described this \"right of judging\" as \"an essential attribute of sovereignty,\" which the states retained when the Constitution was formed. Calhoun said the states had the right to nullify, or veto, any laws that were inconsistent with the compact.<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>When the southern states seceded in 1860-61, they relied on the compact theory to justify secession. The southern states argued that the northern states had violated the compact by undermining and attacking the institution of slavery and the slaveholders' property rights in their slaves. The southern states stated that they therefore were justified in withdrawing from the compact among the states.<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The United States Supreme Court has rejected the idea that the Constitution is a compact among the states.

Georgia\">Chisholm v. Georgia</a></i> (1793), Chief Justice John Jay stated that the Constitution was established directly by the people. Jay noted the language of the Preamble of the Constitution, which says that the Constitution was ordained and established by \"We the people,\" and stated: \"Here we see the people acting as sovereigns of the whole country, and, in the language of sovereignty, establishing a Constitution by which it was their will that the State governments should be bound.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In <i><a href=\"/wiki/Martin_v._Hunter%27s_Lessee\" title=\"Martin v. Hunter&#39;s Lessee\">Martin v. Hunter's Lessee</a></i> (1816), the Supreme Court explicitly rejected the idea that the Constitution is a compact among the states, stating: \"The Constitution of the United States was ordained and established not by the States in their sovereign capacities, but emphatically, as the preamble of the Constitution declares, by 'the people of the United States.'\" The Court contrasted the earlier Articles of Confederation with the Constitution, characterizing the Articles of Confederation as a compact among states, while stating that the Constitution was established not by the states, but by the people.<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Likewise, in <i><a href=\"/wiki/McCulloch_v._Maryland\" title=\"McCulloch v. Maryland\">McCulloch v. Maryland</a></i> (1819), the Supreme Court stated that the federal Constitution proceeded directly from the people, and was not created by the states. The Court stated that the Constitution was binding on the states and could not be negated by the states. The Court again contrasted the Articles of Confederation, which was established by the states, to the Constitution, which was established by the people.<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>After the Civil War, in <i><a href=\"/wiki/Texas_v._White\" title=\"Texas v.

It required not the affirmance, and could not be negatived, by the State Governments. The Constitution, when thus adopted, was of complete obligation, and bound the State sovereignties. . . . To the formation of a league such as was the Confederation, the State sovereignties were certainly competent. But when, 'in order to form a more perfect union,' it was deemed necessary to change this alliance into an effective Government, possessing great and sovereign powers and acting directly on the people, the necessity of referring it to the people, and of deriving its powers directly from them, was felt and acknowledged by all. The Government of the Union then (whatever may be the influence of this fact on the case) is, emphatically and truly, a Government of the people. In form and in substance, it emanates from them. Its powers are granted by them, and are to be exercised directly on them, and for their benefit.\" <i><a href=\"/wiki/McCulloch_v._Maryland\" title=\"McCulloch v. Maryland\">McCulloch v.

All the obligations of perpetual union, and all the guaranties of republican government in the Union, attached at once to the State. The act which consummated her admission into the Union was something more than a compact; it was the incorporation of a new member into the political body. And it was final. The union between Texas and the other States was as complete, as perpetual, and as indissoluble as the union between the original States.\" <i><a href=\"/wiki/Texas_v._White\" title=\"Texas v.
