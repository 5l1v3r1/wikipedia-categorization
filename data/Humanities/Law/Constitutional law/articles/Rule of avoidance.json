Terms of service were for only three or four years, and parents and sons over fifteen could not accompany officials. Each prefecture sent delegates to an annual court assembly.

Government officials were not allowed to serve in one jurisdiction for long so that they did not become too involved in local affairs and become stronger than the Emperor himself. After a period of time, employees of the Emperor were transferred and jurisdiction of service was thus rotated regularly. The implementation of this system in the Empire by Akbar helped in preventing corruption and favoritism. This method was discarded and forgotten by the later Emperors.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"United_States_law\">United States law</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Rule_of_avoidance&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: United States law\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The rule of avoidance employed by the <a href=\"/wiki/United_States_Supreme_Court\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"United States Supreme Court\">United States Supreme Court</a> is a principle, settled in <i>Ashwander v.
