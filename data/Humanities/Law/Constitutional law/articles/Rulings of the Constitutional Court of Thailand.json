financial crisis</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Klein_1-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Klein-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>  The government had issued the decrees in early May 1998 to expand the role

Institutions Development Fund</a> through the issue of 500 billion THB in <a href=\"/wiki/Bond_(finance)\" title=\"Bond (finance)\">bonds</a>, and to authorize the Ministry of Finance to seek 200 billion THB in overseas loans. The opposition <a href=\"/wiki/New_Aspiration_Party\" title=\"New Aspiration Party\">New Aspiration Party</a> (NAP) did not have the votes to defeat the bills, and therefore, on the last day of debate, invoked Article 219 of the Constitution to question the constitutionality of an emergency decree.\n</p><p>The NAP argued that since there was no emergency nor necessary urgency (under Article 218(2)), the government could not issue any emergency decrees. Article 219, however, specifically notes the constitutionality of an emergency decree can be questioned only on Article 218(1) concerning the maintenance of national or public safety, national economic security, or to avert public calamity. The government, fearing further economic damage if the decree were delayed, opposed the Court's acceptance of the complaint, as the opposition clearly had failed to cite the proper constitutional\nclause.  The Court wished to set a precedent, however, demonstrating it would accept petitions\nunder Article 219, even if technically inaccurate. Within a day it ruled that it was\nobvious to the general public that the nation was in an economic crisis, and that the decrees were\ndesigned to assist with national economic security in accordance with Article 218(1). The decrees were later quickly approved by Parliament.\n</p><p>The NAP's last minute motion damaged its credibility, and made it unlikely that Article 219 will\nbe invoked unless there is a credible issue and the issue is raised and discussed at the beginning\nof Parliamentary debate, rather than at the last-minute before a vote.\n</p><p>On the other hand, a precedent was established by the Court that it would accept all petitions under Article 219 to preserve Parliament's right to question the constitutionality of emergency executive decrees.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Thaksin_Shinawatra_and_the_allegation_of_hiding_assets_and_stocks\">Thaksin Shinawatra and the allegation of hiding assets and stocks</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Rulings_of_the_Constitutional_Court_of_Thailand&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Thaksin Shinawatra and the allegation of hiding assets and stocks\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>After the sounding victory of <a href=\"/wiki/Thaksin_Shinawatra\" title=\"Thaksin Shinawatra\">Thaksin Shinawatra</a>'s party, <a href=\"/wiki/Thai_Rak_Thai\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Thai Rak Thai\">Thai Rak Thai</a>, in 2001 election, the Anti-Corruption Committee filed a case charging him as hiding a handful of assets in form of stocks, which is unlawful due to the 1997 Constitution.

The Court ruled the IMF letters were not treaties, as internationally defined, because they were unilateral documents from the Thai government with no rules for enforcement or provisions for penalty.

Jaruvan was one of three nominees for the position of auditor-general in 2001, along with Prathan Dabpet and Nontaphon Nimsomboon. Prathan received 5 votes from the 8-person State Audit Commission (SAC) chairman while Jaruvan received 3 votes. According to the constitution, State Audit Commission chairman Panya Tantiyavarong should have submitted Prathan's nomination to the Senate, as he received the majority of votes.  However, on July 3, 2001, the SAC Chairman submitted a list of all three candidates for the post of auditor-general to the Senate, which later voted to select Khunying Jaruvan Maintaka.\n</p><p>The Constitutional Court ruled on 6 July 2004 that the selection process that led to the appointment of Jaruvan as Auditor-General was unconstitutional. The Court noted that the Constitution empowers the SAC to nominate only one person with the highest number of votes from a simple majority, not three as had been the case. The court stopped short of saying if she had to leave her post.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>  However, when the Constitutional Court had ruled on 4 July 2002 that the then <a href=\"/wiki/Election_Commission_(Thailand)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Election Commission (Thailand)\">Election Commission</a> chairman <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Sirin_Thoopklam&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Sirin Thoopklam (page does not exist)\">Sirin Thoopklam's</a> election to the body was unconstitutional, the President of the Court noted \"When the court rules that the selection [process] was unconstitutional and has to be redone, the court requires the incumbent to leave the post\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>However, Jaruwan refused to resign without a royal dismissal from King Bhumibol Adulyadej.

The Senate approved the nomination on 10 May 2005. However, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, in an unprecedented move, withheld his royal assent. The National Assembly did not hold a vote to overthrow the royal veto. In October 2005 the Senate rejected a motion to reaffirm her appointment, and instead deferred the decision to the SAC.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>On 15 February 2006 The State Audit Commission (SAC) decided to reinstate Auditor-General Khunying Jaruvan Maintaka.
