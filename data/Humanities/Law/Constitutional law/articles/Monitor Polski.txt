Monitor Polski (English: Official Gazette of the Republic of Poland, abbreviated M. P. or MP) is a publication of the Prime Minister of the Republic of Poland. It publishes legal acts in Polish law that are not a source of new laws, and various public decisions that are required to be made public. Unlike Dziennik Ustaw, acts published in Monitor are not a source of laws or obligations on the part of Polish citizens. There is also 'Monitor Polski B' which publishes financial statements of the Republic of Poland.
