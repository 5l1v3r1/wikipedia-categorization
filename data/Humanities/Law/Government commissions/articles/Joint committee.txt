A joint committee is a committee made up of members of both chambers of a bicameral legislature. In other contexts, it refers to a committee with members from more than one organization. A joint committee (Gemeinsamer Ausschuss) comprises members of both Bundestag (two thirds) and Bundesrat (one third). It exists to ensure a working legislature during a state of defense. A Joint Committee of the Irish Oireachtas (parliament) comprises members of both Dáil Éireann (the lower house) and Seanad Éireann (the upper house). A bicameral conference committee is formed for each bill where the Senate and the House of Representatives have conflicting versions. The committee has the same number of members from each chamber. Once passed, the chambers then have to approve the version passed by the bicameral conference committee in order for it to be sent for the president's signature. If Congress is short on time, a chamber may approve the other chamber's version instead. A joint committee of the Parliament of the United Kingdom is a select committee consisting of members of both the House of Commons and the House of Lords. In the UK the term "joint committee" can also refer to a committee of local authorities established under the provisions of  Local Government Act 1972. A joint committee of the United States Congress is a congressional committee consisting of both Senate and House members and having jurisdiction over matters of joint interest. An example of a joint committee is the Joint Committee on the Library. Most joint committees are permanent (as with the Library Committee) but temporary joint committees have been created to address specific issues (such as the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War during the American Civil War). As of June 17, 2017, there were[update] four joint committees: the Economic, Library, Printing, and Taxation committees.  In addition to the joint committees, Congress also has standing and select/special committees.
