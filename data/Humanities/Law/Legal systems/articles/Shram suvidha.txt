Shram Suvidha is a Web Portal to provide a single platform for all labour compliances. India has more than 40 labour laws regulated by the Ministry of Labour and Employment, the Government of India and State Government. Compliance with these laws is tedious and time-consuming. As a result, employers often do not comply. The scale of noncompliance exceeds the ability of enforcement agencies to regulate. Amidst the confusion, employees do not always receive what they are entitled to under these laws.  The primary objectives of Shram Suvidha are: Shram Suvidha allows an organization to know what labour laws apply to it.   Compliances are reportable in a single form that makes it simple for those filing such forms. Performance is monitored using key indicators thus making the evaluation process objective. It promotes the use of a common Labour Identification Number (LIN) by all Implementing agencies.
