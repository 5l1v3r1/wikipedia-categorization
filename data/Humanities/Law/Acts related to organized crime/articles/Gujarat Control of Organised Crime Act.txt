  The Gujarat Control of Organised Crime Act (GUJCOCA) is a controversial anti-terrorism legislation passed by the state legislature of Gujarat, India, in April 2003. It is awaiting Presidential approval. The bill was drawn on the lines of the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (for Maharashtra) and Karnataka Control of Organised Crime Act (for Karnataka).  It was then sent to the office of the President of India for assent.  The bill was returned to the state legislature suggesting certain  amendments.  In June 2004,  it was passed again by the state legislature after deleting the provisions relating to interception of communication as suggested by the then President, Dr. A P J Kalam and sent back for approval. The bill was sent back to the state in December 2008 with suggestions of further amendments, but the President's office recalled the file back shortly in January 2009 saying it wanted to have another look.  In June 2009  the bill was returned to the state with recommendations to make following amendments to 3 clauses. In July 2009,  the bill was re-introduced in the state legislature without the changes suggested by the President and passed.
