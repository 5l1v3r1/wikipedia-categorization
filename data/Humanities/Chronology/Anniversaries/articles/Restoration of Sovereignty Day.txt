The Restoration of Sovereignty Day (主権回復の日, Shuken kaifuku no hi) is a new public commemorative event on 28 April, proposed by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe in 2012 and first formally celebrated in 2013. It marks the end of the American occupation of Japan on 28 April 1952. It has been described as "part of Mr Abe's nationalist campaign" by the BBC.  The event was held at Kensei Kinenkan Hall in Chiyoda ward, Tokyo. It was attended by Emperor Akihito, Empress Michiko and around three hundred guests. There were large public demonstrations by Okinawans who regarded it as a "day of disgrace" on which they were "sold off to the U.S. military"  for twenty years. The Governor of Okinawa, Hirokazu Nakaima, did not attend, but sent his deputy, Kurayoshi Takara.
