Private schools may have a slightly shorter academic calendar either starting in the second (or third week) of June or ending earlier in March.\n</p><p>In most primary and secondary (junior high) schools, an academic year is usually divided into quarters for purposes of examination and reporting of marks though a few private schools adopt a trimestral system. Each quarter normally lasts for approximately seven (usually the 3rd quarter) to ten weeks (usually the 1st, 2nd and 4th quarters) but the actual length of each quarter and the months they cover varies among private schools.  The fourth quarter for pupils in grade 6 is usually two to three weeks shorter than undergraduates to allow for preparation of final grades to determine who are eligible for graduation as well as to prepare for the graduation ceremonies themselves.  Each quarter culminates in most schools with a quarterly examination period of three to five days.\n</p>\n<table class=\"wikitable\">\n\n<tbody><tr>\n<th>Quarter</th>\n<th>Usual Months covered (including exam periods)</th>\n<th>Breaks after the exam\n</th></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1st</td>\n<td>June - mid-August</td>\n<td>none\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2nd</td>\n<td>mid-August - late-October</td>\n<td>Semestral break: approximately one week\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>November - 3rd week of December</td>\n<td>Christmas break: approximately two weeks\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4th</td>\n<td>January - mid-late March</td>\n<td>Summer break: approximately eight to nine weeks and it separates one school year from another.\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>The academic term for senior high school (grades 11 and 12) operates on a semestral basis.  Semestral, Christmas, and summer breaks are scheduled at about the same time as primary and junior high school.  Grade 12 pupils have a shorter second semester than grade 11 in order for the school to prepare for graduation.\n</p><p>In most schools, summer break usually lasts for two months, starting from the first week of April up to the last week of May. Most schools end the school year before <a href=\"/wiki/Holy_Week_in_the_Philippines\" title=\"Holy Week in the Philippines\">Holy Week</a>.

The student will need to successfully complete clearance requirements and in a few cases, maintain a certain overall mark in order to progress in her university studies in the next semester.  The first semester is followed by a break consisting of two to four weeks before the second semester, called the Semestral Break, which usually occurs between the second week of October to the second week of November for all universities and colleges.

Quarters are typically 10\u201312 weeks long so that three quarters amount to 30\u201336 weeks of instruction. Approximately 20 per cent of universities are on the quarter system. Most colleges that use the quarter system have a fall quarter from late September to mid-December, a winter quarter from early January to mid-March, a spring quarter from late March or early April to mid-June, and an optional summer session. Notable users of the quarter system include the <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_California\" title=\"University of California\">University of California</a> system (excluding <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley\" title=\"University of California, Berkeley\">Berkeley</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_California,_Merced\" title=\"University of California, Merced\">Merced</a>, the <a href=\"/wiki/David_Geffen_School_of_Medicine_at_UCLA\" title=\"David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA\">UCLA medical school</a>, and all of the system's law schools), <a href=\"/wiki/Stanford_University\" title=\"Stanford University\">Stanford</a>, the <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_Chicago\" title=\"University of Chicago\">University of Chicago</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Dartmouth_College\" title=\"Dartmouth College\">Dartmouth College</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Northwestern_University\" title=\"Northwestern University\">Northwestern University</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_Washington\" title=\"University of Washington\">University of Washington</a>, the <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_Oregon\" title=\"University of Oregon\">University of Oregon</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/DePaul_University\" title=\"DePaul University\">DePaul University</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-50\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-50\">&#91;50&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-51\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-51\">&#91;51&#93;</a></sup>  <a href=\"/wiki/Union_College\" title=\"Union College\">Union College</a> uses a modified quarter system: fall, winter, and spring terms are each eleven weeks long; there are some summer classes, but there is no official summer quarter.<sup id=\"cite_ref-52\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-52\">&#91;52&#93;</a></sup> Because Union's calendar makes use of just three of four quarters, the three academic terms are generally (and somewhat misleadingly to outsiders) dubbed \"trimesters,\" which they literally are since they each span three months, December, July and August being off.<sup id=\"cite_ref-53\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-53\">&#91;53&#93;</a></sup> Another notable and somewhat unique user of the quarter system is <a href=\"/wiki/Baylor_Law_School\" title=\"Baylor Law School\">Baylor Law School</a>: it operates on the quarter system while the remaining colleges of <a href=\"/wiki/Baylor_University\" title=\"Baylor University\">Baylor University</a> operate on the semester system.\n</p><p>The semester system divides the calendar year into two semesters of 16 to 18 weeks each, plus summer sessions of varying lengths.  The two semesters together constitute 32 to 36 weeks of instruction, so that three academic quarters equal two academic semesters. Thus, academic credit earned in quarter hours converts to semester hours at \u2154 of its value, while credit earned in semester hours converts to quarter hours at 3/2 of its value. Put another way, 3 quarter hours is 2 semester hours.

It divides the academic year into three equal portions of 15 \u2013 16 weeks each. Institutions that use the trimester system include <a href=\"/wiki/Carleton_College\" title=\"Carleton College\">Carleton College</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Knox_College_(Illinois)\" title=\"Knox College (Illinois)\">Knox College (Illinois)</a>,  <a href=\"/wiki/Lawrence_University\" title=\"Lawrence University\">Lawrence University</a>, and the <a href=\"/wiki/United_States_Merchant_Marine_Academy\" title=\"United States Merchant Marine Academy\">United States Merchant Marine Academy</a>. The fall and winter trimesters constitute an academic year of 30\u201332 weeks.  The spring/summer trimester is usually divided into a 7.5 week Spring Session followed by a 6-week or 7.5 week Summer Session.<sup id=\"cite_ref-56\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-56\">&#91;56&#93;</a></sup> The reduced maximum course load that accompanies the shortening from the traditional semester makes the trimester system compatible with the semester system. Academic credit is thus measured on the trimester system in semester hours; there is no such thing as a \"trimester hour\" of credit.\n</p><p>At the <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_Michigan\" title=\"University of Michigan\">University of Michigan</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Brigham_Young_University\" title=\"Brigham Young University\">Brigham Young University</a>, for example, the Fall trimester (informally still called 'semester') operates from September through December; the Winter trimester runs from January through April; and the spring-summer trimester operates from May through August, as two half-trimesters. Most spring-summer classes either meet double-time for 7\u20138 weeks in May and June or double-time/double-plus-time for 6\u20138 weeks in July and August (with summer half-term classes sometimes starting in the last week of June).\n</p><p>The quinmester academic calendar at <a href=\"/wiki/Park_University\" title=\"Park University\">Park University</a> operates with five terms per year, each lasting eight weeks (January\u2013March, March\u2013May, June\u2013July, August\u2013October, and October\u2013December).<sup id=\"cite_ref-57\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-57\">&#91;57&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>A number of colleges have adopted the \"one course at a time\" or \"block schedule\" calendar.
