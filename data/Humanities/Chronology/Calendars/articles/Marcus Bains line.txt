The Marcus Bains line is a line that shows the current time in many calendar applications and PIM suites. Usually, it is a red horizontal line showing at the location of the current time in the "day" or "week" views of a calendar, sometimes complemented with the current time. From at least September 2000 on, there has been a patch for ical to show the Marcus Bains line.  Gradually other programs such as Korganizer, Evolution and Google Calendar started supporting the line, either through patches, third-party scripts or natively. Many commercial programs implementing it kept the red colour or the name.
