 The June solstice, also known as the northern solstice, is the solstice on the Earth that occurs each June falling on the 20th to 22nd according to the Gregorian calendar. In the Northern Hemisphere, the June solstice is the summer solstice, whilst in the Southern Hemisphere it is the winter solstice. The June solstice solar year is the solar year based on the June solstice. It is thus the length of time between adjacent June solstices. In 6000 BC, the December solstice solar year had a length of 50:35 in excess of 365 days and 5 hours. This shortened to 47:55 in 2000 AD. It will remain between 47:45 and 48:00 at least until 10000 AD.  The following tables contain information on the length of the day on the summer solstice of the northern hemisphere and winter solstice of the southern hemisphere (i.e. June solstice). The data was collected from the website of the Finnish Meteorological Institute on 20 June 2016  as well as from certain other websites.         The data is arranged geographically and within the tables from the longest day to the shortest one.
