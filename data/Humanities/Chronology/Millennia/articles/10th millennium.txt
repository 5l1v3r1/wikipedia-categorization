The tenth millennium of the Gregorian calendar will begin on January 1, 9001, and end on December 31, 10000. All these dates are in a uniform time scale such as Terrestrial Time. When converted to our ordinary solar time or Universal Time, which is decidedly non-uniform, via Î”T, the dates would be a couple of days earlier. Furthermore, they are only astronomical dates, so they are given in the astronomical format of Year Month Day, which allows them to be ordered. Software that encodes the CE / AD calendar year of a date as a four-character binary-coded decimal will no longer be able to encode the contemporaneous date. This problem will possibly occur from midnight on January 1, 10000.
