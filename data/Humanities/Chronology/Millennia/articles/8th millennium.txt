The eighth millennium of the Gregorian calendar will begin on January 1, 7001, and end on December 31, 8000.  All these dates are in a uniform time scale such as Terrestrial Time. When converted to our ordinary solar time or Universal Time, which is decidedly non-uniform, via Î”T, the dates would be about one day earlier.
