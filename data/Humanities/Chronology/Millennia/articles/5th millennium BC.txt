It saw the spread of agriculture from Western Asia throughout Southern and Central Europe. Urban cultures in Mesopotamia and Anatolia flourished, developing the wheel. Copper ornaments became more common, marking the beginning of the Chalcolithic. Animal husbandry spread throughout Eurasia, reaching China.  World population growth relaxes after the burst due to the Neolithic Revolution.  World population is largely stable, at roughly 40 million, with a slow overall growth rate at roughly 0.03% p.a.  In North-Eastern Europe a "ceramic Mesolithic" can be distinguished,  found peripheral to the sedentary Neolithic cultures. It created a distinctive type of pottery, with point or knob base and flared rims, manufactured by methods not used by the Neolithic farmers.  The earliest manifestation of this type of pottery may be in the region around Lake Baikal in Siberia, from as early as 7000 BC,  and from there spread via the Dnieper-Donets culture to the Narva culture of the Eastern Baltic. Spreading westward along the coastline it is found in the Ertebølle culture of Denmark and Ellerbek of Northern Germany, and the related Swifterbant culture of the Low Countries.   Prior to the 5.9 kiloyear event (3900 BC) and the desiccation of the Green Sahara, Sub-Saharan Africa remains in the Paleolithic. The beginning of the  Pastoral Neolithic falls still into the late phase of the Green Sahara, in the 6th or 5th millennium BC.  As the grasslands of the Sahara began drying after 3900 BC, herders would spread into the Nile Valley and by the mid 3rd millennium BC into eastern Africa.
