This is a chronological summary of the major events of the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The first matches in the group stages of the Football events were played on Wednesday 3 August. The opening ceremony took place on Friday 5 August. The last day of competition and the closing ceremony was on Sunday 21 August. With 306 sets of medals, the games featured 28 Olympic sports, including rugby sevens and golf, which were added to the Olympic program in 2009. These sporting events took place at 33 venues in the host city, and at five in São Paulo, Belo Horizonte, Salvador, Brasília, and Manaus. Due to the European migrant crisis and other reasons, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) allowed athletes to compete under the Olympic Flag as part of the "Refugee Olympic Team" (ROT); out of 43 refugee athletes deemed potentially eligible, 10 were chosen to form this team.  Due to the suspension of the National Olympic Committee of Kuwait, participants from Kuwait were allowed to participate under the Olympic Flag as "Independent Olympic Athletes" (IOA).  This is currently based on the schedule released on the same day as ticket sales began, 31 March 2015.    *   Host nation (Brazil)    *   Host nation (Brazil)
