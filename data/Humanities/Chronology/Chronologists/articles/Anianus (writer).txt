Anianus  was an Egyptian monk who lived at the beginning of the 5th century AD and wrote a chronography in which, according to the later chronicler George Syncellus, he generally followed Eusebius, but sometimes corrected errors made by that writer. It is, however, very doubtful whether Anianus, on the whole, surpassed Eusebius in accuracy. Syncellus frequently finds fault with him.   This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Smith, Philip (1870). "Anianus".  In Smith, William.
