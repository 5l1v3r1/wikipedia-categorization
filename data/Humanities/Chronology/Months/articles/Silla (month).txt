Sillā (Nepal Bhasa: सिल्ला) is the fourth month in the Nepal Era calendar, the national lunar calendar of Nepal.  The month corresponds to Magha (माघ) in the Hindu lunar calendar and February in the Gregorian calendar. Sillā begins with the new moon and the full moon falls on the 15th of the lunar month. The month is divided into the bright and dark fortnights which are known as Sillā Thwa (सिल्ला थ्व) and Sillā Gā (सिल्ला गा) respectively. The most important festivals during the month are Shree Panchami which falls on the fifth day of the bright fortnight and Maha Shivaratri (Nepal Bhasa: सिला चह्रे Silā Charhe) on the 14th day of the dark fortnight. Shree Panchami is the first day of spring while Shivaratri honors the Hindu deity Shiva. On the full moon day, the month-long Swasthani sacred story reciting festival ends.
