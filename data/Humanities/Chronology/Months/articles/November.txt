November is the eleventh and penultimate month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian Calendars, the fourth and last of four months to have a length of 30 days, and the fifth and last of five months to have a length of less than 31 days. November was the ninth month of the ancient Roman calendar. November retained its name (from the Latin novem meaning "nine") when January and February were added to the Roman calendar. November is a month of late spring in the Southern Hemisphere and late autumn in the Northern Hemisphere. Therefore, November in the Southern Hemisphere is the seasonal equivalent of May in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa. In Ancient Rome, Ludi Plebeii was held from November 4–17, Epulum Jovis was held on November 13, and Brumalia celebrations began on November 24. These dates do not correspond to the modern Gregorian calendar. November was referred to as Blōtmōnaþ by the Anglo-Saxons. Brumaire and Frimaire were the months on which November fell in the French Republican Calendar. November meteor showers include the Andromedids; which occurs from September 25 to December 6 and generally peak around November 9–14, the Leonids; which occur  from November 15–20, the Alpha Monocerotids; which occur from November 15–25 with the peak on November 21–22, the Northern Taurids; which occur from October 20 to December 10, and the Southern Taurids which occur from September 10 – November 20, and the Phoenicids; which occur from November 29 to December 9 with the peak occurring on December 5–6. The Orionids, which occur in late October, sometimes last into November. The Western zodiac signs for the month of November are Scorpio (October 24 – November 22) and  Sagittarius (November 23 – December 21).
