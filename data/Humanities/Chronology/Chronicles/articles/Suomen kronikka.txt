Suomen kronikka (lat. Chronicon Finlandiae, eng. The Chronicle of Finland) is a chronicle written in 1670s describing the history of Finland until middle ages. The writer is unknown, but the most likely candidate is painter Elias Brenner. He was known patron of Finns and Finland and his stages of life support the possibility. If Brenner is the author of the chronicle, it has been written between 1672-1674. The original chronicle was published in Latin in 1728 by Christian Nettelblad.  The chronicle was aimed at creating a great past to Finns who were still under Swedish rule. This is possibly the reason that it was only printed after the death of the author and the fall of the Swedish empire.  The author mainly uses sagas and historians as sources of the chronicle, such as Saxo Grammaticus, Bartholomeus Anglicus, Johannes Magnus, Olaus Magnus, Anders Bure, Michael Wexionius and Snorri Sturluson.
