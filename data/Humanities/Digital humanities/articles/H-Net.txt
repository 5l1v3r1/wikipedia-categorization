H-Net ("Humanities & Social Sciences Online") is an interdisciplinary forum for scholars in the humanities and social sciences. It is best known for hosting electronic mailing lists organized by academic disciplines; according to the organization's website, H-Net lists reach over 100,000 subscribers in more than 90 countries.  The H-Net Network has grown until it is now endorsed by many academic professional organizations.  Its over 180 topic- or discipline-specific lists are often the primary internet forum for scholars.   Individual lists are "edited by a team of scholars";  each has a board of editors. In addition to its email lists, H-Net provides three related online services: H-Net is hosted by the Department of History at Michigan State University.  Many of the lists deal with various areas of historical study. Within two years of its founding, H-Net was recognized as being "among the most dynamic and effective contributions" to the internationalization of scholarship.  H-Net began in 1992 as an initiative of Prof. Richard J. Jensen of the History department at the University of Illinois at Chicago, to assist historians "to easily communicate current research and teaching interests; to discuss new approaches, methods and tools of analysis; to share information on access to library catalogs and other electronic databases; and to test new ideas and share comments on current historiography."  H-Net is now organized as an international consortium of scholars in the humanities and social sciences and its networks are hosted by Michigan State University. In 2010, the H-Net president is historian Jean A. Stuntz of West Texas A&M University.
