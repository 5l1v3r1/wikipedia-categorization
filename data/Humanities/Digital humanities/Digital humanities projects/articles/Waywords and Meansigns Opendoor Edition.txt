The Waywords and Meansigns Opendoor Edition debuted in 2017 as a part of the Waywords and Meansigns project setting James Joyce's Finnegans Wake to music. The Opendoor Edition features over 100 artists and musicians performing unabridged passages of Finnegans Wake.  An open edition, participants are invited to contribute to the Opendoor Edition on an ongoing basis.  The edition first premiered May 4, 2017.  The genres represented in the Waywords and Meansigns Opendoor Edition are quite diverse, ranging from metal and industrial to folk and jazz.  Many of the tracks are experimental; some recordings adhere to fairly traditional song formats while others offer audiobook-like readings with ambient accompaniment.  The Waywords and Meansigns project began in 2014 with a goal of setting James Joyce's Finnegans Wake to music unabridged. They released two unabridged editions of the text, in 2015 and 2016.  Over 300 people have been involved in Wayords and Meansigns since 2014.   The Waywords and Meansigns Opendoor Edition features contributors from 15 different countries in what was called "an all-star cast of weirdos."  The music is often experimental; the musicians' only requirements were that "the words be audible, unabridged and more or less in their original order."  All audio from the project is distributed freely online under Creative Commons licensing. Contributors to Waywords and Meansigns are a self-described collection of "musicians, artists, poets, scholars, weirdos, passionate Wake-heads, those totally ignorant of the Wake, and anyone generally adventurous."  Artists participating in the Opendoor Edition include: Krzysztof Bartnicki; Martyn Bates; John Wolf Brennan; Neil Campbell; Tim Carbone of Railroad Earth and Lou Rogai of Lewis & Clarke; Joe Cassidy of Butterfly Child; Hayden Chisholm; S.A. Griffin; Kinski; Ulrich Krieger; Jason Sebastian Russo; David Moss; Monica Queen; Schneider TM; Sally Timms; Mike Watt; and many more.  The Guardian has highlighted the project for making Joyce's famously difficult novel more accessible.  Finn Fordham, a James Joyce scholar at Royal Holloway, University of London has called the project "wonderfully innovative."  Tracks are organized by page and line number, followed by the artist name, and then occasionally followed by the track’s nickname.

Open Culture's Josh Jones deemed the Opendoor Edition "one of the most appropriate responses to the novel in the 78 years since its publication."  Other writers did not review the music itself but focused primarily on the project's ambitious and unusual nature.    Maria Schurr, in her PopMatters review,  wrote: "the well of inspiration springing from Joyce's words is thrillingly infinite."  Paste's Jay Horton wrote of the third edition: "It’s soon enough made clear that there are as many varieties of musical renderings as there are interpretations of its prose, which sparks the likely-unavoidable problem concerning the songs and the book they’re taken from and the ideas it (barely) contains – there’s just too damn many."  Culture.pl described listeners as "wallowing in the infinite possible meanings that Finnegans Wake inspires."
