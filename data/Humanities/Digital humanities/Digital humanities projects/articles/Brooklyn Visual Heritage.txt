Brooklyn Visual Heritage is an online digital history website resource produced by Project CHART, presenting historical 19th and 20th century photographs of Brooklyn, New York City, held by several cultural institutions.   Project CHART was a collaboration between the Pratt Institute (School of Information and Library Science), Brooklyn Historical Society,  Brooklyn Public Library,  and Brooklyn Museum.  The three-year project was funded by the US Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) and the Laura Bush 21st Century Librarian Program.  The website was launched publicly in 2013.
