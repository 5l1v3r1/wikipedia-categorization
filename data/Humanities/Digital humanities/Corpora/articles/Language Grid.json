It takes the <a href=\"/wiki/Service-orientation\" title=\"Service-orientation\">service-oriented approach</a> by wrapping existing language resources as atomic <a href=\"/wiki/Web_services\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Web services\">Web services</a> and enables users to compose new services by combining atomic <a href=\"/wiki/Web_services\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Web services\">Web services</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Architecture\">Architecture</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Language_Grid&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Architecture\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The architecture of the Language Grid is to increase the usability of language resources, and to decrease the risk to providers in opening their resources. By wrapping resources as services, providers can control their intellectual property rights. It is essential to define stakeholders, their roles and the social protocol among them. Every stakeholder related to service grids, a <i>service grid user</i>, can take one or more roles in the following three categories.\n</p>\n<ul><li><i>Service provider</i> wraps language resources into language services, and deploys them on a grid. When registering services, access control policies can be specified for each service.</li>\n<li><i>Service consumer</i> invokes registered language services from an application system. When invoking a composite language service, the request is sent to a workflow engine, which executes a workflow that combines one or more atomic language services.</li>\n<li><i>Grid operator</i> manages and controls a service grid for service providers and consumers. Each service grid has a grid operator.</li></ul>\n<p>The institutional agreement reflects the intentions of the three roles of service grid users. From service providers\u2019 point of view, protection of intellectual property rights is critical. To satisfy such demands, service usage is classified into the following three categories:\n</p>\n<ul><li><i>Non-profit use</i>: services are used in public or non-profit settings.</li>\n<li><i>Research use</i>: services intended to advance the field, not for commercial profit.</li>\n<li><i>For-profit use</i>: services for commercial profit regardless of the type of organization.</li></ul>\n<p>Even in for-profit organizations, social responsibility activities are classified as non-profit use. This is because such activities are often conducted with public institutions or non-profit organizations. Conversely, the activities of public institutions or non-profit organizations for commercial profit are classified as for-profit use.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Software\">Software</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Language_Grid&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Software\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The Language Grid consists of four service layers: P2P Service Grid Layer, Atomic Service Layer, Composite Service Layer and Application System Layer.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> The P2P Service Grid Layer is constructed by the Service Grid Server Software. \n</p><p>The main components are Service Supervisor and Grid Composer.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> The Service Supervisor controls service invocations according to the access control policies registered by service providers.

Later, Language Grid Jakarta Operation Center in Indonesia and Language Grid Xinjiang Operation in China were started in 2012 and 2014 respectively. \n</p><p>The four operation centers are connected with each other to realized the federated operation of the Language Grid, which enables sharing of language services among multiple Language Grids.\n</p><p>In May 2017, the operation of Kyoto Language Grid was moved from <a href=\"/wiki/Kyoto_University\" title=\"Kyoto University\">Kyoto University</a> to NPO Language Grid Association.

The multilingual medical communication support system was developed by Wakayama University in cooperation with Kyoto Center for Multicultural Society. This NPO dispatched volunteer interpreters to several affiliated hospitals a total of 1700 times per year. The support system helps communication between foreign outpatients and medical staff at hospital reception desks. Using the system, hospital staff can ask outpatients about their symptoms, and provide guidance around each section in a hospital.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Multilingual_Agricultural_Support\">Multilingual Agricultural Support</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Language_Grid&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Multilingual Agricultural Support\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>NPO Pangaea and universities in Japan and Vietnam worked on an agricultural support project with two major goals: low rice productivity and the environmental burdens caused by the excessive use of agrichemicals. From 2011 to 2014, a four-month experiment was conducted each year in Vinh Long Province, which is located in the Mekong Delta. The goal was to provide timely and appropriate agriculture knowledge in rice harvesting to Vietnamese farmers by Japanese experts. Since Japanese experts cannot physically travel to all rural areas, they were highly motivated to use the Language Grid. However, because of low literacy rate in those areas, the farmers had difficulties in using computers and indeed in reading/writing messages. The youth-mediated communication (YMC) model was invented, where children act as mediators and bridge the gaps in language, knowledge and cultures between experts and farmers.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Language_Grid&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Toru Ishida (ed.)
