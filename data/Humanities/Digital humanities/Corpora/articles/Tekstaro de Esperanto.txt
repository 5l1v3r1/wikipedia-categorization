ESF hired Bertilo Wennergren to plan and create the first phase of the project, which finished at the end of April 2003. Wennergren was aided by Ilona Koutny, Jouko Lindstedt, Carlo Minnaja, Christopher Gledhill, and Mauro La Torre. In 2006 planning of the Parola tekstaro de Esperanto (Speech corpus of Esperanto) was started.
