In 1983, The Right Honorable Edwards Seaga, Prime Minister of Jamaica, felt that, during the twenty-first \"coming of age\" anniversary of independence, a special recognition should be given to Jamaican citizens who had made significant contributions to the Nation, but who had not received any of the National Honours.  A committee was formed of prominent Jamaicans to select recipients with the following criteria:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Have served their Community and Jamaica with distinction for at least twenty years and who are held in high esteem by their community.</li>\n<li>Have not received any of the National Honours.</li>\n<li>Recipients to be at least thirty-eight years old at the time of selection.</li></ul>\n<p>The Prime Minister determined that 1,000 medals would be presented.\nMr. F. A. Douce, the Secretary General of the Orders, Chancery of the Orders of the Societies of Honours, Office of the Prime Minister in Kingston, Jamaica, was commissioned with the design of the Medal.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Presentations\">Presentations</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Prime_Minister%27s_Medal_of_Appreciation&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Presentations\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The first 1,000 presentations were awarded at the Historic Town Square in <a href=\"/wiki/Spanish_Town\" title=\"Spanish Town\">Spanish Town, Jamaica</a> on Sunday, 18 December 1983.  <a href=\"/wiki/Edward_Seaga\" title=\"Edward Seaga\">Prime Minister Seaga</a> personally presented the first 10 medals to the County <a href=\"/wiki/Custos\" title=\"Custos\">Custos</a>.

Recipients who were personally awarded the medal by the Prime Minister included three Champion Boxers, <a href=\"/wiki/Michael_McCallum\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Michael McCallum\">Michael McCallum</a> (3 June 1986), <a href=\"/wiki/Lloyd_Honeyghan\" title=\"Lloyd Honeyghan\">Lloyd Honeyghan</a> (10 November 1985) and <a href=\"/wiki/Trevor_Berbick\" title=\"Trevor Berbick\">Trevor Berbick</a> (10 April 1986).   Nine other prominent Jamaican was awarded the medal, including Jamaican born actress Marge Sinclair (12 March 1987).  \n</p><p>In 1986, the supply of medals became scarce.  It was recommended by the Prime Minister that a new design for the Medal be found to more accurately reflect the current presentations.  Again, Mr. F. A. Douce, the Secretary General of the Orders, was tasked with the design and production of a new Medal.\n</p><p>The first Medal presentation of the new design was given by Jamaican Prime Minister The Right Honorable <a href=\"/wiki/Michael_Norman_Manley\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Michael Norman Manley\">Michael Norman Manley</a> on 27 April 1989 to <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Russell_Ralph_Fritz&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Russell Ralph Fritz (page does not exist)\">Russell Ralph Fritz</a>, a Major in <a href=\"/wiki/The_Salvation_Army\" title=\"The Salvation Army\">The Salvation Army</a>.

This was the first time that Jamaican Prime Minister <a href=\"/wiki/Michael_Manley\" title=\"Michael Manley\">Michael Manley</a> had awarded the Medal.  This was also the first time that a non-Jamaican was awarded the Medal, as Russell Fritz is a native <a href=\"/wiki/California\" title=\"California\">Californian</a>, but his wife Jacqueline was a Jamaican Citizen.  At the time of the Medal presentation, Fritz was assigned by the International Salvation Army to the Caribbean Territorial Headquarters stationed in <a href=\"/wiki/Kingston,_Jamaica\" title=\"Kingston, Jamaica\">Kingston, Jamaica</a>. Fritz had also been the Principal of the School for the Blind and Visually Handicapped in Kingston.
