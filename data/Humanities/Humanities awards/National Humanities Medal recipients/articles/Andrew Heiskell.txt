Andrew Heiskell (September 13, 1915, Naples, Italy - July 6, 2003 Darien, Connecticut) was chairman and CEO of Time Inc. (1960–1980), and also known for his philanthropy, for organizations including the New York Public Library.   He was President of the Inter American Press Association (1961–1962). Heiskell was born in Naples, the second child of American parents, Ann Moore Hubbard and Morgan Ott Heiskell,   who had married in Wheeling, West Virginia and then moved to Capri. He spent his childhood abroad. In 1946, aged just 30, he was named publisher of Life; later, as CEO, he had to close it down (in 1972).  In 1974 he created People, which rapidly became a great asset.  The Institute of International Education's Andrew Heiskell Award is named for him. Heiskell donated funds to pay for the Arts Director position at the American Academy in Rome.  He was married three times. His first wife was Cornelia Scott, and they had two children, Diane and Peter.  His second wife was the Hollywood actress Madeleine Carroll, with whom he had a daughter, Anne Madeleine.  In 1965, he married his third wife, Marian Sulzberger Dryfoos, the widow of New York Times publisher Orvil Dryfoos.
