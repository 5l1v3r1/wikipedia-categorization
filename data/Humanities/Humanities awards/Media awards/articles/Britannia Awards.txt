  The Britannia Awards are presented by BAFTA Los Angeles, a branch of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA), as "a bridge between the Hollywood and British production and entertainment business communities."  Established in 1989, it honours "individuals and companies who have dedicated their careers or corporate missions to advancing the art-forms of the moving image."  From 1989 to 1998, only an honorary award was handed out to an individual during the presentation. By 1999, the accolade was expanded to include additional awards which include: Stanley Kubrick Britannia Award for Excellence in Film,  John Schlesinger Britannia Award for Excellence in Directing, John Schlesinger Britannia Award for Artistic Excellence in Directing, Britannia Award for British Artist of the Year and Charlie Chaplin Britannia Award for Excellence in Comedy.  It is presented at a gala dinner during the month of November and has been televised in the United States from 2010. Occurring in October or November, the Britannia Awards ceremony is presented at a black tie gala dinner, and has been held predominately at the Hyatt Regency Century Plaza and Beverly Hilton Hotel. Stephen Fry has hosted it three times (2006, 2009 and 2010), the most of any other person.
