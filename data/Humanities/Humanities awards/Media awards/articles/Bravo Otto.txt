The Bravo Otto is a German accolade honoring excellence of performers in film, television and music.  Established in 1957, the award is presented annually, with winners selected by the readers of Bravo magazine.  The award is presented in gold, silver and bronze and, since 1996, an honorary platinum statuette presented for lifetime achievement. The award was originally presented only to actors, however, in 1960, additional categories were created to recognize musical artists.  Over time, various categories have been expanded while other categories have been merged or phased out altogether.  As of 2011, the Bravo Otto is presented in a total of 11 competitive categories; Male Film Star, Female Film Star, Male TV Star, Female TV Star, Male Super Singer, Female Super Singer, Super Rapper, Super Rock Band, Super Pop Band, Comedy Star and Internet Star. From 1957 to 1972, The Bravo Otto award ceremony was presented at the beginning of each year.  Beginning in 1972, the date of the ceremony was moved to the end of the year, resulting in the awards being presented twice for the 1972 calendar year. Since 1994, the ceremony has been presented in a one-hour annual show called Der Bravo-Supershow â€“ Die Gold-Otto-Verleihung (roughly translated as The Bravo-Supershow - The Gold Otto Awards) and is broadcast annually on German television. The Otto awards are also presented in other European countries where Bravo publishes regional versions of the magazine.  The most notable of these countries include Russia, the Czech Republic and Poland. In Hungary, the awards are presented in an annual ceremony which is broadcast on television, similar to the German ceremony. The following categories have been awarded by the Otto's throughout its history, with some categories having been "split" or "merged" over time. Since 1994 Bravo-Otto ceremony is shown on private German broadcaster RTL, RTL II and ProSieben.  The following is a list of hosts for each year's ceremony. Bravo (magazine)
