 The Gabriel Awards were started by the Catholic Academy for Communication Arts Professionals in 1965. They are designed to honor excellence in broadcasting.  Awards are given to national and local market radio and television broadcasters to “recognize outstanding artistic achievement ... which entertains and enriches with a true vision of humanity...”  The single most important criterion of a Gabriel winning program is its ability to uplift and nourish the human spirit. Gabriel-worthy programs affirm the dignity of human beings, and recognize and uphold universally-recognized human values such as community, creativity, tolerance, justice, compassion and the dedication to excellence.In 2014, for example, television station WRAL in Raleigh, North Carolina, was recognized by the Gabriel Awards for its news division's production of programs dealing with childhood homelessness and conditions in Haiti.
