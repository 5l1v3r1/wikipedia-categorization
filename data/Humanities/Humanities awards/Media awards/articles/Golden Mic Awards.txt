The Golden Mic Awards (Chinese: 金唛奖; previously known as Singapore Radio Awards) is an accolade by Singapore's MediaCorp  to recognize excellence of presenters and producers in MediaCorp Radio. Although the moniker Singapore may suggest a representation of all radio stations in Singapore, the nominations are only open to deejay talents from MediaCorp Radio.  It was previously known as the Singapore Radio Awards from 2005 to 2011. Prior to the SRA, the three Chinese radio stations (Y.E.S. 93.3FM, Capital 95.8FM and Love 97.2FM) under MediaCorp held their own "Golden Mike Awards" (GMA). The last GMA was held in 2004 and the SRA was born a few months later to encompass stations from all four languages that MediaCorp broadcast in: English, Chinese, Malay and Tamil. The first SRA was held in 2005, and was renamed MRA in 2013. The first SRA ceremony was held in 2004 at Raffles City Convention Centre.  It was a trade event, whereby clients of MediaCorp were invited for a formal sit down dinner. Listeners were not invited to the show.  The 2nd SRA was held in 2005 in Shangri La Hotel's Island Ballroom. The 3rd SRA was held at the same location in 2006. Similarly, only trade clients were invited.    The 4th SRA in 2007 was held at Suntec Convention Centre. For the first time, listeners were invited to purchase tickets to attend.  All nominees were involved in the opening sequence.  The SRA discontinued in 2008 and 2009.  Singapore Radio Awards 2010 was held in MediaCorp's TV Theatre, with a live webcast on its official site.  Florence Lian, former radio DJ and Singapore Idol judge, currently MediaCorp's Managing Director for Radio, opened the show with a monologue. The hosts were Vernon A and Justin Ang from 987FM. Award presenters included Irene Ang, Bobby Tonelli, as well as MediaCorp's senior management.  987FM were the biggest winners for the night, sweeping "Best Radio Show", "Most Creative English Trailer", and "Best Radio Personality Blog". Singapore Radio Awards 2011 was telecast live on Channel 5.  MediaCorp Radio Awards 2013 will be held on 15 November. The show will be telecast live on Channel 5. All weekday presenters were automatically nominated for the "Most Popular DJ" Award for the respective stations. The results are based on SMS polling.  Nominees for other awards were selected by a panel of professionals in the industry.
