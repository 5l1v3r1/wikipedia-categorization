The France Football European Team of the Year (offic. fr. Challenge Europ√©en de Football),  also known as European Challenge Interclubs, was an association football award conferred by French sports magazine France Football with the sponsorship of German multinational corporation Adidas, and was held in Europe for the first time in 1968 based in clubs' performance in seasonal association and UEFA competitions.  The award was officially discontinued following the Adidas decision of not renewing its commercial contract with the French publication after it awarded the 1990 winner teams in a gala held in Paris, in January 1991.  Subsequently, the Germany's designs and manufacturers corporation became the main sponsor of the FIFA World Player of the Year Award.
