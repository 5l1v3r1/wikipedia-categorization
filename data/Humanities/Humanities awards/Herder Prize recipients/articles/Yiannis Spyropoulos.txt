Yiannis Spyropoulos (Greek: Γιάννης Σπυρόπουλος) (March 12, 1912 – May 18, 1990) was a famous Greek painter of the second half of the 20th century. Spyropoulos was born in Pylos of Messenia.  In 1933 he was accepted at the Athens School of Fine Arts. His teachers included Spyridon Vikatos, Oumbertos Argyros and Epameinondas Thomopoulos.  Eight years later the Academy of Athens rewards Spyropoulos with the first prize and the opportunity to study in the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris. During his studies he was taught by Charles-François-Prosper Guérin.
