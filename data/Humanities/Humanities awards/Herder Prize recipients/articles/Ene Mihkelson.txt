Ene Mihkelson (21 October 1944 in Tammeküla, Imavere Parish, Viljandi County – 20 September 2017 in Tartu) was an Estonian writer.  Mihkelson studied literature after completing her secondary education.  She worked as a teacher and then as a researcher for the Estonian Literary Museum. Mihkelson wrote throughout her life.  She published her first literary piece in 1967.  However, her first collection of poems did not appear until 1978.  Her father opposed the Soviet forces in Estonia in the middle of the 20th century.  The authorities, therefore, did not approve of her. Since the breakup of the Soviet Union, Mihkelson has published ten poetry anthologies.  Her poetry lacks meter, rhythm and rhyme, but contains surprising inversions.  It is known for its intensity, allegorical content and metaphysical topics. Mihkelson has also published four novels, a selection of critical essays (Kirjanduse seletusi, or Explanations of Literature) and a collection of short stories (Surma sünnipäev, or The Birthday of Death). IN 2001 she published the novel Ahasveeruse uni. Mihkelson's works frequently include allusions to her childhood, spent in hiding, Estonian mythology, and Estonian history. In 2006 she was awarded the Herder Prize and in 2010 the Baltic Assembly Prize for Literature.  Media related to Ene Mihkelson at Wikimedia Commons
