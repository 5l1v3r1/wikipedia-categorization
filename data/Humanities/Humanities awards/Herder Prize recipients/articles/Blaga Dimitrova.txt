Blaga Nikolova Dimitrova (Bulgarian: Блага Димитрова) (2 January 1922 – 2 May 2003) was a Bulgarian poet and Vice President of Bulgaria  from 1992 until 1993. Born in Byala Slatina to a mother teacher and a father lawyer, Blaga Dimitrova was raised in Veliko Tarnovo and then moved to Sofia. She finished High School in 1942, and Slavic Philology at the University of Sofia in 1945. In the 1970s, her works became more critical of the communist government, and she received reprimands for not being politically correct. Four of the poetry books Dimitrova wrote in the 1970s- "Fireflies Fading", "Rubber Plant", "Questions", and "Hobbyada"- were all rejected by state publishing houses with no specific reason given.  Blaga Dimitrova was the inspiration behind John Updike's short story "The Bulgarian Poetess".  During the Vietnam War, Dimitrova visited the country several times as a journalist, and in 1967 adopted a Vietnamese girl. Dimitrova was married to literary critic Jordan Vasilev. She died on 2 May 2003.
