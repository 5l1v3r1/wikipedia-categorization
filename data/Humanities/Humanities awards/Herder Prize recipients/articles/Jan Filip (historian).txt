Jan Filip (born 25 December 1900 in Chocnějovice, died 30 April  1981 in Prague) was a Czech prehistorian. Filip was Professor of prehistory at Prague University, director of the Archaeological Institute and member of the Czech Academy of Sciences. He wrote numerous scholarly publications, among them two of the fundamental reference works for archaeological research in Central Europe. He also founded the professional journal Archeologické rozhledy, published since 1949. Filip influenced the generations of Czech researchers who followed him, setting an example with his statements not hindered by national or political concerns. A great part of his work remains relevant to this day.
