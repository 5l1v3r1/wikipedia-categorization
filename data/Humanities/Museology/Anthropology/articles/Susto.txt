Susto (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈsusto], Portuguese pronunciation: [ˈsuʃtu]) is a cultural illness primarily among Latin American cultures.  It is described by Razzouk et al. as a condition of being frightened and "chronic somatic suffering stemming from emotional trauma or from witnessing traumatic experiences lived by others".  Among the indigenous peoples of Latin America, in which this illness is most common, susto may be conceptualized as a case of spirit attack.  Symptoms of susto are thought to include nervousness, anorexia, insomnia, listlessness, fever, depression, and diarrhea.  Susto may be a culturally dependent variation of the symptoms of panic attack, distinct from anxiety and depressive disorders.
