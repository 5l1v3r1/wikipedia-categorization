In 1956, Anthony F. C. Wallace published a paper called "Revitalization Movements"   to describe how cultures change themselves.   A revitalization movement is a "deliberate, organized, conscious effort by members of a society to construct a more satisfying culture" (p.Â 265), and Wallace describes at length the processes by which a revitalization movement takes place. Wallace' model 1956 describes the process of a revitalization movement. It is derived from studies of a Native American religious movement, The Code of Handsome Lake, which may have led to the formation of the Longhouse Religion.  Wallace derived his theory from studies of so-called primitive peoples (preliterate and homogeneous), with particular attention to the Iroquois revitalization movement led by Seneca religious leader and prophet Handsome Lake (1735-1815). Wallace believed that his revitalization model applies to movements as broad and complex as the rise of Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, or Wesleyan Methodism. Revitalizaton is a part of social movements. Scholars such as Vittorio Lanternari (1963) and Peter Worsley (1968) have developed and adapted Wallace's insights.
