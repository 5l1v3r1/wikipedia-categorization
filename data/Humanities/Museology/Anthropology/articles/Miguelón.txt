Miguelón is the popular nickname for the earliest skull of Homo neanderthalensis ever found. It has been estimated to date to 430,000 years ago. More than 5,500 human fossils of this populations have been found in the Sima de los Huesos ("pit of bones") site in the Sierra de Atapuerca in northern Spain.  The excavators suggest that this concentration of bones in the pit may represent the practice of burial by the inhabitants of the cave. A competing theory cites the lack of small bones in the assemblage and suggests that the remains were washed into the pit by natural agents. Previously they were considered to be Homo heidelbergensis which are considered to be the possible direct ancestor of Homo neanderthalensis but genetic analysis revealed that they were archaic neanderthals instead.  Miguelón, around thirty years old, had suffered 13 impacts in the head and died of sepsis resulting from broken teeth. In his upper left jaw there is an important bone alteration, with evidence of alveolar infection. According to Arsuaga, a tooth had been broken in life by a strong blow, so that the flesh had been exposed and led to an infectious process that continued until nearly the orbital bone.   The cranial capacity is around 1100cc.  The nickname Miguelón was derived from Miguel Indurain, a retired Spanish road racing cyclist that won the Tour and Giro in 1992, the year in which this skull was discovered.
