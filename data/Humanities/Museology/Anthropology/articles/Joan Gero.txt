Joan M. Gero (26 May 1944 – 14 July 2016) was an American archaeologist and pioneer of feminist archaeology. Her research focused on gender and power issues in prehistory, particularly in the Andean regions of Argentina and Peru.  Gero was born in New York City on 26 May 1944. She graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a BA in English Literature in 1968, before receiving an M.Ed from Boston College in 1970.  The next two years were spent teaching socioeconomically disadvantaged groups with the Teacher Corps.  In 1972 Gero studied archaeology during a summer course in Oxford, excavating at an Iron Age site in Wiltshire.  In 1974 Gero began graduate studies at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, with Martin Wobst,  gaining a Phd in Anthropology in 1983.  Gero taught at the University of South Carolina from 1983 to 1997.  With Margaret Conkey she co-edited the groundbreaking 1991 volume Engendering Archaeology: Women and Prehistory, reprinted six times, which stemmed from a 1988 conference “Women and Production in Prehistory".    Gero  has held visiting professorships at Cambridge University, the Universidad Nacional de Catamarca, the University of Umeå, University of Uppsala, and the Universidad Nacional del Centro de Buenos Aires, Olavarría, Argentina.  In 1998 Gero was appointed Assistant Professor at American University in Washington, D.C., where she taught courses in archaeology, anthropology and women's studies. Gero was also a research associate at the Department of Anthropology at the Smithsonian Institution. At the time of her death she was a professor emerita.  Gero received funding from Fulbright, the National Science Foundation, the Wenner-Gren Foundation, the Heintz foundation, and the National Endowment for the Humanities.
