{"parse":{"title":"Cognized environment","pageid":8739390,"revid":387717526,"text":{"*":"<div class=\"mw-parser-output\"><p><b>Cognized environment</b> is a concept first introduced by the late anthropologist, <a href=\"/wiki/Roy_Rappaport\" title=\"Roy Rappaport\">Roy Rappaport</a> (1968), in contrast to what he called the <i>operational environment</i> (see Rappaport 1979:97-144, 1984:337-352).  Rappaport was an ecological anthropologist, like <a href=\"/wiki/Andrew_P._Vayda\" title=\"Andrew P. Vayda\">Andrew P. Vayda</a>, and wished to contrast the actual reality and adaptations (the operational environment) within a people's ecological niche  \u2013 say, the existence of tsetse flies and their role in causing sleeping sickness among humans \u2013 with how the people\u2019s culture understands nature (the cognized environment) \u2013 say, the belief that witches live in those areas that science knows is the habitat of the tsetse.  Rappaport\u2019s principal concern was the role of ritual in mediating the cognized and operational environments.\n</p><p>Another group of anthropologists later took up the use of Rappaport\u2019s concepts and applied them toward developing a school of <a href=\"/wiki/Neuroanthropology\" title=\"Neuroanthropology\">neuroanthropology</a> called <a href=\"/wiki/Biogenetic_Structuralism\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Biogenetic Structuralism\">Biogenetic Structuralism</a> (see Laughlin and Brady 1978: 6, d'Aquili, Laughlin and McManus 1979: 12ff, Rubinstein, Laughlin and McManus 1984: 21ff, and Laughlin, McManus and d'Aquili 1990:82-90).  According to this group, all properties and qualities of experience are mediated by our body\u2019s neuroendocrine systems.  These systems function individually and collectively to model reality.  The sum total of these models in the brain is the cognized environment.  The operational environment refers to the actual niche in which the human or other animal with a brain dwells and adapts.  The operational environment is the real world that is modelled by our cognized environment.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Cognized_environment&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Umwelt\" title=\"Umwelt\">Umwelt</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Cognized_environment&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li>D'Aquili, Eugene G., Charles D.
