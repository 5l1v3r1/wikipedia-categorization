Saldanha man also known as Saldanha cranium or Elandsfontein cranium are fossilized remains of an archaic human, identified as Homo heidelbergensis. The remains, which included a fragment of lower jaw, were found on an exposed surface between shifting sand dunes on the farm Elandsfontein, which is located near Hopefield, South Africa. To date it remains the southernmost hominid find. It was found associated with a variety of fossil vertebrates.  Ronald Singer illustrated that the skull is broadly similar to that of Rhodesian man in terms of outline and measurements.
