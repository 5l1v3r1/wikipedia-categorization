In Christianity, an unreached people group refers to an ethnic group without an indigenous, self-propagating Christian church movement.  Any ethnic or ethnolinguistic nation without enough Christians to evangelize the rest of the nation is an "unreached people group". It is a missiological  term used by Evangelical Christians.      The Lausanne Committee for World Evangelization defines a people group as "the largest group within which the Gospel can spread as a church planting movement without encountering barriers of understanding or acceptance."    "Nation" is sometimes used interchangeably for "people group". The term is sometimes applied to ethnic groups in which less than 2% of the population is Evangelical Christian.    The Great Commission of Christianity is a Biblical mandate to make Christian disciples in every nation of the world. According to the Biblical books of Matthew, Mark and Luke, these were the final instructions of Jesus Christ before he is stated to have ascended into heaven. This is a basic tenet of Evangelical Christianity.  Therefore, spreading Christianity to the remaining people groups without access to it is a goal of some adherents of the faith today.
