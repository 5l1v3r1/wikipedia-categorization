The Open Archives Initiative Object Reuse and Exchange (OAI-ORE) defines standards for the description and exchange of aggregations of web resources. The OAI-ORE specification implements the ORE Model which introduces the resource map (ReM) that makes it possible to associate an identity with aggregations of resources and make assertions about their structure and semantics. These aggregations (sometimes called compound digital objects or compound information objects) may combine distributed resources together, and with multiple media types including text, images, data, and video. The goal of OAI-ORE is to expose the rich content in aggregations to applications that support authoring, deposit, exchange, visualization, reuse, and preservation. The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation funded two years of work on the OAI-ORE project in 2006-2008.  Version 1.0 of the specification was released on 17 October 2008.  The ORE standard is concerned with the description of aggregations of web resources. It defines 4 entities: The standard accounts for the possible redundant description of the same aggregation and defines the notion of authoritative Resource Map. It also consider the notions of similar aggregations and of type of aggregated resources. The standard is open in the sense that a Resource Map may include any additional assertions about resources. Finally, the ORE standard builds upon the Cool URIs   guideline, which discussed two strategies for not confusing a thing and some representation of it.
