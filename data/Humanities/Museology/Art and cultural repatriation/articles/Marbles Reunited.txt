Marbles Reunited: Friends of the British Committee for the Reunification of the Parthenon Marbles is a campaign group, governed by charter and funded by donations from members and supporters, which lobbies and raises awareness about the case for the return of the Parthenon (Elgin) marbles to Athens, Greece. The organization was set up in 2001 by Richard Allan, Liberal Democrats Member of Parliament for Sheffield Hallam and Archaeologist. Initially the campaign was called Parthenon 2004. The members of the committee hoped that the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens would act as a catalyst to renew interest and raise awareness about the reunification of the Parthenon Marbles. In 2005 the organization changed its name to Marbles Reunited to reflect the ongoing aspirations of the campaign, while not being tied to a specific date. The current executive committee members are: Other members of the organisation include: The original members of the Committee were: The members of Marbles Reunited have organised and/or had significant involvement in a large number of events throughout the United Kingdom and abroad.

In 2008, Marbles Reunited was accepted as a member of the International Association for the Reunification of the Parthenon Sculptures.
