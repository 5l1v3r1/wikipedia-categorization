India Pride Project (IPP) is a group of art enthusiasts who uses social media to identify stolen religious artefacts from Indian temples and secure their return. Founded by two Singapore-based art enthusiasts, it now has activists from all over the world.    In 2014, it helped to secure the return of a US$5 million bronze statue of the Hindu god Shiva from the National Gallery of Australia. Named Dancing Shiva, the statue was stolen from a Tamil Nadu temple and trafficked by Subhash Kapoor, a former Manhattan art dealer who was later under the United States federal investigation known as Operation Hidden Idol. When the gallery denied the statue was stolen, IPP used the social media to publicize and compare the images of the stolen idol with the one on gallery's display. Since the arrest of Kapoor in 2012, United States has returned to India many artefacts recovered under Operation Hidden Idol. Ms Donna Yates, a lecturer on antiquities trafficking at the University of Glasgow, believes "the grassroots work of the IPP in documenting cases of theft and bringing them to public attention is crucial - and unmatched anywhere in the world."
