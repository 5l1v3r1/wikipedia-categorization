The remains were dated by way of radiocarbon dating and evaluation of artifacts which had been intentionally buried with him. They were analyzed, but it was not possible to extract the Tuqan Man's DNA, though increasingly better testing techniques and methods became available and were utilized over the 12 years that passed after his original discovery. The remains were studied before their return to the island, which was delayed by resolution of tribal identification and ownership issues contingent on resolution of the precedent-setting <a href=\"/wiki/Kennewick_Man\" title=\"Kennewick Man\">Kennewick Man</a> case from Washington State. Analysis of the bones indicated that he was in his forties when he died, and had spent time some distance east of what is now the Santa Barbara coastal region. Under procedures in accordance with the <a href=\"/wiki/Native_American_Graves_Protection_and_Repatriation_Act\" title=\"Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act\">Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act</a> (NAGPRA), in May, 2018, they were restored to the claiming Chumash tribe, for reburial on the island.
