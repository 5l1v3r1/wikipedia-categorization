 The Celts: Rich Traditions and Ancient Myths is a 1987 documentary series that examines the origins, growth, and influence of Celtic culture in Great Britain and throughout Europe. The series was directed by David Richardson, written and presented by Frank Delaney, produced by the British Broadcasting Corporation, and broadcast on BBC Two. The series was released on DVD in Europe and North America in 2004. Delaney also wrote a six-chapter companion book, extended with four tales from Irish mythology. The series introduced the music of Irish singer Enya to a wider audience. Enya, formerly a member of the Celtic music group Clannad, was commissioned by David Richardson to compose the score for the series. Each episode of the series begins with video of Enya lip syncing the series' theme song, "The Celts". Two episodes include music videos of her performing the songs "I Want Tomorrow" and "Aldebaran". In one scene from the video for "I Want Tomorrow", Enya is dressed in motorcycle leathers; in another, she shoots fire from her fingertips. The DVD includes an interview and musical performances by Enya. The soundtrack album for The Celts was first released in 1987 by BBC Records under the title Enya. It reached No.69 in the UK albums chart.  It was later reissued in North America by Atlantic Records. In 1992, Reprise Records, the licensees of Enya's later popular recordings such as "Orinoco Flow", obtained the rights to the Enya album and it was remastered and reissued under the title The Celts. This time the album reached No.10 in the UK.  Also, Enya appeared in a new music video to promote the title song, and a CD-single of the theme song was released.
