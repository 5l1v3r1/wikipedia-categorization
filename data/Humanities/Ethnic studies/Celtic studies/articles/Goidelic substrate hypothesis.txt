The Goidelic substrate hypothesis refers to the hypothesized language or languages spoken in Ireland before the Iron Age arrival of the Goidelic languages. Ireland was settled, like the rest of northern Europe, after the retreat of the ice sheets c. 10,500 BC.  Indo-European languages are usually thought to have been a much later arrival. Some evidence suggests that the Goidelic languages may have been brought by the Bell Beaker Culture circa 2500 BC, in contrast to the generally accepted theory that it was brought by the advent of the Iron Age. Scholars have suggested that: Gearóid Mac Eoin proposes the following words as deriving from the substrate: bréife 'ring, loop', cufar, cuifre/cuipre 'kindness', fafall/fubhal, lufe 'feminine', slife, strophais 'straw'; and the following placenames: Bréifne, Crufait, Dún Gaifi, Faffand, Grafand, Grafrenn, Life/Mag Liphi, Máfat.  Peter Schrijver submits the following words as deriving from the substrate: partán 'crab', Partraige (ethnonym), (note that partaing "crimson (Parthian) red" is a loanword from Lat. parthicus), pattu 'hare', petta 'pet, lap-dog', pell 'horse', pít 'portion of food', pluc '(round) mass', prapp 'rapid', gliomach 'lobster', faochán 'periwinkle', ciotóg 'left hand', bradán 'salmon', scadán 'herring'.  In a further study he gives counter-arguments against some criticisms by Graham Isaac.   Ranko Matasović points out that there are words of possibly or probably non-Indo-European origin in other Celtic languages as well; therefore, the substrate may not have been in contact with Primitive Irish but rather with Proto-Celtic.  Examples of words found in more than one branch of Celtic but with no obvious cognates outside Celtic include:
