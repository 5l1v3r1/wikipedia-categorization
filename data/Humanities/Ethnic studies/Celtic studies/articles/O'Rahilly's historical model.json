They spoke a <a href=\"/wiki/Brittonic_languages\" title=\"Brittonic languages\">Brittonic language</a> and called themselves <i>Priteni</i> or <i>Pritani</i>. The impact they had upon the native inhabitants can be inferred from the fact that <a href=\"/wiki/Ancient_Greece\" title=\"Ancient Greece\">Greek</a> geographers were referring to these islands as the \u201c<a href=\"/wiki/Britain_(place_name)\" title=\"Britain (place name)\">Pretanic Islands</a>\u201d (<span lang=\"grc\" title=\"Ancient Greek language text\">\u03b1\u03b9 \u03a0\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03bf\u03b9</span>) by at least 300 BC. It is also possible that the very name \u201cBritain\u201d is derived from Priteni. However, there is no hard evidence for a Pretanic invasion as such. It is much more likely that their settlement of these islands was a gradual one, spread over several centuries.\n</p><p>In Britain, these Priteni were absorbed by later invaders and lost their cultural identity, except in the far north where they were known to the <a href=\"/wiki/Roman_Empire\" title=\"Roman Empire\">Romans</a> as the <a href=\"/wiki/Picts\" title=\"Picts\"><i>Picti</i></a> \"painted people\", on account of their practice of decorating their bodies with tattoos (a practice which by then had died out among other Celtic nations).\n</p><p>In Ireland, too, the Priteni were largely absorbed by later settlers; but a few pockets of them managed to retain a measure of cultural, if not political, independence well into the Christian era. By then they were identified as <i>Cruithne</i>, a Goidelic adaptation of the Brittonic word Priteni. Both words are derived from a root meaning \u201cto shape\u201d or \u201ccreate.\u201d Celtic tribes generally gave themselves names which were the pluralised forms of names they gave to their deities (in this case \u201cthe Creator\u201d). Among the Cruthin tribes that survived into the Christian era the most prominent were the <a href=\"/wiki/D%C3%A1l_nAraidi\" title=\"D\u00e1l nAraidi\">D\u00e1l nAraidi</a> in <a href=\"/wiki/Ulster\" title=\"Ulster\">Ulster</a>, and the <i>Lo\u00edges</i> and <i>Fothairt</i> in <a href=\"/wiki/Leinster\" title=\"Leinster\">Leinster</a>. The name of the second of these tribes, modernized as <i>Laois</i>, has been revived and given to <a href=\"/wiki/County_Laois\" title=\"County Laois\">County Laois</a>, Leinster (formerly \"Queen's County\").\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Bolgic_or_Ernean_invasion\">The Bolgic or Ernean invasion</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=O%27Rahilly%27s_historical_model&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: The Bolgic or Ernean invasion\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Around 500 BC the Cruthin lost their dominant position in Irish society when the country was invaded by a second wave of P-Celtic speakers. These were the Builg or \u00c9rainn. The former name (originally Bolgi) identifies them as <a href=\"/wiki/Belgae\" title=\"Belgae\">Belgae</a>,<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> a Celtic people mentioned by <a href=\"/wiki/Julius_Caesar\" title=\"Julius Caesar\">Julius Caesar</a> in <i><a href=\"/wiki/Commentarii_de_Bello_Gallico\" title=\"Commentarii de Bello Gallico\">Commentarii de Bello Gallico</a></i>.\n</p><p>Their other name, originally Iverni, is probably the origin of several of the early Classical names for Ireland: the Greek \u0399\u03b5\u03c1\u03bd\u03b7; \u0399\u03bf\u03c5\u03b5\u03c1\u03bd\u03b9\u03b1 and possibly also the <a href=\"/wiki/Latin\" title=\"Latin\">Latin</a> <i><a href=\"/wiki/Hibernia\" title=\"Hibernia\">Hibernia</a></i>. In Irish mythology, the name <a href=\"/wiki/Fir_Bolg\" title=\"Fir Bolg\">Fir Bolg</a> obviously refers to the same people. It appears that groups of these Belgae colonised Britain and Ireland in the late sixth or early fifth century. In both islands they absorbed and subjugated most of the previous inhabitants.\n</p><p>Among the more prominent Ernean tribes were the following:\n</p>\n<ul><li>The <a href=\"/wiki/Uluti\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Uluti\">Uluti</a> (<a href=\"/wiki/Middle_Irish\" title=\"Middle Irish\">Middle Irish</a>: <a href=\"/wiki/Ulaid\" title=\"Ulaid\">Ulaid</a>), after whom Ulster is named. For centuries the Uluti were the dominant tribe in the north of the country. They founded <a href=\"/wiki/Navan_Fort\" title=\"Navan Fort\">Navan Fort</a>, the traditional capital of Ulster, near <a href=\"/wiki/Armagh\" title=\"Armagh\">Armagh</a>. In later historical times their descendants were known as the <a href=\"/wiki/D%C3%A1l_Fiatach\" title=\"D\u00e1l Fiatach\">D\u00e1l Fiatach</a> and were confined to the eastern half of <a href=\"/wiki/County_Down\" title=\"County Down\">County Down</a>.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"/wiki/Darini\" title=\"Darini\">Darini</a> and Robogdii (or Reidodioi), two tribes whose territory was in Antrim and north Down.

Three names can be distinguished for them, but whether they were one tribe with three different names or three closely allied but separate tribes we cannot say. These names, as given in later written records, are Laigin, Domnainn and G\u00e1lioin. According to their own traditions, they came to Ireland from <a href=\"/wiki/Armorica\" title=\"Armorica\">Armorica</a> (<a href=\"/wiki/Brittany\" title=\"Brittany\">Brittany</a>). They landed in the southeast of the country and took the southeastern quarter from the \u00c9rainn. The modern name of this province, <a href=\"/wiki/Leinster\" title=\"Leinster\">Leinster</a> (Irish: Laighin), preserves the memory of this Laginian conquest, although in ancient times it was much smaller than the modern province. Before the Goidelic invasion, the <a href=\"/wiki/River_Liffey\" title=\"River Liffey\">River Liffey</a> marked the boundary between Ulster and Leinster. The Domnainn were clearly a branch of the <a href=\"/wiki/Dumnonii\" title=\"Dumnonii\">Dumnonii</a>, a Celtic people identified by Classical authors as inhabiting <a href=\"/wiki/Dumnonia\" title=\"Dumnonia\">Dumnonia</a> (the English counties of <a href=\"/wiki/Cornwall\" title=\"Cornwall\">Cornwall</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Devon\" title=\"Devon\">Devon</a>, to which they gave their name). Another branch of the Dumnonii settled in Scotland, where they founded <a href=\"/wiki/Dumbarton\" title=\"Dumbarton\">Dumbarton</a> and established the kingdom later known as <a href=\"/wiki/Strathclyde\" title=\"Strathclyde\">Strathclyde</a>. Presumably these settlements occurred at around the same time as the Laginian invasion of Ireland. It is even possible that the Dumnonii of Scotland were originally Irish Domnainn.\n</p><p>The Laginian invasion made little impact in Ulster or Munster, where Ernean tribes continued to be the dominant force. But the same cannot be said for <a href=\"/wiki/Connacht\" title=\"Connacht\">Connacht</a>, the westernmost of the four provinces. Sometime in the third century (all these dates, it should be pointed out, are highly conjectural) they crossed the <a href=\"/wiki/River_Shannon\" title=\"River Shannon\">River Shannon</a> and subjugated the Ernean tribes of Connacht. The decisive battle, the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Cath_Maige_Tuired\" title=\"Cath Maige Tuired\">Cath Maige Tuired</a></i>, was fought in <a href=\"/wiki/County_Sligo\" title=\"County Sligo\">County Sligo</a> in a place called Mag Tuired. There a Laginian king (possibly known as Cairbre) overthrew the \u00c9rainn and drove them out of Connacht. According to Irish records the defeated \u00c9rainn sought refuge in many of the islands around Ireland. The fortresses of <a href=\"/wiki/D%C3%BAn_Aonghasa\" title=\"D\u00fan Aonghasa\">D\u00fan Aonghasa</a> and <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=D%C3%BAn_Conor&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"D\u00fan Conor (page does not exist)\">D\u00fan Conor</a> on the <a href=\"/wiki/Aran_Islands\" title=\"Aran Islands\">Aran Islands</a>, and <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=D%C3%BAn_Balor&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"D\u00fan Balor (page does not exist)\">D\u00fan Balor</a> on <a href=\"/wiki/Tory_Island\" title=\"Tory Island\">Tory Island</a>, are thought to have been built by them.\n</p><p>O'Rahilly claims that it was probably as a result of the Laginian conquests that Ireland first came to be divided into four provinces. The \u00c9rainn continued to rule in Ulster and Munster, while the Lagin and their allies became the dominant force in Leinster and Connacht. Traditionally these four provinces met at the exact centre of the country, which was marked by the <a href=\"/wiki/Hill_of_Uisneach\" title=\"Hill of Uisneach\">Hill of Uisneach</a> (between <a href=\"/wiki/Mullingar\" title=\"Mullingar\">Mullingar</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Athlone\" title=\"Athlone\">Athlone</a> in <a href=\"/wiki/County_Westmeath\" title=\"County Westmeath\">County Westmeath</a>), a name which may mean \"vertex\" or \"angular place\". The district immediately surrounding this hill was originally called <i>Medion</i> \"middle\", and is the origin of the name of <a href=\"/wiki/County_Meath\" title=\"County Meath\">County Meath</a>. Julius Caesar informs us that the druids of <a href=\"/wiki/Gaul\" title=\"Gaul\">Gaul</a> regularly assembled at a hallowed spot in the centre of the country to celebrate their rituals (<i>De Bello Gallico</i> 6.13). Irish tradition records that a similar assembly, the M\u00f3rd\u00e1il Uisnig, periodically took place at the Hill of Uisneach on <a href=\"/wiki/Beltane\" title=\"Beltane\">Beltane</a>, the May-day festival.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Goidelic_invasion\">The Goidelic invasion</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=O%27Rahilly%27s_historical_model&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: The Goidelic invasion\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The fourth and final Celtic invasion of Ireland was the Goidelic or Gaelic invasion. Unlike the previous invaders, the Goidels spoke a Q-Celtic language, which was the forerunner of Modern Irish, <a href=\"/wiki/Scottish_Gaelic\" title=\"Scottish Gaelic\">Scottish Gaelic</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Manx_language\" title=\"Manx language\">Manx</a>. The P-Celtic dialects which were spoken in the country at the time of their arrival (and which they referred to as Iarnb\u00e9lre, \u201clanguage of the \u00c9rainn\u201d) eventually became extinct. The Goidels originated in <a href=\"/wiki/Gallia_Aquitania\" title=\"Gallia Aquitania\">Gallia Aquitania</a> in southwestern Gaul. Around 100 BC two groups of these Celts emigrated to Ireland:\n</p><p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Connachta\" title=\"Connachta\">Connachta</a> were named after <a href=\"/wiki/Conn_of_the_Hundred_Battles\" title=\"Conn of the Hundred Battles\">Conn of the Hundred Battles</a>, a mythical ancestor who was later <a href=\"/wiki/Euhemerism\" title=\"Euhemerism\">euhemerized</a> and given a place in Irish history. The Connachta were led by a man known to later history as <a href=\"/wiki/T%C3%BAathal_Techtmar\" title=\"T\u00faathal Techtmar\">T\u00faathal Techtmar</a>. They landed at the mouth of the <a href=\"/wiki/River_Boyne\" title=\"River Boyne\">Boyne</a> and pushed inland to <a href=\"/wiki/Tara,_Ireland\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Tara, Ireland\">Tara</a>, the seat of the local Ernean king, which they sacked. They soon carved out for themselves a new province between Ulster and Leinster, running from the mouth of the Liffey to the mouth of the Boyne and inland as far as the Shannon. In time, this fifth province came to be known as \u201cMeath,\u201d presumably for no other reason than that it contained the Hill of Uisnech.\n</p><p>The other group were known as the <a href=\"/wiki/E%C3%B3ganachta\" title=\"E\u00f3ganachta\">E\u00f3ganachta</a>. Their leader is known to history as Mogh (or Mug) Nuadat. The Eoganachta landed at a place called <i>Inber Sc\u00e9ne</i>, usually identified with <a href=\"/wiki/Kenmare\" title=\"Kenmare\">Kenmare</a> River in the southwest of the country. Unlike the Connachta, they did not carve out a new province for themselves. Instead, they slowly but gradually rose in power, eventually becoming the dominant force in Munster. The names E\u00f3ganachta and Mug Nuadat, which were probably adopted after their arrival, suggest that initially there were friendly relations between them and the \u00c9rainn, as both names are derived from the titles of Ernean deities. \nEarly in their history, the Connachta subjugated the Laginian tribes of Leinster and reduced them to a state of vassalage. The Laginian leaders were allowed to retain possession of their territory, but a heavy tribute was imposed upon them. Known as the B\u00f3rama (or B\u00f3r\u00fa), it continued to be exacted at irregular intervals until the 8th century of the common era. According to one tradition, it was Tuathal Techtmar himself who first imposed this tribute on the Lagin.\n</p><p>As their name suggests, the Connachta did not stop when they reached the Shannon. At an indeterminable point in history, some of them crossed the Shannon and conquered the western province, bestowing their name on it in the process. By the late 4th century of the common era Ireland was divided politically into five provinces or \"overkingdoms\":\n</p>\n<ul><li>Ulster was still dominated by Ernean tribes</li>\n<li>Meath, or the Midland territory, included Tara and was ruled by Gaelic tribes</li>\n<li>Leinster was held by Gaelicized tribes subject to Meath</li>\n<li>Munster was ruled by Gaelic tribes</li>\n<li>Connacht was ruled by Gaelic tribes</li></ul>\n<p>As can be seen, most of the country was in the hands of the Gael. Only Ulster remained independent, but this was not to last.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=O%27Rahilly%27s_historical_model&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li>O'Rahilly, T.
