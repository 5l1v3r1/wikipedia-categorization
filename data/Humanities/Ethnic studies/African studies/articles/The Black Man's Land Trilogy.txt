The Black Man's Land Trilogy is a series of documentary films on colonialism, nationalism and revolution in Africa, filmed in Kenya in 1970 and released in 1973, and still widely used in African studies programs internationally. The three titles are White Man's Country, Mau Mau, and Kenyatta.  John J. O'Connor of the New York Times called it "A solid historical document skewed, valuably, to a distinctive African point of view."
