The Gypsy Lore Society was founded in Great Britain in 1888 to unite persons interested in the history and lore of Gypsies and rovers and to establish closer contacts among scholars studying aspects of such cultures. David MacRitchie was one of its founders and he worked with Francis Hindes Groome until 1892 to produce its  quarterly journal.  From 1892, the organisation was dormant until its revival in 1907, when MacRitchie became its president. Another early member of the society was Sir Richard Burton, who wrote  from Trieste in 1888:  Since 1989 it has been headquartered in the United States. Its goals include promotion of the study of Roma, Gypsies and Travelers. Gypsy Lore Society publications include journal ROMANI STUDIES continuing Journal of the Gypsy Lore Society and Newsletter of the Gypsy Lore Society. The biannual journal, Romani Studies, concerned with disseminating accurate information aimed at increasing understanding of these cultures in their diverse forms. The Journal of the Gypsy Lore Society appeared in four series, starting in July 1888. The Society's archives are held at the University of Liverpool. Among the Gypsy and Traveler cultures represented include those traditionally known as Roma, Sinti, Cal√©, Romnichels, Ludar, Irish Travellers, Scottish Travellers and others. The Society also sponsors programs and conferences. The North American chapter of the Society established the Victor Weybright Archives of Gypsy Studies in 1978, specializing in recent scholarly work on Gypsy, Traveler and related studies, for the benefit of researchers and students.  This research collection is now housed at Michigan State University Special Collections. Current president of the Gypsy Lore Society is Elena Marushiakova.
