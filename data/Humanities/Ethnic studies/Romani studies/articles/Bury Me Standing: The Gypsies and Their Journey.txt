Bury Me Standing: The Gypsies and Their Journey is a best-selling non-fiction book on the lives of the Romani people by the American-Uruguayan writer Isabel Fonseca published in 1995. Fonseca lived and traveled with the Gypsies of Bulgaria, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, the former Yugoslavia, Romania and Albania for four years to write the book.  The title "Bury me standing" comes from a proverb which describes the plight of the Gypsies: "Bury me standing. I've been on my knees all my life." The book is organized in eight chapters and contains black and white photographs and maps.
