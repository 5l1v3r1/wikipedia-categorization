In 1968 he was the first person hired to coordinate a <a href=\"/wiki/African_American_studies\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"African American studies\">black studies</a> program at the university level in the United States, which he set up at <a href=\"/wiki/San_Francisco_State_University\" title=\"San Francisco State University\">San Francisco State University</a>. A graduate of <a href=\"/wiki/Langston_University\" title=\"Langston University\">Langston University</a> and the <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_Chicago\" title=\"University of Chicago\">University of Chicago</a>, he had become involved in the <a href=\"/wiki/Black_Power\" title=\"Black Power\">Black Power</a> movement while teaching at <a href=\"/wiki/Howard_University\" title=\"Howard University\">Howard University</a>.\n</p><p>After being fired as chair of the Black Studies program at San Francisco State, in November 1969 Hare and <a href=\"/wiki/Robert_Chrisman\" title=\"Robert Chrisman\">Robert Chrisman</a> co-founded the journal, <i>The Negro Scholar</i> (now <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Black_Scholar\" title=\"The Black Scholar\">The Black Scholar</a>: A Journal of Black Studies and Research</i>). They worked together for several years.\n</p><p>After earning his second Ph.D., in clinical psychology, Hare set up a private practice in Oakland and San Francisco. Together with his wife, Dr. Julia Hare, he founded the Black Think Tank and for several years published a periodical, <i>Black Male/Female Relationships.</i> He and his wife have written and published several books together on black families and history.\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Early_life_and_education\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Early life and education</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Marriage_and_family\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Marriage and family</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Academic_career_and_Black_Studies\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Academic career and Black Studies</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Books\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Books</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Early_life_and_education\">Early life and education</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Nathan_Hare&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Early life and education\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Hare was born on his parents' sharecropper farm near the <a href=\"/wiki/Creek_County,_Oklahoma\" title=\"Creek County, Oklahoma\">Creek County</a> town of <a href=\"/wiki/Slick,_Oklahoma\" title=\"Slick, Oklahoma\">Slick, Oklahoma</a>, on April 9, 1933. He attended segregated public schools, L'Ouverture (variously spelled \"Louverture\") Elementary School and L'Ouverture High School. The two schools were named after the Haitian revolutionary and general <a href=\"/wiki/Toussaint_Louverture\" title=\"Toussaint Louverture\">Toussaint Louverture</a>; they were part of the so-called \"Slick Separate Schools\" in the late 1930s and 1940s.\n</p><p>When Hare was eleven years old, his family migrated to <a href=\"/wiki/San_Diego,_California\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"San Diego, California\">San Diego, California</a> during the defense buildup related to World War II. His single mother took a civilian janitorial job with the Navy air station. Hundreds of thousands of blacks left the South to go to California and the West Coast, in the <a href=\"/wiki/Great_Migration_(African_American)\" title=\"Great Migration (African American)\">Great Migration</a> through 1970, totaling 5 million in all. As <a href=\"/wiki/World_War_II\" title=\"World War II\">World War II</a> ended and his mother was laid off, she brought her family back to Oklahoma. This put on hold Hare's ambition to become a professional boxer, an idea he had picked up after adult neighbors in San Diego assured him that writers all starve to death.\n</p><p>Hare's life changed in high school after he was selected in ninth grade to represent the class at the annual statewide \"Interscholastic Meet\" of the black students held at Oklahoma's <a href=\"/wiki/Langston_University\" title=\"Langston University\">Langston University</a>. (His English teacher had administered standardized tests in English Composition, and selected him for his score on the test.)  Hare won first prize at the meet, with more prizes to come in ensuing years. The L'Ouverture principal encouraged him to go to college and arranged for him to start at Langston with a full-time job working in the University Dining Hall to pay his way. By his junior year, Hare was working as a Dormitory Proctor of the University Men, and as a Freshman Tutor in his senior year.\n</p><p>When Hare enrolled at <a href=\"/wiki/Langston_University\" title=\"Langston University\">Langston University</a>, it was the only college to admit Black students in the state of Oklahoma. The town of Langston and the college were named for <a href=\"/wiki/John_Mercer_Langston\" title=\"John Mercer Langston\">John Mercer Langston</a>, one of five African Americans elected to Congress from the South in the late 19th century, before the former Confederate states passed constitutions that effectively <a href=\"/wiki/Disfranchisement_after_Reconstruction_era\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era\">disenfranchised most blacks</a> and ended their participation in politics for decades. The town was founded by black nationalists hoping to make the Oklahoma Territory an all-Black state. <a href=\"/wiki/Langston,_Oklahoma\" title=\"Langston, Oklahoma\">Langston, Oklahoma</a> claimed to being the first all-black town established in the United States.\n</p><p>One of Hare's professors was the poet <a href=\"/wiki/Melvin_B._Tolson\" title=\"Melvin B. Tolson\">Melvin B. Tolson</a>. He was also elected mayor of the town for four terms, and was named <a href=\"/wiki/Poet_laureate\" title=\"Poet laureate\">poet laureate</a> of <a href=\"/wiki/Liberia\" title=\"Liberia\">Liberia</a>. His spectacular style of teaching would be portrayed in <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Great_Debaters\" title=\"The Great Debaters\">The Great Debaters</a>.</i> Graduating from Langston with an AB in Sociology, Hare won a <a href=\"/wiki/Danforth_Fellowship\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Danforth Fellowship\">Danforth Fellowship</a> to continue his education; he obtained an MA (1957) and PhD in Sociology (1962) from the <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_Chicago\" title=\"University of Chicago\">University of Chicago</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Marriage_and_family\">Marriage and family</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Nathan_Hare&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Marriage and family\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Hare married fellow Langston University student Julia.

He was dismissed in June 1967 after becoming increasingly involved with the Black Power movement on campus and leading student-faculty protests.\n</p><p>In 1966 he wrote a letter to the campus newspaper, <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Hilltop_(newspaper)\" title=\"The Hilltop (newspaper)\">The Hilltop</a></i>, mocking Howard president James Nabrit's statement to the <i>Washington Post</i> on September 3, 1966 that he hoped to increase white enrollment at Howard to as much as 60%. Nabrit had been part of the NAACP legal team to successfully argue the 1954 <i><a href=\"/wiki/Brown_vs._Board_of_Education\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Brown vs. Board of Education\">Brown vs. Board of Education</a></i> case before the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional. By 1966, the civil rights movement had achieved passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965. After that, some activists were seeking \"<a href=\"/wiki/Black_Power\" title=\"Black Power\">Black Power</a>,\" as declared <a href=\"/wiki/Stokely_Carmichael\" title=\"Stokely Carmichael\">Stokely Carmichael</a> in Montgomery, Alabama, who was a former student of Hare. (Hare had also taught <a href=\"/wiki/Claude_Brown\" title=\"Claude Brown\">Claude Brown</a>, future author of <i>Manchild in the Promised Land</i>).\n</p><p>On February 22, 1967, Hare held a press conference, with students identified as \"The Black Power Committee,\" and read \"The Black University Manifesto.\" It called for \"the overthrow of the Negro college with white innards and to raise in its place a black university, relevant to the black community and its needs.\" Hare had previously published a book called <i>The Black Anglo Saxons</i>; he coined the phrase, \"The Ebony Tower,\" to characterize Howard University.\n</p><p>In the spring of 1967, Hare invited the champion fighter <a href=\"/wiki/Muhammad_Ali\" title=\"Muhammad Ali\">Muhammad Ali</a> to speak at Howard. He was controversial for statements about black power and as one of numerous opponents to the <a href=\"/wiki/Vietnam_War\" title=\"Vietnam War\">Vietnam War</a>. The champion gave his popular \"Black Is Best\" speech to an impromptu crowd of 4,000 gathered at a moment's notice outside the university's Frederick Douglass Hall. The administration had padlocked the Crampton Auditorium to prevent Ali from speaking there because of his statements against the war, days before he refused to be drafted. Hare was dismissed effective in June 1967.\n</p><p>He briefly resumed his own aborted professional boxing efforts. He won his last fight by a knockout in the first round in the <a href=\"/wiki/Washington_Coliseum\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Washington Coliseum\">Washington Coliseum</a> on December 5, 1967.\n</p><p>Hare was recruited to <a href=\"/wiki/San_Francisco_State\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"San Francisco State\">San Francisco State</a> in February 1968 by <a href=\"/wiki/John_Summerskill\" title=\"John Summerskill\">John Summerskill</a>, the college's liberal president, and the Black Student Union leader Jimmy Garrett. Hare wrote the \"Conceptual Proposal for a Department of Black Studies\"; he coined the term \"ethnic studies\" (which was being called \"minority studies\")when Hare was introduced by Jimmy Garrett to a meeting of the Council of Academic Deans. which was considering the establishment of a program of \"minority studies\" the day Hare arrived on campus.\n</p><p>At San Francisco State, the Black Student Union demanded an \"autonomous Department of Black Studies.\" Hare was soon involved in a five-month strike to establish such a department. The strike was led by The Black Student Union, and backed by the <a href=\"/wiki/Third_World_Liberation_Front\" title=\"Third World Liberation Front\">Third World Liberation Front</a> and the local chapter of the <a href=\"/wiki/American_Federation_of_Teachers\" title=\"American Federation of Teachers\">American Federation of Teachers</a>. a broad range of students and professors participated in the strike, which also included community leaders and the Black Faculty Union headed by Hare. <a href=\"/wiki/Mel_Stewart\" title=\"Mel Stewart\">Mel Stewart</a> was also a member of the Black Faculty Union, but Hare was the only one invited to become a \"quasi-member\" of the Central Committee of the Black Student Union. (Student <a href=\"/wiki/Danny_Glover\" title=\"Danny Glover\">Danny Glover</a> was on the committee prior to his years of becoming a successful Hollywood actor.) Student <a href=\"/wiki/Ronald_Dellums\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Ronald Dellums\">Ronald Dellums</a> spoke almost daily at the noonday strike rallies; he later became a politician, serving in the U.S. Congress and as Mayor of <a href=\"/wiki/Oakland,_California\" title=\"Oakland, California\">Oakland, California</a>.\n</p><p>The student-faculty strike disrupted university operations, and contributed to the firing of the president John Summerskill and resignation of his successor, Robert Smith. The next president was <a href=\"/wiki/S._I._Hayakawa\" title=\"S. I. Hayakawa\">S. I. Hayakawa</a>, a semantics scholar. (He later was elected as a U.S. Senator). Hayakawa used a hard-line strategy to put down the five-month strike, declaring \"martial law\" and arresting a crowd of 557 rallying professors and students (the overwhelming majority of whom were white). Weeks later, on February 28, 1969, Hayakawa dismissed Hare as chairman of the newly formed black studies department, the first in the United States, effective June 1 of that year. Then, Hare met with the Black Student Union and members of the Black Studies faculty as unofficial \"Chairman in Exile\" until the end of the Fall.\n</p><p>Ten years earlier, in 1959, while doing graduate study in <a href=\"/wiki/Northwestern_University\" title=\"Northwestern University\">Northwestern University</a>'s <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=McGill_School_of_Journalism&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"McGill School of Journalism (page does not exist)\">McGill School of Journalism</a>, Hare had been a part-time clerical assistant to Roger F. Hacket, the white editor of the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Journal_of_Asian_Studies\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Journal of Asian Studies\">Journal of Asian Studies</a>.</i> Hare was inspired to dream of editing a \"Journal of Negro Studies\" (\"Negro\" was the commonly used word among blacks in 1959). During the next decade, Hare published articles in such magazines and periodicals as&#160;:  <i><a href=\"/wiki/Ebony_(magazine)\" title=\"Ebony (magazine)\">Ebony</a></i>, <i>Negro Digest</i>, <i>Black World</i>, <i>Phylon Review</i>, Social Forces, <i>Social Education</i>, <i><a href=\"/wiki/Newsweek\" title=\"Newsweek\">Newsweek</a></i>, and <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Times\" title=\"The Times\">The Times</a></i>.\n</p><p>Months after being fired from San Francisco State, Hare teamed with <a href=\"/wiki/Robert_Chrisman\" title=\"Robert Chrisman\">Robert Chrisman</a>, a black faculty member of the college's English Department, and Allen Ross (an independent white intellectual who owned the Graphic Arts of Marin printing company near <a href=\"/wiki/Sausalito\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sausalito\">Sausalito</a>). They founded the journal, <a href=\"/wiki/The_Black_Scholar\" title=\"The Black Scholar\">The Black Scholar</a>: A Journal of Black Studies and Research<i>) in November 1969. The three had met at a bar frequented by San Francisco State faculty members in nearby Stonestown. Hare and Chrisman chipped in $300 each to launch the journal, working from a room that Ross made available to them rent-free in the Graphic Arts building. Ross came to the journal space after his own work to set type into the night.</i>\n</p><p>Other early members of the editorial board included <a href=\"/wiki/Shirley_Chisholm\" title=\"Shirley Chisholm\">Shirley Chisholm</a>, later elected to the US Congress; <a href=\"/wiki/Amiri_Baraka\" title=\"Amiri Baraka\">Imamu Baraka</a>, a noted playwright; <a href=\"/wiki/Angela_Davis\" title=\"Angela Davis\">Angela Davis</a>, scholar and activist; Dempsey Travis, <a href=\"/wiki/Max_Roach\" title=\"Max Roach\">Max Roach</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/John_Oliver_Killens\" title=\"John Oliver Killens\">John Oliver Killens</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Ossie_Davis\" title=\"Ossie Davis\">Ossie Davis</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Shirley_Graham_Du_Bois\" title=\"Shirley Graham Du Bois\">Shirley Graham Du Bois</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Maulana_Karenga\" title=\"Maulana Karenga\">Ron Karenga</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Lerone_Bennett,_Jr.\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Lerone Bennett, Jr.\">Lerone Bennett</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-dispute_1-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-dispute-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The first issue attracted attention because of its cover design. In addition, Hare used it to promote articles and thinkers from the First Pan African Cultural Festival in <a href=\"/wiki/Algiers\" title=\"Algiers\">Algiers</a>, which he had attended.
