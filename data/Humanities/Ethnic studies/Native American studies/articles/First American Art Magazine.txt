The First American Art Magazine is a quarterly art magazine covering contemporary, historical, and ancestral art of Indigenous peoples of the Americas.   The magazine was established in April 2013 "to provide a common platform for Native and non-Native academics, art professionals, artists, collectors, and other interested readers to seriously investigate and celebrate Indigenous American artâ€”from ancestral to 21st century artwork."  The publishing editor is America Meredith (Cherokee Nation);  literary editor is Matthew Ryan Smith, PhD; publicity director is Barbara Harjo; and circulation manager is Melissa Dominguez.  The magazine includes profiles of living Native artists, features articles, and several departments: Recent Developments (news); an "Exploring Native Graphic Design" column; Seven Directions (a top seven list); Advice; Art + Literature; memorials; classified advertising; and reviews of art exhibits, art books, and video/films.  FAAM is distributed by Disticor Magazine Distribution Services, as well as directly by the publisher and at Native American art fairs and conferences. Library Journal selected First American Art Magazine as one of its Best Magazines launched in 2013, and wrote that, "A notable strength of the publication is its emphasis on the work of contemporary artists."
