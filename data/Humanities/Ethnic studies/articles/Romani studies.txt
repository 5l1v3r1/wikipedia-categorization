Romani studies (occasionally Gypsiology) is an emerging interdisciplinary ethnic studies field concerned with the experiences of the Romani people. Very rare (or nonnative) terms for the field include Ziganology,  Ciganology,  Romology,  Romalogy,  and Romistics.  Romani studies draws on aspects of sociology, anthropology, linguistics, and political science. Particular areas of focus include the origins of the Romani people, experiences of persecution and political oppression, the Romani language, Romani society and culture, and Romani customs and traditions. As a formal discipline, Romani studies originated in the United Kingdom in the 1990s, with key contributors including Ian Hancock, Thomas Acton, David Smith, and Michael Stewart. The area of inquiry of Romani studies often extends beyond ethnic Roma to Irish Travellers, Yeniche, and other groups traditionally known as Gypsies. The main publication in this field is the academic journal Romani Studies, which is published by the Gypsy Lore Society and edited by Kimmo Granqvist, Professor in Romani studies at Södertörn University, Stockholm.
