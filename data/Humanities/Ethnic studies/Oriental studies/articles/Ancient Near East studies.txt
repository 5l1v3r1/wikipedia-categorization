Ancient Near East studies (or ANE studies) is the field of academic study of the Ancient Near East (ANE). As such it is an umbrella term for Assyriology, in some cases extending to Egyptology. In Britain the first Assyriological appointments in the University of London date to 1904, when T. G. Pinches of the British Museum was appointed to a professorship.  The following list does not include journals in the field of Old Testament studies.
