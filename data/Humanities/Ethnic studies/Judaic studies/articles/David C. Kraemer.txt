David Charles Kraemer is a professor of Talmud and Rabbinics and the Joseph J. and Dora Abbell Librarian at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America.  As director of the Library, Kraemer "oversees the most extensive collection of Judaica—rare and contemporary—in the Western hemisphere".  Kraemer's books include: He is editor of The Jewish Family: Metaphor and Memory (Oxford, 1989). Kraemer is regularly quoted in the US national, local and Jewish press as an authority on questions related to Jewish practice    and the study of Talmud.   An authority on the laws of kashrut, he has written about the increased stringencies associated with the observance of kashrut. Kramer has pointed out that many who observe kashrut today would not be willing to tolerate the ritual standards of renowned rabbinic authorities such as Akiva, Rashi or Joseph Caro.
