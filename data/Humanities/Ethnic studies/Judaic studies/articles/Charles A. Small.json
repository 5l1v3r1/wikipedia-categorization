Looking at populations in 10 European countries, Small and Kaplan surveyed 5,000 respondents, asking them about Israeli actions and classical anti-Semitic stereotypes. \"There were questions about whether the IDF purposely targets children, whether Israel poisons the Palestinians' water supply - these sorts of extreme mythologies,\" Small says.  They demonstrated that Europeans whose opinions are extremely anti-Israel, are highly likely to also be anti-Semitic. \"The people who believed the anti-Israel mythologies also tended to believe that Jews are not honest in business, have dual loyalties, control government and the economy, and the like,\" Small says. The study demonstrated that an Israel-hating European is 56% more likely to be anti-Semitic than the average European.  \"This is extraordinary. It's off the charts,\" says Small. \"If a food or a drug was 56% more likely to cause cancer, it would be taken off the shelf.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Books\">Books</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Charles_A._Small&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Books\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li>The ISGAP Papers: Antisemitism in Comparative Perspective, 2016, ISGAP, New York</li>\n<li>The Yale Papers: Antisemitism in Comparative Perspective, 2015, ISGAP, New York</li>\n<li>Global Antisemitism: A Crisis of Modernity An Introduction, 2014, New York</li>\n<li>Global Antisemitism: A Crisis of Modernity, ISGAP Publishers, 2013 VI Volume, New York.</li>\n<li>Global Antisemitism: A Crisis of Modernity, Brill Press, Amsterdam, 2013.</li>\n<li>Social Theory - an Historical Analysis of Canadian Socio-Cultural Policies, 'Race' and The 'Other': A Case Study of Social and Spatial Segregation in Montreal, Eleven International Publishing, Amsterdam, 2013.</li>\n<li>Charles Asher Small, Olufemi Vaughan and M.
