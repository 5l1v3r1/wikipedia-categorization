Monatsschrift für die Geschichte und Wissenschaft des Judenthums ("Monthly magazine for science and history of Judaism", abbreviated to MGWJ) is a monthly journal devoted to the science of Judaism. It was founded by Zecharias Frankel in Dresden in 1851, following the suppression of Zeitschrift für die Religiösen Interessen des Judenthums in 1846.  It was published in Germany for 83 years between 1851 and 1939  (except in 1887–1892)   In time, it became the leading journal in the Jewish world.  Frankel believed that the objects striven for in the contest of 1848 had been attained, and that the Jews no longer had separate political interests. He therefore considered that the time had arrived for them to undertake a scientific investigation of their history and literature.  The first seventeen volumes of the "Monatsschrift" were edited by Frankel, who was succeeded by the historian Heinrich Graetz. The latter edited vols. xviii. to xxxvi. inclusive, being assisted by Pinkus Frankl of Berlin in vols. xxxiii. to xxxv. Publication was stopped in 1887, but was resumed in 1892, with Marcus Brann  and David Kaufmann as joint editors (vols. xxxvii. to xliii.). Upon Kaufmann's death (1899) Brann became sole editor. Since Jan., 1904, the "Monatsschrift" has appeared as the organ of the Gesellschaft zur Förderung der Wissenschaft des Judenthums.  The "Monatsschrif" was first published in Dresden. Some volumes were then issued in Krotoschin and some in Berlin; but the greatest number appeared in Breslau. A complete table of contents for the first seventeen volumes is appended to vol. xvii., and a similar table for the years 1869 to 1887 is given at the end of vol. xxxvi. This table has been published separately also.
