This also involves significant attention being given to the <a href=\"/wiki/Inquisition\" title=\"Inquisition\">Inquisition</a> and to its ramifications for <a href=\"/wiki/Sephardic_Jews\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sephardic Jews\">Sephardic Jews</a> as well as for the general <a href=\"/wiki/Jewish\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Jewish\">Jewish</a> community. \n</p><p>Membership in the SCJS is composed of scholars interested in crypto-Jews, descendants of crypto-Jews, and others interested in the topic from a historical, sociological, anthropological, religious, ethnic, literary, philosophical, or other perspective. The Society is nonreligious, and membership is open to all. Today, there is much interest, both academic and personal, in the history and contemporary status of crypto-Jews, and a number of distinguished scholars have published in the area. Especially in recent years, a number of people, especially, but not limited to, <a href=\"/wiki/Hispanics\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hispanics\">Hispanics</a>, have returned or converted to Judaism, frequently in part because of knowledge of a previously-suppressed Jewish heritage. <a href=\"/wiki/New_Mexico\" title=\"New Mexico\">New Mexico</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Texas\" title=\"Texas\">Texas</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Arizona\" title=\"Arizona\">Arizona</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/California\" title=\"California\">California</a> are major areas of interest, but significant interest also is found in <a href=\"/wiki/Miami\" title=\"Miami\">Miami</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Florida\" title=\"Florida\">Florida</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Orlando,_Florida\" title=\"Orlando, Florida\">Orlando, Florida</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/New_York_City\" title=\"New York City\">New York City</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Portland,_Oregon\" title=\"Portland, Oregon\">Portland, Oregon</a>, and other areas with large numbers of <a href=\"/wiki/Hispanic\" title=\"Hispanic\">Hispanics</a>. This contemporary phenomenon of returning/converting also is of specific interest to some academic researchers.\n</p><p>The SCJS publishes <i>HaLapid</i>: The Journal of the Society for Crypto-Judaic Studies, a combination newsletter and journal. Published four times per year, <i>HaLapid</i> (Hebrew for The Torch) mostly includes refereed academic research articles, personal stories by descendants of crypto-Jews, and news items, but also includes occasional poetry, links for related websites, and other items of interest. The SCJC also hosts a website, and helps answer questions and make referrals for interested persons.\n</p><p>The Society for Crypto-Judaic Studies meets annually for a three-day conference which includes a keynote speaker, sessions on recent research findings, personal stories of returnees, business sessions, and various forms of entertainment. At the 2003 annual conference in San Antonio, Texas, the keynote speaker was retired Rabbi Samuel Lerer who spent much of his 51-year career working with anusim in Mexico. The SCJS has taken a lead in interest in <a href=\"/wiki/DNA\" title=\"DNA\">DNA</a> studies, especially as it applies to crypto-Jews, other Sephardim, and the Jewish community in general.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Notes\">Notes</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Society_for_Crypto-Judaic_Studies&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Notes\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li>Janet Liebman Jacobs, <i>Hidden Heritage: The Legacy of the Crypto-Jews</i> (2002), p.&#160;13.</li>\n<li><span class=\"citation wikicite\" id=\"endnote_1\"><b><a href=\"#ref_1\">^</a></b></span>  The well-known Judaica author <a href=\"/wiki/Cecil_Roth\" title=\"Cecil Roth\">Cecil Roth</a> popularized the term <a href=\"/wiki/Marranos\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Marranos\">marranos</a> in his 1932 book <i>A History of the Marranos</i>, but, because of the negative meaning attached to the word marrano by supporters of the Inquisition, today the term preferred by descendants and scholars is Crypto-Jews (i.e., Secret Jews), or <a href=\"/wiki/Anusim\" title=\"Anusim\">anusim</a> (<a href=\"/wiki/Hebrew_language\" title=\"Hebrew language\">Hebrew</a> for forced ones)</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"External_links\">External links</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Society_for_Crypto-Judaic_Studies&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: External links\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.cryptojews.com/\">Society for Crypto-Judaic Studies webpage</a></li></ul>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw1265\nCached time: 20180911220250\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.016 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.023 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 60/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 379/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 4/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 4/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    5.700      1 -total\n 62.53%    3.564      1 Template:Note\n 36.02%    2.053      1 Template:Ref\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:1838453-0!canonical and timestamp 20180911220249 and revision id 765191470\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","*":"Judaic_studies"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Jewish_history_organizations"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Sephardi_Jewish_culture_in_the_United_States"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Crypto-Judaism"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Anusim"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Arizona"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"California"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Cecil Roth"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Crypto-Jews"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"DNA"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Florida"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Hebrew language"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Hispanic"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Hispanics"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Inquisition"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Jewish"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Marranos"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Miami"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"New Mexico"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"New York City"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Orlando, Florida"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Portland, Oregon"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Portugal"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Santa Fe, New Mexico"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Sephardic Jews"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Spain"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Texas"}],"templates":[{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Ref"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Note"}],"images":[],"externallinks":["http://www.cryptojews.com/"],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Notes","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Society_for_Crypto-Judaic_Studies","byteoffset":2774,"anchor":"Notes"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"External links","number":"2","index":"2","fromtitle":"Society_for_Crypto-Judaic_Studies","byteoffset":3268,"anchor":"External_links"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Society for Crypto-Judaic Studies","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q7552098"}]}}
