Henricus Hornkens, sometimes cited as Henri or Heinrich (died 1612) was a 16th-century priest and lexicographer. Hornkens served Philip II of Spain and Philip III of Spain as a court chaplain. In 1598 he accompanied the Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia to the Low Countries, where he became dean of the church of St Gummarus in Lier, Duchy of Brabant. He compiled a French-Spanish-Latin dictionary that was published in Brussels in 1599 and was used by CÃ©sar Oudin in his own lexicographical work. He died in 1612.
